"Novotel Bangkok Platinum Pratunam locates literary few steps away from the Central World and Siam Square area. Extremely convenient location with easy access to all the glitterings Bangkok is famous for. Room is quite spacious with a great view overlooking the sleepless streets. My stay was made possible thanks to Ms. Rachaporn‚Äôs (Reservation) professional and immediate assistance and the whole experience was elevated to another level because of Mr. Q and Mr. New‚Äôs (Front Office) warm service. Mr. Q verified my last-minute booking in an efficient manner, and introduced me to the features of this property. It was rare to encounter this level of service at a city hotel. One can tell Mr. Q really enjoys his work and he is definitely an essential asset to the team. Special shout-out"

"If you're for a really comfy bed this is the place for you! If you're looking forward to a wonderful breakfast you'll be disappointed. If you're hoping to enjoy the benefits of the executive wing don't do it! It's just not worth the money. I booked 2 rooms on the executive floor hoping to simply unwind and enjoy but alas, with only 2 different ""snacks"" to choose from (both of which were very cold!) and a limited stock of drinks and an uninviting area (very small & cramped I might add) it was such a disappointment we never went back to the lounge. The real plus, though, on the executive floor were our rooms (both corner rooms)! They were spacious and the bathroom had a his & hers basin, a bathtub, a seperate shower room and a separate toilet. If you're simply wanting to enjoy the"

Had so much fun having my chill time on Novotel Platinum  Pratunam‚Äôs bar View Bangkok. Garfield and James are so professional and fun. They made sure that we are well catered and accommodated. The food and drinks are all good and are priced reasonably. This is a great spot to have fun and chill in the heart of Bangkok.
"The best bar in bangkok during covid-19, me and my friend was having nightlife in bangkok during this time, however we found out this bar and they offer great drinks with a great service staff name garfield! He offer us best drinks and we had so much fun."
"I'm normally reluctant to 5 star an experience but for this hotel I'll make an exception.  Service: friendly and professional.  Room: we booked a ""king suite', and it was simply a dream...Totally unfaultable...Everything top quality...The stylish bathroom, the lounge with its own TV, the bedroom superb and a view through the panoramic windows to kill for.  The breakfast: scrumptious with multiple choices (including Marmite!) and wonderful coffee.  Also, with this particular room came the feature of free wine, beer and canap√©s in the early evening.  Check in and out: uneventful.  So good overall that we're booking the Siam Square Hotel in a couple of weeks..."
"This view in bangkok was so good, while we talk about bangkok. This bar is always the best for me. Because a drink prices are bot too expensive. On others hand, the views of this bar is so nice according to this bar places at the hub of bangkok so you can see the city views. In addition, the taste of drink are so nice and the staffs are very nice service too for example, Khun nan and Kafew. So I will come back again on next time moreover I will reccommend it to my friends."
"Excellent hospitality, location, excellent hotel. We experienced extreme comfort. Highly recommended. Thanks Miss Fon for your warm welcome and assistance everytime we needed your help. You made our stay very comfortable. You really deserve to be at the front desk. Thank you so much. To Mr. Mark for his kind assistance during our check out, thanks."

"The hotel is just a walking distance to Central World and BTS Siam station. Mr. Mark Reyes, the one who checked us in, was very warm and accommodating. He really knows how to receive guests and make them comfortable. In fact, I got a room upgrade from standard room to executive suite room."
We enjoyed our stay at Novotel Bangkok Platinum Pratunam - SHA Certified. We were accommodated by the front desk officer Mark Reyes and he's very welcoming and hands on. Our room is so elegant with the hightech toilet glasswindow and it has wonderful view of the city.

"While I was in here during the COVID-19 Pandemic, I enjoyed the music here. They play house music, so if you are into that it‚Äôs great. The food is nice and the cocktails are great. It‚Äôs also very easy to get to, as it is accessible to all the 3 train routes. You can even get here by the Airport Rail Link. Not to mention it is also right next to Central World, a major destination. It‚Äôs also directly connected to the Novotel Hotel, so if you are staying there, it is as easy as turning left at the reception.  The cocktails are reasonably priced. They are priced a bit higher than other places but since you are situated right in the heart of Bangkok (literally next to Central World and to some extent Siam Discovery / Siam Center) it‚Äôs reasonable to be charged some extra to get that"
"This review marks the 7th stay with this hotel. It's a perfect location (without the need to take a BTS) for shopping and dining! Surrounded by all famous malls, wholesale pratunam market, restaurants, massages and famous SabX2 Wanton Noodles just mins walk away. Pleasant service and rooms are always well kept. Buffet breakfast is a nice delight as well with a good variety. Needless to say, I will be coming back again!"

"My first time visit to this hotel with my family, m very happy with the stay. We stayed between 16 March till 19th March. Suggest taking a grab car from the airport. We booked a family room that come with the bunk bed. Room is quite spacious with comfy bed. My kids love the bunk bed because there is some soft toys. Location is very good, connected to shopping mall. Nearby fast food like MCD, Burger king, A&W and etc. Food court located in the shopping mall top floor. Money changer, atm and massage parlors is also walking distance. I was lucky during that period there is a street food stall right outside the hotel. No shortage of food choice. Train station is quite a walking distance (10-15 minute) Sight seeing location is not far off like Wat Arun/Wat Pho. Can also use grab car"

"The best service in BKK We didn‚Äôt stay here but we came here only for dinner buffet. In the period of Covid-19, the hotel was so much care about all guests, from G floor to the restaurant, I felt safe here 99.99% from the virus. Hostess was so politely and welcoming us. The atmosphere and the music quite boring for me. But there are good things as well ,almost items looked so clean as you can see all the covers, kitchen staff were always staying at the station. Tawan was so nice, EXCELLENT service staff ever, I saw him at the grill station after that he came to served that food for us then he cleared the empty plate!!! You are my man!! Dessert made me so happy at the end. Last but not least, even some foods hadn‚Äôt had in the line but they were provided the items and apparently"
