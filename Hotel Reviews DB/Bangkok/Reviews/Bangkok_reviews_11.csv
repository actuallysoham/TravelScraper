If you are you looking for a good place for Vacation or long stays I highly recommend this place the price is very reasonable and very good deal and the staff is very generously. And the parking lot is very convenient for the guess who has the private car.
‚ÄúVery friendly hospitable place to stay. Staff super friendly and helpful. Room very clean and comfortable. Great food in the bar/restaurant area. Highly recommended and we will be back for our next stay for sure ‚Äù
Once in a lifetime to experience penthouse at Siri Sathorn Hotel. The penthouse view was superb! The staffs were really nice and supportive. The breakfast was delicouse and has lots of variety. I would love to come back and visit again!
"comfortable room.  Available in a variety of styles  According to requirement  It is in the business district  And leading department stores  Comfortable travel  Suitable for resting on the tired day, recommend you to come and try to stay."
"Great service and super friendly staff. Helped me to my room with all my bags at 1.30am when i checked in. Very polite helped me to a room upgrade for a very good price, because the previous room was to small."
"I regulary visit Siri Sathorn at least once a month, stay ing at heart of BKK with easy access by both car and BTS made this hotel my favorite in BKK. -The parking lots is accessible from within 1-2 circle down, not like some drive to heaven parking lot -Staff also very nice, you can feel the good atmosphere around the lobby -Room : nice interior and extraodinary view from various aspect -Price match the quality and location summary 9/10"
"Stuck in Thailand coz Covid but how great it is. I prefer the location, decorates and service. Staff is friendly and helpful throughout. The rooms are specious and comfortable. Pool is nice. Over a period of stay I'm deeply impressed with them. Absolutely recommended!"
"I am very satisfied for this hotel indeed as I can use the space for cooking.  Moreover, the stuffs are very helpful for any doubts. I am the one who supports this hotel and highly recommend for staying this!"
Hotel room is clean and comfortable with full kitchen funcilities living room is big smart TV we only ate in the restaurant once because there are so many other option nearby but the food was very good we would be happy to stay there again and again
Such a great experience to sleep over at Siri Sathorn. Value for money place. Friendly and  humble staff. The place is bear CBD sathorn and silom location. Opposite of siri sathorn is venue The Common. Plently of food nearby too. Wish you guys could come.
"The first premier suite i got was really in bad condition and smelly as there is a restaurant exhaust air outlet next to the room. 501 and other x01 rooms are affected. Next room i got was better but still mouldy in the bathroom. Only one towel... Poor wifi. Pool, gym and breakfast were good"
"Pleasant staff who were helpful. Smallish double room (cheapest, I think 600). Very comfortable clean room. Quiet - what I wanted.  Good amenities including room wifi and restaurant.Handy for Silom and BTS - 10 minute walk or motor-bike taxis always there. Would stay again at these prices.  Liked best - comfortable room. Liked least - temporary problem with lift and keycard."
"From arrival to departure staff are very accommodating, professional and courteous.  I am greeted by name, doors are opened for me and both check in and check out are seamless, smooth and prompt.  Reception and Security have always been of highest standard and professional.   Rooms vary in size and configuration to suit any traveler. I have always found if availability permits and I request it staff will attempt to find me a larger room or one with other facilities, from full kitchen to basic mini bar, crisp air conditioning, spotless rooms, crisp linen and amenities.  And on occasion balcony. I cannot speak highly enough of the staff I've had the good fortune to come to know, the convenience and proximity to BTS, readily available taxis and a multitude of store, shops, delivery"
"For about 800 Bht a night its an ok hotel. What amazes me is the lack of attention to the small details, for example, the room was quite spacious but sparse, no problem there. The toilet is nicely fitted out with a rain shower and lashings of hot water, but, how long would it take to scrub the mould from the tiles? Would it be so hard to adjust the feet on the fridge? Just small details that make the place look cared for and loo seat that is loose and not square with the loo. Watch out for the family jewels. Would we stay here again? Yes."
I stayed in room with the kitchen. Very very cheap price and full amenities. The service is great. All staff were friendly and helpful. Variety choices of breakfast and good taste. Hotel is nearby BTS Saladaeng and Silom subway which is convenience to go from place to place. And near the Lumpini Park is for morning jogging. Even hotel will provide  full facilities fitness swimming pool sauna and massage shop.   I totally recommend you to stay here without any doubt and worth to pay.
"This hotel is conveniently located about 10 minutes walk from the Sala Daeng BTS and Silom Road, or the hotel provides a shuttle service during the day. The reception staff were efficient and friendly. We booked a Premier One Bedroom which was extremely good value. The room has a kitchen with fridge, stove, micro wave, with plates abd utensils. If you need anything else for the kitchen just call Housekeeping. There was a sofa and coffee table and a good sized flat screen TV, as well as a desk and lamp.The bedroom has a comfortable bed, safe, and wardrobes. The bathroom is a good size with toiletries provided. Basically it is a serviced apartment. We didnt have a view, just the building nextdoor, but higher up you would, or at the front or rear of the building (we were on the"
My first experience after they transform to new management team. Low hygiene. Mold on the carpet. No warm or hot shower. No bell boy.  Cheap price but still need hygiene environment. Cant wait to try BF. I am happy to pay more for a better hotel. √ó√ó√ó√ó üôÑPleass check mold on the carpet. Scary.
"This hotel should not earn a 4 star rating. The staff barely speak english and they will not resolve any matter pertaining to room issue.  We booked a suite during our stay. The carpet inside the room has many stains and it smells moldy. Both phones in the living room and inside the room are not working at all. The bathroom is filthy and the hot water is not stable, it will get cold suddenly and will get really hot. The front desk was informed but nothing was done to resolve this issue.  Breakfast was mediocre. Location of the hotel is so so. There are 2 7-11 within walking distance and there are a few restaurants nearby.  Once in a while, there are also guests who bring ""working woman"" late at night and the hotel does not have strict policy about it. This hotel is not really"
I briefly stayed at this hotel after a nip and tuck and I have to say the beds are extremely comfortable and the hotel is very clean. but cleanliness and comfort. I would stay here again.very nice staff.
"We stayed at this hotel 2nd time. We love the location, cleanliness,  hospitality and huge sized peaceful rooms. Breakfast very rich and has good value. Strongly recommended for families! Have a good stay"
"The room is compact, yet the location is convenient. They also provide shuttle service around Silom Area. The hotel is within the walking distance to both BTS (Silom Station) and MRT (Lumphini Station and Silom Station), not to mention various bus stops."
"All Good. Good Value and Location, nice welcoming and helpful staff. Plus a gym ! Can walk to Silom and transport, take a walk in Lumphini park. Now my usual place to stay in Bangkok. I have stayed three time now."
"Just completed my fourth stay at Siri Sathorn Suites- the value is unbeatable. I loved the two bedroom suites but now they‚Äôve refurbished to transform them into Family Suites it‚Äôs even better. Staying with friends you get your own adjoining one bedroom suite with a shared entrance. This allows you to have the inner doors open so the kitchen, dining and living are are shared while providing you with the privacy of your own room and on suite bathrooms. Can‚Äôt wait for Them to give me a complimentary upgrade to the penthouse suite!"
"It was my first time to stay here and I was impressed with my premier suite room. I like a full kitchen that you can cook if you have time üòú A large clean room, nice bathroom, good living room, great kitchen so everything was perfect ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"It's a good place to stay for all purpose epecially business. Front desk staffs are friendly and helpful for all details also fast check in. Room is amazing, clean,  spacious and good view. Kitchen area is very good for cooking and baking as well. Breakfast restaurant is wonderful and over than expectation, they quite big and good scene near the pool. Good food and lovely coffee, really enjoyed. Check out process is smooth and always great service. Special thanks to Khun Rudy and all staffs that made me feeling amazing all the time. Definitely I will be coming back and stay with you. Highly recommend for any customers who looking for business hub area and leisure purposes as well.   Best regards,   Jackie C."
Everything is so good enough. Room is very comfortable. The location is easy for traveling. Service is ok. Hope to come back again and also hope to get a very good deal & good service again in the next visit to Bangkok.
"Staff were very helpful and supportive (Excellent services), breakfast was great, a lot of variety and good taste. We booked at very cheap rate but we got spacious room. Need improvement on air-con system which was difficult to control temperature, too cold.., housekeeping standard should be improved, amenities were not well-prepared, no vaccuming on daily basis. Room design was not practical, no sofa bed in the living room for main family room."
"I booked this hotel because I have been here twice to visit my friends who stayed here ; the room is very good although the air-conditional is loud.  However,  my personal experience with the staff has been more than dissatisfaction.  When I first requested two additional bottles of drinking water, I was told the usual practice is two bottles only.  I seriously cannot understand the big deal of giving two more bottles.  Would that cost the hotel a bomb?  Or is the hotel worried that every guest would demand for two additional bottles?  If there is a convenient shop nearby I would not have bothered to ask for additional drinking water, but there is no 7/11 or whatsoever nearby.  Later when I requested for late check out at 14:00pm on 25th October (tomorrow), I was told that the"
"Rooms are well furnished., Good comfortable beds.. in bathroom they are giving very good herbal shampoo and body wash...really good quality..  Well trained and friendly staff,. I like sitting in lobby.. good interior.,."
"This is our 3rd long stay at the Siri Sathorn in 2020. My Wife & I are very impressed with the location and more importantly the staff. The staff are friendly helpful & professional, from the check in reception staff, the doormen & the cleaning staff are all first rate. They make us feel very welcome. The rooms are spacious and great value.  The central location is great for early morning coffee , plenty of restaurants & shopping near by. All round great positive vibe ."
"I booked a very particular type of room (1 BR designer suite as i used to stay there before) which upon arrival, it was not the same as picture i saw (nor pictures i took on my last trip) on booking website. so i asked to change the room but they said room is being cleaned, at 2 pm, i asked to see the room first to make sure it is the same room i booked, surprisingly, it was not and room was a complete mess. Manager was called, and she was very nice and all, she quickly solved the problem and we finally got to the room we booked originally at around  3 pm. But at the point, i was so hungry i almost faint, luckily, the manager called up to check if the room was ok and offer us free meal from kitchen, save me from hunger. Food was ok, nothing great, but suffice our hunger (as well"
"Yesterday I am checked In at Siri Sathorn started with not a great thing cause my lab top had steal from somewhere not involve these hotel. But when all staff knew about my issue. all staff Front office member include Bell Man and security support me with anyway in meanwhile a lot guest. It's very impressive for my side and very appreciate for support me. I am in the one voice for guarantee about good service and do care the best to the customer. Thank you for all of you.    Your service more than welcome. Big Hug and Cheer,"
My friend were visiting Bangkok and I decided to take break and spend a weekend with them in Bangkok. They recommended the hotel. Very well appointed and spacious suits. The working desk came Andy to attend my morning calls with clients. Shower was very neat and clean. Overall it was a good stay
"Hotel itself is fine. Not new, but clean and comfortable. There was a little kitchen in the room. Nice restaurant. Good location. Pool (but I was surprised that the water was cold), gym. Not luxury but functional enough.  There were 2 problems. First and the main one - construction nearby. They start to work early in the morning (including weekend) and end late in the evening. Second - curtains are not blackout.  After sunrise the were a lot of light in the room. Therefore if you combine noise and light you get early wake up) what was very uncomfortable for me."
Everything good Poll gym fitness locker room very nice Only one thing the L/D reception morning shift make me feel  uncomfortable breakfast and coffee delicious The room very big nice bathroom..............
"I didn't believe it when i booked this hotel  online 5 stars and for less than 23 dollars.i said their might be something wrong but it definitely exceeded my expectation the rooms are spacious,there is a two bathrooms one with a big bath tube and even a kitchen fully equipped.It was just wow. MRT station near by and the beautiful lumpini park jut 10 min walking"
"Maybe to do low tourist, this hotel had an excellent value to quality ratio. Seriously recommend this place for service, value, amenities, pool , fitness room, restaurant. Lovely area to walk. Lumphini park nearby. Mass transit in walking distance."
"If you prefer space to be able to spread out when you stay over, this is the place for you.  I stayed in a suite with kitchen, lounge, bedroom and well appointed bathroom.  The bed was one of the best that I have ever slept in with excellent bedding and pillows.  For those fitness minded there is an excellent gym and those wanting to cool off there is a small outside pool.  All the staff I met were very friendly with a good standard of spoken English."
The beds were very comfortable and the internet was great. The cable had many good channels too. Though it would be nice to be able to connect to the internet more conveniently instead of having to ask for a access code for every device/
"We spent over here for our personal business in Silom. Room is spacious, clean and comfortable. Check in is smooth. Staff is polite. We try breakfast for first night and it is not bad.   Location is in Saladaeng Soi 1. It is in walk distance to BTS and MRT.   Highly recommended here üëç"
"Excellent property.  Rooms always perfect and quiet. Khun Ja-GM and team very friendly. Hotel facilities is good, location is near to BTS & MRT  walk 10 minutes.   Prices are very competitive. You cannot wrong  here!"
"I stayed here by myself. I could say the room is quite big and shower room as well. I really enjoyed having a bath here. upon check-in, they give a small toothpaste and that was very cute. The gym is fully equipped, but the swimming pool is a bit small it seems more like a jacuzzi. I liked everything, but there are so many rats on the way from from BTS to the hotel."
"We picked this hotel due to its relative proximity to the embassy, and its overall rating. It was WAY more expensive than many other of our choices, but seemed worth while.  The staff was very friendly, the food at the restaurant was really good. Unfortunately, the room was DISGUSTING. Every time I entered the room, my allergies flared up and I spent several miserable nights trying to sleep. Additionally, 75% of the horizontal surfaces covered in fabric contained ""stains"" of the biological variety. It made it very difficult to relax in bed, or on the sofas, or window seats. We attempted to contact management about our concerns during our stay, and were never contacted. My husband, my daughter and I could've chosen much better for much less. I WOULD NOT recommend this hotel."
"Good location not too far from major metro/light rail transport but amazingly quiet for its position in the heart of the craziness that is Bangkok! Our room was enormous and had a kitchenette although we didn't really use it a lot as there are loads of nearby eating options - though the fridge was certainly very useful. The ensuite shower/bathroom was nicely appointed and always plenty of hot water. Only had breakfast on our first morning - it was very good with a huge choice, just didn't feel we needed a big breakfast with all the food options Bangkok has on offer. The staff are all lovely and the doorman in his traditional costume was unfailingly jolly, and the room was kept very clean with fresh towels every day. Good aircon (essential), not too noisy  though not as quiet as"
"Althogh the place is really aging, Siri Sathorn is still my second home in Bangkok. The service is good, the staff very friendly and always helpful. I really hope that they will renovate the rooms soon!"
"About the check in ... I arrived at Siri Sathorn, early in morning, totally exhausted after a long international flight. I was happily  surprised to discover that my room (a junior suite) was available and ready. I paid and ... things changed immediatly. The lady at the counter, without mentioning that before, told me that I cannot get the room until 12pm unless I pay an additional amount ! What kind of policy is it if not racket ? I can easily understand to wait until 12pm or even 2pm when rooms are not available but it wasn't the case. Forgot to mention that I, and my wife too, used to stay for long periods at Siri Sathorn. No need to say that it is the last time."
"We stayed here at the beginning and end of our Thailand trip.   The location suited us as a family with two kids - it's reasonably quiet as it seems to be surrounded by other hotels, serviced apartments and office blocks with the bonus of being able to walk to both the BTS (Sala Daeng) and MRT (Silom), which meant we didn't need taxis to get to where we want.  The hotel provides a free shuttle every 30 mins (do check when they begin and end though) to either of these places if you don't feel like the 10 minute walk.   On the walk to the BTS station there is an outdoor food centre which has all sorts of interesting stalls, try get here before or after the lunchtime rush where lots of office workers come and eat.  Next to the BTS station is Silom Centre which has a TOPS"
Hotel room is clean and comfortable with full kitchen facilities. Living room is big. There is a TV in the living room and the main bedroom. There are 2 toilets and 2 basins in the main bedroom toilet.
"A full length mirror should be nearby the bedroom and not literally in front of the front door where we steps in and out with our dirty shoes. It's pretty difficult for us to keep standing in front of the closed toilet door for grooming. The hot water/cold water adjustment in the bathroom is crazy. I Adjusted abit to the hot side and I becomes way too hot, adjust a bit to the cold side and it becomes way too cold and when it's perfect, even when you don't touch it, it turns it's temperature to be too hot. I obviously didn't enjoy showering there. Fix it! I stayed there for 3 weeks, I pahid alot of money as well as in Jan 2019 and August 2019 too. So I know how this hotel works really well! In room dining caller, female staff, working in the well established hotel industry but"
"This place is not just a room, it is a real small condo with kitchen, a sofa, a writing area and a nice bedroom and bathroom.  Very well located in Sathorn Sala Daeng area with plenty of nice restaurants nearby and the sky train at reach ... A very good place and address indeed !!!"
"My 2nd family stay in 12 months over Christmas 2019. Trip booked via Expedia therefore when my son could not make trip we requested to change to a suite to accommodate my 11yr old with us.Suites were available but hotel would not change due to Expedia non change booking rules. This meant my 11yr old was staying in room by herself which was not safe/practical. Flyer left in room on Christmas Day informing of restaurant closed Christmas Day due to staff party-poor notice for residents. Room service took 1hr 15mins, meals cold and covered with glad wrap. Restaurant experience average at best. Construction across road super noisy 24/7 Plenty of better hotels closer to centre at similar cost/quality."
"The place is pleasant. It needs refurbishment and modernisation. The staff are OK, some really good, others plain average. The same with their grasp of English.  The area is lively but nowhere near as bustling as sukhumvit or other places. Family friendly and good value for money.  I would stay there again."
"I stayed 2 nights in this beautiful hotel on 13 and 14 December. It is very central in the city centre - only 10 minutes walk to the MRT station and Silom road shopping. The staff were friendly and courteous. My room was very spacious, clean and comfortable.  On the 15th, I checked out in the morning, left the luggage at the reception and went for sightseeing. It was a very hot day in Bangkok and I was exhausted when I returned to collect my luggage. In preparation for my 9 hour night time flight back to Australia, I asked the girls at the reception if I could freshen up a bit. Then they said I could have a shower in their shower room in the gym - a service I wasn't expecting after checking out. The guy looking after the gym kindly offered me a fresh bath towel and the shower"
I must take the time to give a huge thank you and credit to Kun J and his team. They go to all lengths to make our time there feel like home. Especially Kun J - he understands teenagers and husbands and everything and everyone- truly insightful human being. The apartments are very clean and spacious and they will take care of any special requirements no questions asked. Just their job!
Spacious modern suites include good kitchen and a great bed. Staff uniformly pleasant and helpful. Good location -- less than 10 minute walk to the Skytrain. Lots of dining options around. The orchid on my pillow always made me smile.
"There was 3 of us who stayed in a deluxe two bedroom room suite I must say the room was very clean and modern also great value for money, I would recommend this property for any one travelling in a group of 3 or 4"
Excellent facility. Very spacious suits which is clean and well stocked. Temperature control was very good. Location is in a quiet place but not too far from transport facilities. The hotel has a very good restaurant . Buffet breakfast was excellent too. The only one negative mark is for the pillows  in the room. They are way too thick therefore uncomfortable.
I stay here every time I arrive in Bangkok it is a pleasure  clean friendly with very professional staff the pool is great rooms are clean and comfortable very spacious the location is good i like to walk a lot so lumpini park is 5mins away
"All in all Siri Sathorn does a good job for what it charges. The rooms are comfy and large, the setting of the bed in the suites is fabulous. What it needs though is some redecoration soon, new colors and materials and just an update. The price is not bad but for bkk the market is so huge and choices unlimited with hotels, so this property needs to stay in touch!  Pool is great yet sunbeds at 4 pieces are way too little on a crowded day.   The gym is nice and well maintained by the staff. Sauna is a big plus.   Pricing of hotel restaurant and bar is great! Not overcharging for every little item is appreciated. I would consider this property for my next stay 2 months away"
"Spent a week at Siri Sathorn and unable to fault it. The staff were incredibly efficient and friendly, the property was spotless and location-wise it is perfect. Only 10-minute walk to Silom or Lumphini MRT stations and Saladaeng BTS. Lumphini Park is only a 15-minute walk as is Patpong Road and plenty of street food nearby."
"Was satisfied with services and room except roll down blinds, dissent block out lights in room. Toilet need upgrade shower drainage, get well wet on floor especially with bath tub room. Hope to see improvement next time."
"I always like this facility as it's location is very convenient. The staff is friendly and the room clean.  When I requested for a plastic stool /chair in the bathroom, I was rejected. Thus, I reckon that the hotel is not elderly friendly"
"After years of frequent visit, this hidden gem of bangkok, as I'd like to classify it as, is still the best. Ratings are as shown via each category for your easy reading...  Service: 9.7/10 - Special thanks to Ms. Thanatchapohn at the reception for seamless checking-in and service with a smile. Kup! Stay: 9.2/10 - comfortable and clean room EVERY SINGLE DAY as though a brand new check-in.  Location: 9/10 - Walkable near to train station for easy transportation. Near mini marts, pharmacies, restaurants, local delights, massages, etc Lively and safe! Food 8.9/10: Restaurant packs a powerful reputation for its luncheon buffet. Highly recommended for a lazy afternoon if you do not feel like venturing out.  Amenities 9.2/10: Nice pool to cool of the heat, and a compact gym for your"
"Not only is the hotel in a good location, the rooms are large and comfortable.  The pool is large and inviting and the gym is excellent.  We only ate in the restaurant once, only because thee are so many other options nearby, but the food was very good.  We would be happy to stay there again."
"We have been coming here for years but have noticed that each time we stay the standards are slipping. The rooms remain fairly well maintained but the breakfast is declining in quality. Bread is stale, there is no longer any muesli & there is a very limited choice in pastries. In fact, one morning they told me that they forgot to order them. Tea tastes like coffee because they use the same jugs. Can't fault the staff at the Siri but the breakfast manager or management, in general, needs to rethink their breakfast offerings."
Siri Sathorn was within walking distance to public transportation. There were many street food vendors and restaurants within a very short walk. The pool is very clean and often we were the only ones swimming. The staff was friendly and the 2-bedroom apartment was very spacious.
"Everyone in the hotel is friendly and helpful, the room was fantastic, the pool was a welcome relief, the breakfast was nice, the location was good, close to lumphini park and also close to the metro. We had a pleasant stay in Siri Sathorn."
"Wow! Where to start? To be honest, I wish we‚Äôd had more time to enjoy this hotel. We stayed for two nights on our return to Bangkok from Koh Samui before flying home to the uk. We picked the hotel due to it being close to the train line- very convenient for getting to the shopping centres.  We stopped in a 2 bedroom apartment and it was huge! It was set out as if you  could live there for a year! The kitchen was great and well stocked, the bedrooms well designed for storage and the bathrooms were amazing!   customer service was great and they couldn‚Äôt have done any more for us. We would definitely return to this hotel when we next visit Bangkok. Thanks for making the end of our holiday so wonderful!"
I keep coming back to this hotel when I'm on business. The staff are amazing and it's in a great location as a 5 minute walk to the BTS station as well as a mall. The rooms are spacious and it's very quiet. I recommend it for those on business.
Wonderful afternoon Thai high-tea. Capture essence of Thai food culture and history. Excellent service with clear creativity. A journey through Thai history in which you will try various ingredients from different period of Thailand.
"As far as I can remember, nothing has changed since our last visit few years ago.   Even the potter are still as friendly n cheerful after working here for 15 years He can remember me!   We obtained a free upgrade to a better room.  We are only to check in at 2pm.   Gym looks the same.   Room looks the same, but pillow is too high for my liking. Air-con is cold but shower hot water temperature is hard to control.   Breakfast was not included, so we bought micro-waveable food from 7-11 as breakfast.   Room is clean n comforty n spacious. It is some 12mins slow walk from Saladaeng BTS."
"This is my third stay here which might suggest I have no complaints. Certainly, the location is great (I usually stay in Sathorn/Silom); rooms are spacious if dated; there‚Äôs an ok outdoor pool and a very decent gym/fitness centre.   But even though it is good value, there‚Äôs something missing, at least compared to other hotels with a similar price point and location (Eg: Bandarra Suites, literally across the road).  So what‚Äôs lacking? First, I‚Äôm ok with rooms that are a bit dated (I loved the Dusit Thani, sadly now in the process of being demolished). But SS seems to have a bit of a mould problem; in some rooms there‚Äôs no  power point anywhere near the bed to plug in your phone charger etc; and the toilet paper consists of annoying single squares -surely we‚Äôre adult enough to"
Very friendly staff which makes you feel very welcome. The suite was very big and clean but also a bit outdated. Price is very fair for what you get. Nice quite location with good breakfast and good roomservice.
While we think the taste for food here is slightly above average we found its presentation is stunning and food is refreshing as a masterpiece of Thai traditional food difficult to be found anywhere in Thailand. The ingredient used for their food presented in a series of set has been simply impressive and rewarding. Starting with the signature dish for each past King Rama I to Rama VI you will be educated and impressed for these wonderful Thai cuisine. Simply come for presentation is really worth your effort.
"Concierges spoke good English, got cabs for us, rooms were clean modern comfortable. We had a suite with full kitchen so it was fully equipped. Maids even though we didn‚Äôt want daily cleaning would always switch out towels & provide free bottled water & tea if asked. Nice corner suite so windows thru out suite. I will mention this we stayed on 6th fl. Always a musty smell getting off elevator, the master RR toilet seat broken so that every time you sat on it it felt tilted. My only downers otherwise I would return there again and would recommend to my friends, which I have going in December, but they already booked. Thanks"
Friendly staff and good location. Nice rooms and professional service. Located near Lumbini park and not far from Silom complex and metro station. I would book in the same hotel if I visit Bangkok again.
"The location. services, rooms, gym, pool are all top - we stayed for 5 nights first and then returned later for another 3 night as we felt absolutely perfect there. Already booked it again - looking forward to return. *****"
Great location and great hotel. Generous room size and good for couples and family. Only a few stops to the central malls. Close to 7/11 and food places. Good size room for working at desk and separate room for bedroom = happy times.
"We were very excited to be coming back to Siri Sathorn after 10 years. At one point it was my home in Bangkok. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. It‚Äôs getting tired and crying out for a refresh. It‚Äôs sparkle has gone and you no longer feel you are in a boutique oasis. On the good side, it‚Äôs in great location, the room sizes are generous and the staff are very friendly."
I stayed five days for biz trip and during the day I joined one hour personnel fitness training two times.  The session includes gym training and kick boxing. That was really Fanta and fun training to get rid of stress and jet leg.  Trainer and staff was very friendly and positiveüòä  Definitely will come back again and I can‚Äôt stay another hotels any more.  I visited BKK more than 50 times but this experience is the best.  Very nice amazing place krubüôè
"Firstly, i went to Siri Sathorn ( Friday beer party ) , i bought in advance promotion early bird THB 499 which was included free flow draught beer 2 hrs which is super value. Upon arrived the hotel, i was greeted by staffs with warm welcome and escort myself to the table, already reserved . I really appreciate for this as it shown to me that  they have attentive to well prepared everything prior my arrival in which i paid in advance. Dj foamie along with song 90th brought me back when i was secondary school, food also delicious. I didn't have much times to try another things. However i really love this hotel & can't wait to join their party and find tim to stay with them just one night. Siri Sathorn. Good job and look forward to see another party soonest"
We stayed for three nights and had  2-bedroom apartment in a smoke-free room. The hotel and room was very clean and the staff very friendly and attentive. Great breakfast and lunch buffet and also the room service menu is very comprehensive. We also had a couples massage at the hotel spa and can really recommend this. The only small complaint is the at the bedside lamp and phone next to my bed did not work. Would recommend and stay there again.
"I went for Beer Party, I's such an awesome nice for us. DJ was fantastic services along with my favorite music on Friday night. I decided to stay 1 night after party which was a lovey stay.   Hope to come back for Beer Party!"
"Very nice hotel. Good value for money. All you need to have a great Bangkok experience. Friendly staff, nice facilities, very nice breakfast and very conveniently located, near to restaurants and public transportation."
"have short stayed at Siri Sathorn for making the US visa. I was stunning with the size of room and cleanliness was first class, Room was so quiet even though located in CBD. Most importance reason to bring me back to this hotel is entire staffs which always attentive and serve me with smiling and treat me like a friend, In particular thanks to Mr. Bird and other door man, they were so nice and deliver service as Thai culture. To be honestly, i will return and recommend to everyone on this planet"

Nice hotel with nice staff. Comfortable beds. Clean room. Good facilities. We love the hotel. Walking distance to bts about 700meters from bts saladaeng. Near seven eleven and other food stalls in the street of silom road
"went for an excellent night out friday free flow beer party. well organised, nice 90 s music from pretty dj! dj fommie load of beers...continuing serve from servers look forward for next party...much more prepare myself!"
Very nice hotel. Attended the event at the hotel last week. It was superb! All staffs were nice and very service minded. Always smile on their faces. I wish I could attend more event at the hotel. It was a great place to relax and catch up with friend after a long working week. Keep it up guys!
"We had a very enjoyable evening at the Friday Beer party on the 31st of May at the Siri Sathron Hotel. Absolutely fantastic value for free flow beer and snacks accompanied by fantastic service from the booking process until the service on the night itself. Special thanks to K. Goodie who took fantastic care of us and a job well done for all his team, we will definitely return again - hopefully next time to stay at this outstanding property."
"Stay here every time I come to Bangkok. Nice & Clean room, good facilities, large gym and the pool is nice. Staffs are also friendly and very helpful. Recommend this place for those who are searching for place to stay around silom /sathorn area"
"Stayed 2 nights here for business trip in a designer one bedroom suite with separate bathroom, living room and also dining table completed with kitchen set, very useful for family traveller. If you looking for a quite hotel but locate in central area of the city and within walking distance to BTS station, this hotel is very recommended. But, if you like to shop and try a lot of local culinary just next to your hotel, than you have to find another place. Breakfast was delicious, tough the choice was not very wide. For the price you pay it is worth it."
It's oh so quiet. This is the sentence to appreciate them. The hotel is located in center area of Bangkok city but their selected material make us isolate from chaos. We could spend time in the hotel all day because they have swimming pool and enjoy their wonderful meal.
"Very comfortable accommodation within walking distance to Sala Dang and Silom stations. The rooms are large with good appointments, they are well serviced and very clean. The room pricing is at a medium to high rate, the accommodation is value for money although a luxury if your on a budget."
"the room was perfect! nothing to complain about except the pillows were too thick. we didn't use the pillows at all (no worries we were comfortable without them). The staff were lovely. Also the location is great as it's close to subway, market(for street food lovers) and embassies (we had things to get done at Australia embassy and it didn't take long to get there by walking)."
"I was 2 night at siri hotel sathorn bkk. Graet location, very cozy room and big suit,the stuff is wonderful. My flight was at night and i ask if i can shower before the flight and there was no problem. Will back again."
"Nice authentic Thai food ‚ÄúKhao chae‚Äù  Such a splendid dish to cool yourself from the heat of Bangkok. It totally differs from Khao Chae I ever had in my whole life. Can feel the delicacy of each element of it, plus the narration of Pic, the chef, is informative and make the dish more meaningful."
"Cleanliness is what I concern. I have to say that I was highly impressed with the wide space and the comfort of our bed in the clean bedroom! It only means to us that the staffs really care for the guests.  Hotel is well accessible. Great restaurants are just in walking distance. Actually the hotel has a shuttle bus service to drop off at nearby entertaining surroundings! Literally, you can also easily just walk for about five minutes to jump in BTS and MRT (their names of train services) to avoid traffic. Bangkok seems a lot more convenient with hotel facilities!  The breakfast is included in our room and I could not recommend it enough. The variety and quality will surprise you the best you could imagine with the price you pay!  What also makes this hotel different is their"
"Large room, good staff, good location. Stayed one night and got a large room with a view. Staff was very helpful. Location also good. Parking was also secure and safe. All in all a fine hotel and we would like to come back."
