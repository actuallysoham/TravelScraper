"One of the best hotel in city centre, The room was so big and clean , breakfast also nice. Best thing about this hotel is the location only less than 5 minutes to Ratchathewi Bts station. Would recommend anyone to come stay here , you won‚Äôt regret it."
I stayed here for a month. All staff are very nice. Front Desk is always there to help you. They're enthusiastic for their work. -nice and fast service-. If you lack anything just dial to the front desk and maid will arrange for you as well. All staff here are good but K'Ta and K'Duean are outstanding. If I have to get back to bkk I will stay here again for sure.
I really enjoy stayed in hotel. It located in the central location which is very near sky train minimart. All the staff espectially Mr. Benz is very kind and friendly. The room is clean and cozy. I would like to come here agin in the future
"Nice staff, great and fast service. The room was clean and tidy. We booked for the stand room but got an upgrade to superior. We were very happy. The check in and out was fast and no fussy. Definitely will book again when we are in town."
"I have stayed at this hotel 3 times already. The room is nice, clean and big. Especially the suite is very cheap and big for family traveler you got more space than deleux or superior. The staffs are 100/100. They nice friendly and sincere. Especially the front desk. I shall visit again  Benz"
"I have stayed this hotel several times. Location is good in center of Bangkok. Value for money. I always appreciate a reception staff K.A. He always be enthusiastic to work. Actaully all staffs are ready to help, but he is outstanding."

Closed to BTS, friendly staff from Front desk till Housekeeping and especially from the Coffee Shop staff, Restaurant manager Khun Ae and her fellow staff Mark, Aum, Mony, Gift and Dome provided a good service both breakfast and dinner. Beside that, pool on 8th floor is good for swimming and relax. Highly recommended! My friend and I planned to come here twice a month. Good job!"
"We stayed in the deluxe suite room, the room has a big bedroom and a spacious living room, and also a balcony where we could hang our laundry after we traveled for a week in Thai. The receptionist staff is friendly and every time they give me a warm greeting."
"‚ÄúThe hotel was so cheap due to the epidemic. When compare with amount that I pay the facility and service is so high. The staff Khun Benz,Khun A,KhunYam is so good and is very helpful for me the room is so amazing. I‚Äôm really sure that the price now you should book because cannot find any good hotel like this in cheapest price like this. ‚Äù"
Great hotel with friendly staffs and especially receptionist (Benz). I keep returning to Evergreen hotel every month. The room is clean and comfortable. Gym and swimming pool are huge. I really enjoyed staying there.
"Staying with new brand of hotel is not too bad . Firstly when I checked in room is not clean as am I expected they have some hair on slipper. Anyway, thank you for early room check in. After I back hotel on evening electric were cut off in my room. Service is a bit long to fix it and finally, I gonna move the room haha. A new room in nice and clean. Breakfast is meet standard not wow or variety as current situation, I accept it. Lastly, thank you all staff to taking care and I hope that my review can be useful for all guys . If you seek a hotel just a short trip this is one of choice üëçüèª"
Very friendly and helpful receptionist staff especially the man incharge of the check in process. Room is clean and big. Air con in masterbedroom is not functioning well but in living room one is cool. Just 5 min walk to BTS.
"The holiday is wonderful.  Worth a hotel stay  The rooms are clean and beautifully decorated, the hotel is adjacent to the BTS, convenient for traveling.  Very good service staff, especially Khun Fon help me everything when check in .Thank you, come back soon. ‡∏ù‡∏ô"
"By far the most friendly, service oriented place with ultra clean rooms, an amazing breakfast buffet and a gym unlike any other hotel.. it's a real gym!  The staff here is second to none. Benz,Fov & Nook at the front desk took care of my every need and always greeted me with a warm smile and their English is perfect  And the gentleman that works in the gym named To is a also a personal trainer who is studying fitness science at a 4 year university  Thank you and I will return  Chok Dee,  HOSTEL YOGI  IG: @HOSTELYOGI  FB: HOSTELYOGI JULIAN  YOUTUBE: MOTORCYCLE YOGI"
"I recently spent every month at the Evergreen Place and were very pleased with the service provided. One of the thing that i am most impressed is the staff P, NOOK üë©üèª who is helping at the entrance. So definitely the best services I have experienced so far.  Good location as very near the skytrain and the malls at walking distance. The room cleaning service was great and the room was very clean. i would really recommend this hotel for everyone!!"
"It‚Äôs my first time here at Evergreen. And of course this won‚Äôt be my last time. The first impression occurred when I did the booking via FB. The more impression happened on the dates of my checkin, staying, and checkout. The staff are badly nice. The room is absolutely cozy. The place itself is located in the heart of BKK and only a-minute walk to BTS. That‚Äôs terrific for night life lovers, especially during this festive season. Aside from these, buffet lines are wonderful with a variety of food that you may wish to have a larger room in your stomach to place them all. I‚Äôll see you next time for sure Evergreen place and Khun Nook when I‚Äôm in BKKüíï"
"I stayed at Evergreen Place for five nights.  The room was very nice.  big and clean.  Fantastic breakfast in the morning: a really rich buffet to choose from.  The staff have always been very nice and helpful.  I also liked the location, close to the subway and shopping centers."
"Friendly and comfortable to live, although the room decoration too old for now. I Can guarantee you must love this place if you love friendly,cozy,great services, worth price and delicious food. So if you looking for some place where to rest in Bangkok you can choose this now !!"
"The place is clean and very convenient, just few meters from BTS. Gym, breakfast, swimming pool excellent. I strongly recommend this hitel. K Fon andvK A are always so kind and helpful, and communicating in English with them very easy."
"Unbeatable value for money, excellent hotel with nice rooms, beautiful swimming pool and gym, great location. The staff is very good and attentive. I will for sure use it again. Definitely highly recommended."
"First of all, great location! Located right next to Ratchathewi BTS, you can access all major shopping areas from this hotel. All staffs speak flawless English and they were all very helpful. Mr. A in particular was very welcoming to us. He upgraded our room for free and for that I will always remain truly grateful. Hotel itself is very clean and it has all the amenities required for a comfortable  stay. I look forward to visiting this property soon in the near future. Cheers!"
"Good place, service and nice staffs. Khun A and Khun Jade provide any convenience and comfort for my whole staying time.Hotel location is vary easy to go to other place in town. There are gym and outdoor pool which you can relax, readidg or watching sunset and disappear behide buildins in the downtown. Breakfast is also great."
"The staffs are very nice and professional service especially Khun Toom my dear manager. I arrived in the early morning before the check in time, she acknowledged my advance request and prepared all check in documents and have my rest that‚Äôs why I frequently came back to stay when went to Bangkok"
"I really appreciated Khun A and Khun Yam they‚Äôre help me a lot, I couldn‚Äôt find my booking number but Khun Yam who taking are reservation officer she help me until check in dat e! I will back to your hotel again!!"
"I have made multiple stays at Evergreen and I keep coming back. The hotel has a central location, is reasonably priced, and the rooms are well-maintained.  What is most important to me, however, is the high level of service, from security to housekeeping to the front desk. Benz, Jammy, and Nokky were all particularly helpful in making sure that everything worked well throughout my stay. Staff were friendly and professional throughout my time, and I will definitely choose Evergreen again in the future."
"Evergreen is situated at the centre of all my fave foodie finds. Just a walk away from paragon, central, Ari neighbourhood, the bts, shopping! We had a funny smell in our bathroom our first couple of days but they were kind enough to transfer us to a more comfortable space. They are also eco conscious and promote it by giving insentives to their clients. Everyone in the staff really paid attention to detail--from my little quirks at breakkie all prepped to my post gym sauna settings! They made us feel right at home. There is also an adequate gym for a week's stay complete with saunas and steam rooms. We definitely want to stay here next time around.  My only comment has to be breakfast. I wish they had more whole foods breads like the first couple days of our stay and more vegan"
"My first Stay here at Evergreen was more that I expected. Check in was very quick. The receptionist was so nice and explained to me everything before I went up to my room. Would definitely recommend this place, because it‚Äôs great location and friendly staff."
Evergreen place with current covid-19 problem all around the world¬† lowere its price like any other existing hotels in Bangkok but after checking in within few hrs notification receptionist Aom was so much helpful regarding simplicity and quickness. She went beyond helping by re checking our extra stay while other two incompetent (day shift) receptionist couldn't formulate how to check if our late check-out was even possible or trying to charge more than minimum.  Miss Aom was so much helpful in regards to checking to make sure we had great stay and made our booking easy.¬† Thank you Aom for taking care of us. We will be back for your tremendous support.
"This is our second time staying here, we first stayed for 5 weeks in June 2020 and now a 4 night stay in Sept 2020.  Our room was on the 17th floor (same room both times) with a great city view. We had a large smart TV, fridge and the bathroom had an amazing shower!! The best thing about the room is the bed!! Without a doubt the comfiest bed I've ever slept on, and with very cozy sheets. Aircon works a treat and you can make your room as cold as you would like.  The hotels buffet breakfast is great and has plenty of choice including freshly made omlettes and fried eggs. A few different pastries to choose from too, if you have a sweet tooth like me!   The hotel is located down a side street, close to a massage shop, 7/11 and countless street food restaurants that are really good."
"My three night trip was more than what I expected.  Initially the dark entrance alley gave me a second thought, but when we got to the doorstep, It was all the below:  Friendly staffs, super helpful and bilingual. Convenient and clean rooms. Great toilet view, and of course, easy to travel around the heart of bangkok as it is right next to bus/taxi stops and the BTS."
"Excellent location! The hotel is near the skytrain and only walking distance from shopping malls as well. The staffs were incredibly friendly and helpful special mention to Mr. Sein from front desk. We booked a standard room but they gave us a superior room ,which is really nice. Upon entering the hotel, you will be welcomed and assisted by the room boy. The housekeepers are very friendly and all smiles when you bump into them. We had a smooth check in and checkout process. We will surely come back!"
"I have been here for several times but the last time would be the very last time to stay with them.  I sent the official complaint and feedback by e-mail 4 days ago but there is no proper apology or any reply so I am leaving this review here.  There were 2 facility problems while I stayed there with my friend.  (1) AC did not work at night In the day time when I checked in, it seems AC had working though it was weak. But after we came back from outside about 10pm, I felt AC did not work well. And we had uncomfortable night to sleep.  Could hardly sleep. When I opened the window at 5am, I noticed It was hotter in the room than outside in Bangkok...  (2) Window lock was out of order I stayed at 15th floor room, there was a window can be open but can not be locked. The room is"
"Having stayed at Evergreen Place Siam for several times, I and my close friend, decided that this is a go-to when we want to privately have our fun nights together. Conveniently located in the middle of Bangkok, every kind of delicious Thai and international foods is just around the corner! The service is also user-oriented with all kinds of facilities such as fitness, steam, and sauna. Plus, they always offer a huge number of promotions fitting your budget!"
"I just wanted to say a big thank you to ICE, the duty manager for looking after us. A fantastic, friendly and super helpful guy who made sure that myself and my new husband had a wonderful stay! Facilities are great, food is fabulous, beds are sooooooo comfortable. Love the showers, love the gym, pool, steam room and sauna. We were only supposed to be here a few days but ended up staying pretty much the whole 3 weeks. Whenever we visit Thailand again, we'll be sure to come back. Thank you again Ice and the whole team."
"Everything is clean. The bed is a little hard for me. Nice pool, was really beautiful at sunset. Ice at the front desk has been very helpful in extending my stay.  I am working out airport transfer issue, hotels.com said it was included."
"The rooms here are incredible - basically serviced apartments. Evergreen has every facility you could want - gym, pool, really good buffet breakfast. The views from every room are superb and the location, down a quiet alley, is walking distance to MRT and all the big shopping malls. But what made this hotel so special is the staff - from the concierge to the lovely housekeepers, restaurant and gym. I was at all times treated with grace and respect. Every time I went in or out everyone said hello, waved or gave a Wai. Special mention to the Reception staff, especially Fon and Ice. They were always busy but always smiling and could not do enough to make my stay so enjoyable. The best place I have stayed in Bangkok in 20 years. Thank you to everyone. Mr David (1502)"
"After staying at this hotel a month ago, we chose to return for another week while we awaited our flight home to NZ. The reception  staff (including Ice), concierge, 8th floor restaurant were all very friendly and helpful (well above the high level of service we have experienced in Thailand). The huge variety of breakfast dishes were fresh, delicious and filling. The swimming pool was ultra convenient when we felt like a quick dip. Big thank you to the gym staff that returned an item of clothing that blew off our balcony. Such a lovely hotel - we will certainly return for a third stay when we stay in Bangkok (again)."
"this place is absolutely great, we enjoyed our stay sooooo much. The room is clean and large. TV and air con work fine and staff very kind. K. A and Ice at the reception are friendly and their English is excellent. We will definitely come back again."
"The service in general is very friendly and efficient, they go out of their way, to please customers. The ""dynamic duo"" at the front desk Krung(Mr) A and Krung Ice gives an extra plus with their helpfulness and good knowledge of English and in Ice's case: German.The ladies who work there, are also very nice. The swimming pool is one of the highlights. The rooms are comfortable and are keep in good shape. Juan Simon, New York City."
"I booked for 5 days and stayed for a month. The location is perfect. It's tucked down an alley entrance away from Phraya Thai Road and just a short walk to MBK Center and Siam Paragon or a 2 minute walk to Ratchathewi BTS Station.  The rooms are spacious, comfortable, well lit. The bed is very nice, firm, but soft. There is a refrigerator in the room as well as kettle, instant coffee, tea, etc. Amenities are great with nice soap and shampoos (lemongrass).  The breakfast is adequate and filling, coffee is fresh, and the kitchen will cook eggs to order, just ask the amazing dining staff. The gym and swimming pool are well equipped and there are locker rooms for changing. The pool is 1 meter to 1.8 meters deep and very large. There is also a laundromat with several washers if you"
"A great hotel. Check in was smooth, friendly and efficient. Tbe room was spacious and clean. The location was perfect for our plans in the city.  The breakfast selection was good, with a range of options available."
"Wonderful friendly staff in every department we encountered both day and night shifts.  They were helpful from giving recommendations, being clean and attentive in the gym and responding to some minor issues in the room that was resolved quickly.  Thank you!"
"I stayed at Evergreen for two weeks. The hotel is in a convenient location next to the BTS and the rooms are spacious. The best part of my stay was the staff. Whenever I needed assistance, the front desk (especially Ice) responded promptly. I had full confidence that whatever question or issue arose, that the staff would be able to help. I will definitely book again on future trips to Bangkok."
It was really an amazing experience at this Hotel. All of the Staff was very helpful and attentive. Every time when I pass the Reception came a ‚ÄûSwassdee Ka/krub‚Äú from staff. The breakfast was also great! Would definitely staying there again!
Feel‚Äã like‚Äã home‚Äã during stay.‚Äã All‚Äã Hotel‚Äã staffs are‚Äã very‚Äã polite‚Äã with‚Äã service‚Äã mind.‚Äã The‚Äã room‚Äã and‚Äã properties‚Äã of‚Äã Hotel‚Äã are‚Äã in‚Äã good‚Äã condition.‚Äã The‚Äã fitness‚Äã and‚Äã swim pool are‚Äã clean.‚Äã The‚Äã restaurant‚Äã at‚Äã 8th floor is‚Äã clean‚Äãand‚Äã comfort.
"Staying here for two months. Very convenient location with choice restaurants, coffee shops,western restaurants. Monorail one block away. Malls 10 minutes walk. All staff st the hotel are very friendly, helpful and  accommodative. We feel very much at home with many English news channels, use of pool, fitness and sauna facilities. Highly recommend the hotel."
"Me and my 19 friends went to stay at Evergreen Place for two nights and the bellboy guy named Sam really stood out! He was super friendly, happy, helpful with organising our many bags and getting us taxis etc. A guy like this deserves a promotion for sure! The hotel itself is great too! Price worthy,amazing location and brekkie is good. Recommended!"
"I was stranded in Bangkok for over a month as my airline wasn't flying during the covid-19 pandemic. I was fortunate to to find the Evergreen Place Hotel. Excellent location in central Bangkok; 3 minute walk to BTS, ten minute walk to MBK, Siam Paragon, Hard Rock Cafe, Jim Thompson House, etc.  The service at the Evergreen is exceptional for a hotel rated as 3 stars. Everyone here is very service minded.  It seems unfair to point anyone out but Ae in the restaurant and Nice in the fitness center were exceptional.  Warm, friendly smile every day. But everyone is great from the door men to the front desk to the restaurant staff to the housekeeping staff. Even the owner, who occasionally has breakfast in the restaurant, is warm and friendly.  Excellent fitness center. Great"
"Hotel is clean. Staff is nice. Housekeeping services  good.  This place is perfect if you are a family, or even a solo traveller looking for a good nights rest. It is located near Siam shopping district, and has many street food vendors if your stomach is strong!  The staff are super friendly and helpful, especially Mr. SAM. Who is always attentative and can help answer all your inquiries and need. Definitely stay here."
The room is simple but very clean and comfy. All staffs are very friendly since front desk through restaurant crew.  The location is a walking distance from BTS Ratchatewi. Just few minutes walk to the hotel.  Service is also very good. I came early but a front desk staff offered me to make early-check in  Will re-visit this place for sure!
"we stayed at evergreen our first night in Bangkok. This is not the fanciest place but it had what we needed for our family. we had a 2 bedroom suite with a kitchenette and livingroom. it was quiet enough for us to get over our jet lag. The receptionist were super friendly and helpful.  if you have the option to have breakfast included....DO IT! The food is so delicious and something for everyone.  You can walk right out front and get a foot massage or hit up the seven eleven for snack or check out the food vendors out front. my impression  was New York city on steriods...it was great! if you need a taxi, the concierge will get you one. need to book a tour? there's someone for that too. we booked a tour and had the best day and saw the grand palace, river tour and so much more."
"Great location! Walking distance to Siam Discovery, MBK etc - also close to BTS. You'll find a 7/11 right outside the alley. Excellent service provided by one of the receptionist, a thai woman we didn't get the name of - she was kind and helpful! And thanks for the upgrade! :)  + The room is fresh, modern with comfy beds and slippers. + Bathroom, spacious I really liked it! + The gym was big, had a lot of equipments and they provided towels and water. + The pool, amazing. + When you save on towels/sheets they'll provide a coupon with free ice cream and popcorn at the pool! + Location is just SUPER, especially if you want to be close to Siam.  - Only two elevators for so many rooms and floor? A lot of waiting. - Our room was very nice, however too little space for baggage etc,"
My family and friends had a great stay in Evergreen Hotel. The staff were very helpful and polite. The entire place is so clean. Must visit! Location is great cos it‚Äôs nearby the malls. I will definitely come back here.
"I felt like it was my home in a different place. I felt at ease. The location was perfect. No wonder the hotel was always fully booked regardless of the season. It was the center of everything and everything was accessible. Everything about the description and photos were 101% true and not only that, the staff was amazing. Special mention to Sein for being a superstar! For taking care of me and my Family's needs and for having initiative. Looking forward to going back here for sure!"
"I have returned to this property on more than one occasion. I love the location, close to the BTS, MBK and Siam. The staff are exceptional. A hout out to the duuty manager Khun A and the front desk staff Khun Aom and Khun Sein. They went above and beyond to make me comfortable. I would highly recommend this place to travellers!"
Stayed for a couple of nights. Everything was well taken care of and staff was super friendly. Especially Next from the front desk was very lovely and helpful. Great location and nice facilities.  Would stay again
"charged 1000 baht (30 EUR) per night for a foldable bed for my kid, and my reservation was clearly for 2 adults and 2 children. I think the hotel allocates small rooms at cheaper prices than other hotels nearby and then charges extra for the bed that you need."
"This is a nice hotel and we were in a double room with kitchen on the 17th floor. It was quite and the city view was amazing. From our room we can see the metro rail passing by. The metro station was also very nearby, 5 mins walk. The amenities in the shower were of good quality. The sauna and the gym were good as well. The breakfast was below average."
"Best bed I slept in after 45 years of business travel. Good location right near the BTS skytrain station. Excellent staff, buffet breakfast. Local restaurants, street food and shopping malls. Netflix on TV"
"We totally loved our apartment 1703 with a fantastic view that allows you to enjoy the sunrise over Bangkok skyline!  The hotel is luxurious, the breakfast buffet is just like a dream for a foodie ‚Äì so many things to try, plenty of fresh exotic fruits, delicious local dishes and the good old European options... The pool is a bit cold, but the gym is v very nice! The staff is polite and extremely helpful. The transfer to the airport is a bit pricy, but that‚Äôs not exactly related to the hotel. Our wonderful apartment consisted of two rooms, and it was so comfortable, at first we didn‚Äôt want to go out at all)) Though we did in the end, because the hotel has a perfect location for exploring Bangkok - walkable distance to all the best malls like The Platinum Fashion Mall. The tube"
Hey Evergreen staff ‚ò∫ Just want to say thank you for a very nice stay. I have never gotten so good service before. Your crew is professional but are still able to laugh with the customers. Last night I went down to order a taxi to driver me to the DMK airport for today. I was standing there for maybe 1 hour or so just talking to Sein and Next. We laughed and laughed and had a very great time. I think this is the best you can give a customer. Next has only been working for you for 2 or 3 months but she is really competent and has a unique way to make a guest feel welcome. You should cherish her because she will grow and only become better. She's one of a kind.  Sein help me to check in when I came 5am in the morning. He had a big smile and is very friendly and he really tried of
"I enjoyed staying in this well-located and friendly hotel. I was quite surprised not to find a desk in the room, but the staff provided one immediately after my request. The bathroom seemed to be newly renovated and was nice. The location was great, tucked away from the main road (though it could be better signposted) with easy access to BTS and the boat services - the best way of getting around. Many thanks to the friendly and efficient staff!"
"Chose this hotel as it‚Äôs a 5 min walk from our son‚Äôs condo and as we were staying 14 nights it proved to be easy walking distance from BTS, Siam and Platinum district (from where we usually stay).  However, we booked a superior room which was adequate for a few nights but no where to store clothes ie no wardrobe space if you are staying longer.  Bathroom was a good size but towels were well worn and although clean need replacing soon room had a nice large bed and excellent bed linen and very comfortable with efficient a/c.  Lacking a well placed sockets in fact the only one we could use was under to shelf so had to take the kettle into the bathroom (only twice did housekeeping replenish 2 tea bags). Room was clean but in sadly need of refurbishment and balcony needs a deep"
"We booked 2 deluxe room and was upgraded to a 2-room suite which was good for us. As with our numerous stay in this hotel over the past few years, it was pleasant and when without any issue. Nevertheless, we notice that ever since UHG took over the hotel management services, the service provided by the front desk was less personal. Moreover, we did not see any of the long-serving staff anymore."
"We passed the hotel without seeing it, as it turned out the entrance is in a small alley, hidden a bit. Or you can pass through a coffeeshop, and an officebuilding. Personnel was smiley but our room was not ready, ofcourse it was 13.00 h so no problem. We returned after 2 hours and found a clean and comfortable room, dated and chipped but with a bathtub and an opening window. The pool was not spectacular and really cold, but big enough and there where some sunbeds. while yhe location is good we will try another hotel for this price next time."
"Excellent hotel with excellent location located at the city, extremely clean & comfortable . Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the friendly reception and hotel supervisor SEIN, he makes our trip more interesting with his advices & tips about the city. Supermarket ,shops,restaurants, 7/11 are within walking distance plus variants of street foods are nearby. Very near to MBK Center, Siam Paragon and BTS. Would definetely recommend this hotel to everybody! It's a true sample of excellent hospitality. Thank you again Sein for going that extra mile to give good customer service for your guests! God Bless!"
"We booked for the family room with a balcony.  The room was pretty big and had two bathrooms and a kitchen which was nice. The balcony, which was our main reason for booking, was impossible to sit in. They put no less then 5 condensers in it, so it‚Äôs hot chocking air on you face and always very noisy. The staff response for that was that ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a common thing in every hotel‚Äù. WTF? No costumer service awareness. Breakfast is somewhat between average to poor, pool is poor, looks much better in photos. Gym‚Äôs lousy.  Will not recommend."
Hotels in popular destinations Shopping for hotels? You‚Äôre in the right place.  Thank you staff are helpful and recommended  ( AEY ) good service the room is very clean and clear  Love swimming pool so I‚Äôm very happy to stay
"Everyone at the hotel is welcoming & lovely, service is always with a smile which makes the world of difference to any stay. The hotel has a ‚Äúgo green‚Äù policy which rewards guests for doing their part in saving the environment. We were given free ice cream and popcorn for opting out of the bed making service.. hopefully other hotels will follow. City view room, comfy bed, powerful air con, pool is a bonus! Will stay again"
"We stayed here after being at an awful hotel (D&D Inn) we came here and couldn‚Äôt be happier. The reception team were amazing, so lovely and helpful. We had breakfast included which was soooo good! Choice from cereal/toast/Thai food/fruit/juices etc. The rooms were spotless and you get a treat if you ask for you bedding not to be changed, what more could you ask for. Awesome place, you feel like you are out of the city. Also very close to the sky train"
"For those of you who have taken the airport link train from suvarnabhumi airport can get off at the last stop which is Phaya thai ... walk within the station to get the BTS (sky train) to Rathchathewi BTS (only one stop) and walk 300 m to get to the hotel. Like this specially for the location. Also walking distance from the Siam boat station. Located close to lot of eateries. Has a massage place, 7/11 store and lot of street food being sold right outside.   Rooms are tiny but pretty well equipped.  Staff is friendly, although there is some language difficulty."
"The Evergreen Place Siam in Bangkok was a neat and tidy hotel with friendly staff. The room was quite big and had a small fridge, microwave, kettle, and cook top, the decor was a little dated but it was fine.   Location: The MBK Centre was a 10 min walk away, and the hotel is very close to the Ratchathewi Station, about 1 min walk. There is an awesome dining precinct right across the road called Coco Walk with several great, affordable Thai restaurants and bars. I recommend one in there called Thai Town, the food was excellent and drinks were strong. As it's a big main road, it's best to go to the Ratchathewi station, go up the big stairs, across, and down the stairs on the other side, in order to cross the road. There is a Massage place next to the hotel driveway which does"
"This hotel has a great location, close as it is to the airport, but still down town. It‚Äôs a sky train station very near by (3 minutes walk), fab‚Äô shopping in the hood and great, short walks takes you to amongst (other destinations), the Jim Thompson House. Rooms are huge enough, bathroom efficient, swimming pool (at the 8th floor) cool enough and breakfast totally ok. Service is superb! Price wise ok too! In other words: Convenient for a stop over!"
