"Everything was great! The room, the food, the facilities and the service. The kids really enjoyed the stay and already ask when they can go back for another stay. The staycation promotion really worth the money with 2,500THB voucher to use."
"So many shortcomings for a so-called ‚Äú5-star‚Äù hotel...  First off, the staff who brought our bags in the room almost threw our luggage in the room, and it hit the wardrobe. Then there‚Äôs barely any useful amenities...  Boat shuttles were closed. No kids club. Tiny fitness club. Tiny swimming pool. Not even a shuttle car service to Icon Siam. Lattes or iced coffee wasn‚Äôt even included in the breakfast. We had to pay an additional charge...  Completely subpar compared to many many real 5 star hotels in Thailand"
Everything was excellent the staff was amazing and the location was the best. Excellent Excellent Excellent Everything was excellent the staff was amazing and the location was the best Excellent Excellent
"The room has nice view to see the river. Anyway, some servocr need to be improve like staff interaction with guest, asking for ice mostly luxury and upscale hotel not charge for this but this hotel charge to customer."
"We stayed in the Family Suite room on the 29th floor. It was too bad that we got the city view room might be because we were not Hilton Honor member.  The check in staff was very polite and we checked in for 3 rooms for the whole family. All rooms were clean but the decorations in the room were getting a bit old.   All breakfast buffets were great but we recommend you to sit outside to get the riverview in the morning. It was quite nice.  The hotel locates 50 meters (next to) IconSiam but the department store seems too bit and have nothing to buy except luxury brands.  We took the dinner on the boat ride one night, which was outstanding because there were not too many people due to COVID-19 and we also sat outside to enjoy the weather, views and temples along the way."
"Second time but only 1 night so sad, haha  room is nice as I expected. Executive lounge is very busy as many people staycation during this period. Anyway service is meet to standard. Good job everyone! üëçüèªüëçüèª"
"The attention to guest is so poor that they just want to end the request as soon as possible ie. When I call 0 they try to transfer somewhere else without listen to me carefully.  The room is clean but the equipment is old (the shower feels crappy). The tub is okay.  Also, beware of the charge. They charge for cutlery at 60 baht for the in-room culrty."
"The hotel is located on good location on Bangkok west, closed to one of the biggest mall in Bangkok. Also, the staff is very nice and friendly. One more important thing during new normal the cleanliness of the hotel is very good. You can tell it safe here in the hotel."
"I stayed 2 times in the executive room at the same time. The first time was the 27th floor and the second was the 26th floor.   The room: Chao Phraya River view is very beautiful. Sunset photography in the evening is spectacular. The room is beautifully decorated. Full amenities such as a sofa to sit and watch the river view, a luxurious Jacuzzi to soak in. In addition, the bathroom is separated between the shower zone and the toilet zone. The minibar is very affordable if compared to other hotels.  Food: The foods we ordered for In-room dining were delicious Tom Yum Goong and steamed salmon with curry paste. I can sit and eat in my room and enjoy the view of the river. Breakfast was ok but not excellent. The cakes and coffee at the Coffee shop on the 1st floor are averages."
"Poor front service. I booked the hotel with 2500THB hotel credit. There's no information provided at all upon checking, so I thought it will be used while we check out. On the check out date the front gave us the coupon that expired on the check out date and charges room service normally. so we have to spend the coupon on the bakery shoo which is the only shop available in the hotel. It is normal to make mistake but the front office does not show any responsibility for their mistake for not giving us the coupon upon checking in, that's the reason that we'll never be back there again.   The service quite poor compare to the hotel in the same area, no greetings, no assisting, even the luggage was drop at the door, no turn down. There's 60 THB charges for an ice bucket or any tray"
"I'm not sure why I'm writing this review as the management don't respond and I'll be repeating problems that many other guests have mentioned before, but here goes. The positives first. I took a staycation in a panoramic suite that had been recently renovated and was absolutely stunning; much more glamourous and interesting than it looks in the photos. The lounge was open and we enjoyed sandwiches and cakes for afternoon tea, and cheese, fried rice, (awful) tempura vegetables, and quite a lot of booze during the evening. It was my partner's birthday so the hotel gave us a cake and the lounge staff organised a 3pm check out, both of which were amazing- thank you! Why only 4.2 stars? The hotel charges a ""tray charge"" of THB60 to bring ice to your room. This is so nasty and is a"
"Great experience to celebrate Birthday with my family here, splendid view from the high floor room ... you can see the curves of Chao Praya River with nightlife boats ...color of Bangkok skyscrapers far away on the right and the golden light of beautiful church on the left ... last but most important the huge department store ""The Icon Siam"" for my wife .. Wow !!"
"Location nearly IconSiam, can walk for 3min Big room/ Clean / good service Due to situation of COVID-19, price was reduce and too much Crowded people, still good service and clean. Better to stay here than service apartment."
Good river view from the room. Convenience because near Iconsiam shopping  mall. Service was ok. Extra charge for using hotel credit which different price from Pay normal. Extra charge for bowl set.....
Located on the edge of Chao Praya river. Very pleasant hotel. Very efficient welcome and service. Comfortable and spacious rooms. Very pleasant breakfast buffet by the river. Magical roof top for a drink with a breathtaking view of Bangkok.
Hotel is very nice river view. Service is excellent and helpful from staff. Food is good taste and room is comfortable stay. Promotion and package of this hotel are attractive to booking and hope to return again.
We here for one night with the best memories here actually I been there many times but my family here for the first time they enjoyed to stay here with clean stay and professional service especially Khun Saiparn she is executive lounge staff. Highly recommended here
"With my Family, we visited Millennium Hilton Bangkok on Chinese New Year. The hotel was crowned, however the check in process is very fast. Currently there are renovation in Lobby floor, swimming pool, and Executive lounge  which expected to completed all by May 21.   The Room is good as Hilton standards, with River view.  The Executive Lounge service was moved to The Lantern at Lobby floor, which is very crowned and no privacy, however the staffs at lounge are very kind and helpful."
"We spend a two-nights staycation over a weekend.  Check-in was super busy on Saturday but I still got a very friendly service and recognition of my Diamond status.  We were upgraded to a beautiful Panoramic Executive Suite (#2802). The suites are showing their age although this room clearly was upgraded since our last stay about 3 1/2 years ago. We love the view from the room, partly over the beautiful Chao Praya River and the surrounding area.  The Executive Lounge was unfortunately closed due to renovation works so the experience was shifted to a cafe next to the reception area. A bit busy for my taste but the spread was acceptable given the current situation. Breakfast was good although the line on Sunday morning looked like a bad day at immigration.  What we did not"
"I stayed at this hotel with my friends. Ms.Noodle kindly checked us in and out. She is beautiful and she always smiled and answered my questions about the diamond member benefits to make sure. When I called that hotel a few days before I checked in, the telephone receiver told me that 3 people could access the lounge if I put the quantity of 3 on reservation. However, it seemed to be wrong. I was actually ok then. What I was a bit dissatisfied was some of the guests didn‚Äôt wear the plastic disposable gloves when they picked up some food at the executive lounge. And the lounge staffs didn‚Äôt pay attention to that situation. This is just the feedback. Anyway, Ms. Noodle checked us in and out. Overall, I was satisfied with my stay. Looking forward to staying there again soon."
"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights from 12-14 feb. 2022. General service was fine.  On Saturday i went out from the hotel and come back by afternoon. The thing is my keycard cant access to the evalator! The reception said my card was registered just only for 1 night! My booking was 2 nights and repeat with reception when i check-in.   In the evening i had buffet dinner at hotel, food was ok, not so much choice, but what is bothering me is some staff at food station they are talking each other with some swearword, there are still some customer at the restaurant, never expected i will heard that from 5 hotel. Also never sit outside next to the river again, been bite alot by mosquito.  On my last day, my bf wanted to surprise me by sending a bouquet of flower for me to my room but"
Nice location and easy access to Iconsiam. Room is comfort and clean.Thank you so much to Khun Ning and Khun Nuna who check in us on the first day for warm welcome and kindness for room upgrades. Pool at 4 floor is awesome. See you again.
"I would like to give a compliment  and thanks to Khun Best ( front desk) and all front desk team for providing a very wonderful service during my stay for 2 nights. All staff are friendly,helpful  and have a personal touch. Breakfast was alternative and varieties. Room with a river view was amazing and cleanliness up to standard . ICON shopping mall is near the hotel which makes it more convenient for living.  This hotel is a good choice for relaxing and taking a vacation in Bangkok."
"Hotel was offering a great deal so we thought take advantage of the offer and come in to town and stay at a hotel near to the Icon Siam. Pre booking, Pre arrival, Check-in was great, hotel lacked a bit of atmosphere due to low occupancy, (Covid) Incredible view of the river, room and hotel very clean and spacious."
"For sure this hotel need a lot of improvements. Although the lobby looks good but there are many details that i think should be improved from the hotel  1. The shuttle boat not on serviced, as a five star hotel located by the River i believe its essential to keep this service to attract more people and compete with other hotels  2. The pool is lack of maintenance, many dirty mark and also u can find some dry bird dirt on the mattress   3. It is the smallest 5 star room i ever had. Its like holiday inn level (you can even see the fridge facing you everytime wake up in the morning)  4. The cleaning service is not the best for 5 star hotel. I found 2 pcs of hair on my sink and shower when i just came  5. The bathtub is stucked cannot drain the water after taking bath  6. I was"
"The overall experience in this hotel was excellent. We had a very nice time here. We had a panoramic view from the room and it was amazing, with a beautiful scene of the skyline and the river. The lounge was exceptional with tasty treats and drinks. We also went for cocktails at the Three Sixty Lounge which was amazing during the sunset. Overall we loved our stay!"
We stayed here for 2 nights with family. Thank you very much to Khun Ning who checked in us on the first day for your warm welcome with smile and kindness for room upgrades. Your precious service make us feel very happy to stay here and very touched.
"Making a direct call to the hotel at 22:00 and several times (until 22:30), unable to have the front office/reception taking my operator forwarded call and the longest 10 minutes (not 3-5 rings !!). The Operator unable to get a reply, saying the reception being busy. Asking to be connected with the ‚Äòduty manager‚Äô (K. Gib), not remorse understanding of service and a customer calling several times, waiting minutes, with no answer/no reply. It‚Äôs sad where the industry has come and situations badly handled."
"I stayed five nights at the Millenium Hilton in Bangkok because I found a very advantageous offer that allowed me to benefit from the executive suite at almost the price of the standard room. The room was very nice and neat, with two marble bathrooms and a spectacular view of the river. Both from the bedroom and from the living room. The breakfast buffet was delicious. Highly recommended"
"This is a third time to stay here and it's my mistake. I booked three booking at the same time and I don't know what I will see. 1. I booked the room with campaign that can early check-in and late check-out. Firstly, I call to book directly to the hotel. No one tell me that it's not guarantee and I understand that It guarantee because It list on benefit of the campaign. 1 week before check-in, I call to front to remark them about early check-in, so they cannot do anything and ask me back to call them one day before check-in. OK, 1 day before check-in, I call to front again and they said that they cannot guarantee, please call them back on check-in day. On check-in day, around 10.00am, I call to front again and they say first come, first serve. This is so terrible for me and get"
This is my 2nd time stay during covid situation period . I‚Äôm Hilton honors gold status tier holder.They did‚Äôt pay attention much about royalty members. Lots of renovations  going on in the hotel.Hotel room is very pretty and quite clean. Breakfast at Hilton Sukhumvit  better than here. Staff attitude and service mind is average but still have some of them provided me a good service like Khun Tuu ( At fitness center ) and Khun Ann ( Maya restaurant). As my experienced I won‚Äôt consider to stay here again.
Was there with my Dad after a late night dinner.. Great hotel and very good view at night and morning. It is right next to the river and you can see Icon Siam right there.  Service was okay. Greeted in the front and that was it.  Buffet was okay in terms of food. But the service was regular nothing special.

This hotel is very luxurious and the location is central.  The rooms have a breathtaking beautiful view on the river and all the services are excellent.  The food is varied and excellent cleanliness excellent
"We have been staying here since the hotel opened in (I think) 2008 & although we have flirted with other hotels occasionally - nothing beats this place! Super location, great staff & a super Executive Lounge make this a winner, time & time again. Thanks to Khun Fye on the Executive floor for looking after us so well on our 3 stays this year. Looking forward to the renovations being completed & seeing the results first hand. Highly recommended."
"I must say that the atmosphere and the service rendered by the members of staff at 36 bar at Millennium Hilton (Prem, Nat and Pure) truly made a magnificent evening for me after the entire day of stressful work. Thanks to them, I ended up having a happy ending of the day. Prem was so willing and sincere to find me the best spots to take gorgeous photos which made me extremely happy. Those are probably the best photos ever taken in years!!!!! Nat and Pure also did not fail to provide me with the impeccable service. Professional crew!!! I have discovered my shelter and it is here!!!"
"I stayed at several Hilton properties in Thailand but this one was by far the best one! The staff were definitely a whole lot better than Conrad Bangkok, which is surprising to me. Great communication with the hotel manager so got an upgrade to a suite, which probably made a good first impression. The check-in process at the Exec lounge was awesome. Again, applause to the staff! They were well-trained and very very nice. I definitely feel that Diamond member has some value at this property. Stayed here for a whole week and it was great every day. They had a really huge breakfast selections. All type of Thai, Chinese, Indian, western food that I don't think I ate all of them in one week stay. There is a free transit boat to the sky train. The pool was really cool.  It is right"
"I just checked in and there has an event when I checked in. I saw the room type and floor where can I got provided at hilton app in advance. However, I proceed check in at the reception. When I checking in, I ask the high floor and she said okay. I expect the 20 floor cause I can see the floor is available at the app. However she gave me 15th floor and I ask to higher room. She said all the guest should be stayed at 15th floor due to effect of covid19. I really don‚Äôt understand cause I already confirm the floor before the visit. I said the app showing that I can check in higher room but she still insist I should stay at 15th floor and it is the highest room where she can provide. Actually this is not my first stay and I visited this hotel 3 times even this year and this is the"
"Room was ok but would be better if staff gave cus a better view at Icon Siam side. Coffee in room was a joke while other hotel with same category offer capsule coffee with better quality.  Since I am member of Hhonors, hope to get better treat like other membership programs.   Bed was good. Quite comfortable.   Service boat to skytrain was closed. Not convenient anymore. Quite disappointed while other hotels offer better deal and better service.   Will not return again till they change the management and quality."
"For our first ever trip to Thailand, our family stayed at the Millennium Hilton for 3 nights during the Chinese New Year period. The service was so good that after returning from the Conrad Maldives, we ended up cancelling our one night stay on 31st Jan originally booked at the Sheraton across the river and stayed again this hotel.  I'm both Hilton Diamond and Marriott Platinum so the elite benefits were similar, but the service offered at this hotel during our first stay was just beyond expectations, which meant it was a no brainer to stay here again during our final night in thailand.  We stayed in the newly renovated Executive Panoramic Suite, facing north during our first stay and facing south on the second stay. The suites were excellent, clean, decent sized, and both"
Great location for stay and pleasaure. The popular IconSiam with fruitful options of restaurants and shops is connected with  steps away. The highfloor views facing river and IconSiam are especially spectacular both in day and night. The Executive lounge on top of the floors are also cozy and worthwhile.
We stayed at this place for 7 nights and decided to change it up halfway through by changing rooms to face the other way down the river and it was great!! We did prefer the side facing the shopping mall and MO but both sides are decent. Try to get the highest floor you can and do check out the top restaurant and bar for some amazing sunset views. Unless you can enjoy the executive lounge as they have similar stunning sunset views! Really one of the best value for Money Hilton‚Äôs in BKK and the location along the river and next to a shopping mall is perfect if your going to China town or any Michelin star places. Ohh I almost forget the pool has a super view of the river a great place to have a cold one and get away from the hustle and bustle of BKK.
"We went during the Covid-19 Outbreak, but after conditions were lifted for Local shops, and restaurants to reopen.  Like most big establishments taking time to remodel or do some much needed construction. They set up a barrier, and did there best to make sure not to inconvenience any guest who decided to stay at the hotel. Which was very nice, and considerate of the management to think of the guest first.   This Resort is located in a very awesome location that has a back entrance where you can access the river front, as well a near by local market where you can eat local food as well shop for some medium priced wears. You can also find fairy access to go across the river to visit the local temple as well.  Near by is a SkyTrain station soon to be completed as well the road"
"A vicious virus, flights cancelled, accommodations closed.  In this context ,the Millennium Hilton has been a secure place of refuge.  Their staff remain pleasant with their signature smiles.  Their service is excellent.  Their team is hopeful.  A hotel this good during trying times deserves your patronage when the healing begins--when travel, vacations and explorations resume."
"I stayed at this hotel for one night only and I was very happy because Ning(I think she‚Äôs a DM) kindly got my room upgraded with complimentary from ‚ÄúKing premium room‚Äù to ‚ÄúKing executive room‚Äù due to my Hilton gold tier. Not only Ning but GG(Gungang? Sorry, I forgot her accurate name though.) the receptionist gave me the good smile. I know that this Covid -19 situation makes the less guests stay. It is because of this situation that the staffs should make single guest more important. Anyway, thank you very much, Ning and GG. I‚Äôm coming back soon after this non alcoholic duration. I‚Äôll look forward to upgrading my room with Lounge access.üòäü§≤"
"Well located on the river.  Lovely hotel.  We had execuive level room, a beautiful river view room. Large and well appointed. The pool is lovely and an oasis in the big city.  Food in the lounge was delicious.  The rooftop area is spectacular and a wonderful place to have a drink at sunset.   Really like this hotel.  Only concern I had was mosquitos in the lobby restaurant."
"we stayed here for 3 nights in an executive room we was given a free upgrade for my husbands birthday that we was delighted with, we had fantastic views over the river brilliant to watch all the boats pass by, we visited their roof top bar this is a must to go to while staying here it has fantastic panoramic views over the city, the swimming pool area is also a nice spot the drinks are pretty pricey though with a bottle of water costing you 300 baht, even the water in your mini bar will set you back 160 baht but if you walk out side the hotel you can buy bottles of water for just 10 baht, the breakfast was nice with both Thai breakfast and continental on offer, we tried there buffet restaurant for the evening and was very disappointed with the variety for the price and did not"
We recently stayed at the Hilton Bangkok! We were nervous about visiting Bangkok with the Coronavirus but the hotel was extremely clean and professional. The staff were very friendly and couldn‚Äôt do enough to help. The highlight has to be the executive lounge which serves drinks between 5pm-8pm. Amazing view and very relaxing to sit and watch the sun go down and Bangkok light up!
Excellent service from moment we arrived ! Customer service -staff couldn‚Äôt do enough -offered help and advice on where to go. Food wonderful and great location on the river with a free boat to main harbour for transport ! Love the Hiltons -strongly recommended
Another excellent stay - we've lost count how many times but this was either our tenth or eleventh stay. Unbeatable location on the river and amazing rooms and suites always make this our hotel of choice when we are in Bangkok. Thanks to Robert Operations Manager for listening to our feedback which will keep us coming back every time. A special mention also for Tan (Front Desk) who always welcomed us and other guests with great warmth and a huge smile and Ice from the Executive Lounge for always being so efficient and warm. We'll be back soon!
"We stayed here for 4 nights and I can confirm that is a 5 star hotel with a very convenient location. It was clean,comfortable and the stuff was kind and very helpful.The breakfast was rich and they have a lot of options."
"Stayed at 25th floor. View at night is breathtaking, colorful lights and movements of boats along the river was a different site to see. This hotel is near Icon Siam Shopping Mall and Seven Eleven Convenience Store."
"We stayed here for two nights while vacationing in Thailand and Cambodia. Everything was top notch including the comforatable rooms, the pool and the wait staff. We would recommend the Millennium Hilton to anyone traveling to Bankok as it is near many downtown attractions,"
"I choose to stay here because I‚Äôm a loyal Hilton diamond member, and after a long journey here, it was a prefect choice to begin my travels in Thailand! I stayed up on one of the executive floors, with an incredible view and a beautiful room. I love how quiet it was! One things that hard to find in big hotels, the staff was so polite and quiet, I would of thought I was staying in a private villa! The executive floor gives you access to the executive lounge which was beautiful as well! I felt the 2 hour window for happy hour got a little crowded and rushed, but it was very good so I can see why! The pool was great, a little cold, and loved the lounge chairs in the water. The breakfast at the hotel was out of this world! So many choices! I could of spend hours there! The staff"
"I came to stay at this hotel for the first time having already visited the 360 rooftop bar and I can confidently say this was one of my best stays and experiences in a Hilton property worldwide. The rooms were absolutely stunning overlooking the Chao Phya river. The breakfast was extremely delicious and the staff themselves were absolutely fabulous and wonderful. K'Pakkad is absolutely amazing she is so polite, helpful and always willing to go out of her way to help her guests as well as K'Ning, whos service was amazing she was doing everything possible to make sure I had a very memorable stay and I am ever so grateful. K'Dan the Concierge is an absolutely class and elegant professional who is extremely well spoken. I was also extremely lucky to meet the FOM K'Nee who made me"
"We stayed at the Millennium for three nights and it was honestly faultless. The staff were all so friendly and accommodating and the room was spotless and had a great view of the city.  We had breakfast in the hotel two of the days we stayed, everything was lovely, fresh fruit and yoghurts, omelettes made to order, a lovely selection of baked goods, etc.   We made a visit to the pool on the 4th floor which is absolutely lovely and again, so clean! Really refreshing to go for a dip.  The Three Sixty Bar was great at night for panoramic views of the city and lovely cocktails (the ginger martini was a personal favourite)."
"Being a Hilton Diamond member, we were granted early check-in and late check-out. We also had access to the Executive Lounge, which has a beautiful paranomic view over the River.  All the staff at Millennium Hilton Bangkok are very eager to help and had provided top-notch service. Overall, we are very happy with our stay there."
"Returned to this hotel for a short stay, 10 years after my last visit. The newly renovated Executive Suite was indeed comfortable. However, housekeeping had done a poor job, as the carpets had not been vacuum cleaned  from the previous guests (we found lots of potato chips, clusters of hairs, paper- and plastic pieces on the carpets), making us feel the room was not clean. The room was then serviced once again.  Also, the room was very hot throughout our stay (despite adjusting the air con to 70 degrees on full speed). Indeed, we found all the public areas in the hotel to be very hot, especially the Executive Lounge.   The staff in the Exec. Lounge were professional and friendly, thank you! However, in spite of offering one of the best views of the Bangkok skyline, I found the"
"Hotel is located right on the river front with access to the riverboat to the BTS station   Hotel is next to the ivonsiam shopping mall, we stayed in an exec room on the 27th floor and the view from my room was my best view ever !!    Breakfast was really good too with a high quality and choice of food ...   The exec room gives you access to the roof bar and between 5 and 7 is free cocktails and drinks with snacks and is a great place to see the sun go down over Bangkok !   A really great hotel and staff"
"Very nice service from all staff. Room is very comfortable,  nice views and clean.  The best Breakfast in the world,  nice coffee shop and great taste ‚òïüëçüç∞ of coffee, tea, cake & cookies. Easy to walk to Icon Siam shopping centre, free boat service to Sathon pier for get on BTS. We will back to visit again."
"Apart from the view which is stunning, everything else about the Millennium is underwhelming.  The rooms are clean but basic, complimentary water but thereafter drinks are 10-15x the price of the 7/11 opposite.  The pool area is frankly odd - the swimming pool is covered meaning the water is an icy 23c. Part of the lounge area resembles an I paved car park while the bar is nothing more than fridge and trolley.  We weren‚Äôt allowed to checkin before 3pm so had a lengthy wait - at 3pm they were having IT issues so we had a further wait while we were assigned a room.  Overall it‚Äôs suggest avoiding - there‚Äôs better hotels for the price range."
Every time we visit Bangkok we stay here and everytime it is perfect. The service from the staff in all departments is impeccable and they have always provided kind and friendly service on each of our visits. The breakfast is also fantastic and great value for money. Thank you for an enjoyable stay.
"Nothing overtly wrong with this property. Location is on the ""wrong"" side of the river for most Bangkok attractions, and getting over by Taxi /Grabcar can be slow in the usual traffic shenanigans.  Check-in experience was disappointing due to the speed and general disinterest of the staff on the desk. They weren't rude, just not engaging or friendly, and very transactional in their approach to guests.  Room was clean but bathroom very small for a suite."
"This is an excellent hotel with superb service. We stayed in a Family Suite on the 17th floor for the extra space and were not disappointed.  This hotel is situated next to a gigantic newly built shopping mall with multiple food options, although I had the hotel‚Äôs own prawn Pad Thai by the pool and it was fantastic. Ah, the pool, in an area on the fourth floor known as The Beach. We spent a few hours there and it was a lovely start to our holiday. You wan walk in a few inches of water between the loungers (and there are enough of these with some underneath gazebos and also some big beanbags available. You can look out to the river below and see (and hear) the many boats passing by. It‚Äôs good, as you are high enough to have some peace whilst at the same time there is good visual"
The breakfast buffet was excellent! There were many selections with an assortment of foods from many parts of the world. The service attendants were great with removing our dishes and asking us about coffee refills.
"Really enjoyed the welcome, the rooftop view is flawless!   Really clean, great service, food and staff.  Our room had a view to the River, we really enjoyed. They decorated the room really nicely for our honeymoon.   They gave us a map of the city and perfectly explained how to get to all the tourist attractions.   Walking distance from the new shopping center IconSiam and they tons of stuff in there (indoor floating market, great shops, cool night fountain shows).  I would for sure stay here again."
"Stayed a this hotel many times but things went off the rails this time. Luggage got lost a concierege, taking an hour to get reolved then disappointed to recieve a hand written additionl  cost  as a I checked in stating that my 5 year old daughter will be charged 700/baht per day for her lounge access, however this was not visible on the website at the time of booking .A very stiff charge for someone who has coco pops for breakfast and some satay skewers and a juice in the evening. A bit of a bitter pill. Only ever had good experiences within the Hilton brand to up to this point being a Diamond member for over 10 years always made things better but not on this occassion."
"We spent 5 nights at this beautifully situated hotel on the Chao Praya River.  We stayed here several years ago when the shopping and night life were across the river but now the exciting IconSiam center is right next door with shops, restaurants and a fabulous fountain and light show 3 times per evening.  There is a convenient regular shuttle boat to the BTS station. As Diamond members we were given a renovated room on an executive floor.  The room was quite small but functional and had a great view of the river.  Two negatives about the room:  there was no hot water to the sink no matter how long you let the water run and there was a faint smell of sewer at various times during the day and night.  The executive lounge on the 31st floor had stunning views, and good food and"
"Cannot recommend enough..great value for money Great location next to Iconsiam just a very short walk Breakfasts are just too much !! No need to eat again for many hours ,,,,rooms are modern and spacious .....Robbie Little"
"We were on Celebrity Millennium that docked for two days at the LAEMCHABANG port, so we decided to stay overnight at the Millennium Hilton in Bangkok.  The hotel is located along the Chao Phraya River.  We were picked up by Hilton‚Äôs ferryboat at the SP Taksin Bridge.  The boat ride took about 5 minutes.  We were too early for check-in, so we left our luggage at the hotel and went to the shopping complex next door for lunch.  By the time we came back to the hotel, our room was ready.  We were on the 14th floor overlooking the river.  The room itself was small but comfortable.  Breakfast was in a large airy restaurant with a lot of international selections.    To visit any of the attractions along the Chao Phraya River, we had to take the hotel‚Äôs ferryboat (runs every 30 minutes)"
"An old property which has become an attractive location due to its immediate proximity to Icon Siam, the latest and best mall in Bangkok.   However, its age shows as public areas look out of date. The pool area is a disappointment as its not at all an area to relax unlike other pool areas of similarly rated hotels in Bangkok.   The rooms are small. This must be one of the few 4-5 star hotels in Bangkok with no espresso machine in room. There is also no turn down service. The bathroom amenities are of poor quality. Cleanliness is an issue. A cockroach was found in the bathroom.   Check-in and out process is slow and with long lines, the process is even slower and not what is expected of this class of hotel. Staff at check-in and out are robotic and process driven and smiles are"
"Stayed here during a short 3 days holiday and loved it. My HHoners status was recognized, and I was given a high floor room with a superb view over the Chao Phyra river. The room was well appointed, but on the smaller size. Service was generally outstanding, especially at the lovely lounge during sundowner time. Breakfast at the main restaurant was great in terms of quality, service and setting. Overall, highly recommended!"
The location and the views is what gives this property a resort feel. Nestled between Iconsiam and Khlong San Market on the river with easy connection to various city highlights is its strongest point. Everything else is just icing on the cake.  Booked 12 nights using a mixture of cash and Hilton points - 10 nights family suite and 2 nights of Panorama suite (booked what I could find) for 2 adults and our 2 children (ages 8 and 11). Got 6 nights of family suite and 6 nights panorama suite due to availability. This make it being upgraded 4 out of the 12 nights or 34% upgrade rate as a Diamond elite member of the Hilton loyalty program - an accomplishment in my opinion considering that is was the busy season and they are fully booked through the holidays. We thank the hotel
"Free shuttle ferry to main pier across the riverüëç, great breakfast, basic standard room for the price, ¬£117 for 2 people (Twin Room) not bad including amazing breakfast, great view at roof top bar (expensive)."
"We received great service from all the friendly staff in the hotel from the concierge staff, to the housekeepers to the restaurant.  A special thank you to the restaurant staff and, in particular, the restaurant manager, who came over and said hello to us each time we visited the restaurant to make sure everything was OK.  Finally, I appreciated the extra effort of Meen who was working at the HHonors desk.  He made our departure so easy for us, printing out our boarding passes and making sure we had everything settled for the next leg of our trip.  He went above and beyond what was required and we appreciate it."
"Can be reached by taxi or go to the nearest mrt station then taxi Also they offer shuttle boat services every 30 mins from Taksin pier Beautiful hotel, jacuzzi spa bathtub, spectacular views of the city, next to the riverbank Stuff is friendly Rooftop bar with nice views but expensive. Expect to pay $15 for a orange juice Breakfast by the river in the Flow restaurant"
"Quite nice Hilton property in Central Bangkok. Located right by the river and offering spectacular views from the rooms and especially from the executive lounge, which has an open-air sitting area. Staff was nice and efficient, room was a little small, but well equipped. No issues whatsoever. Would definitely come back here."
"Nice rooms on the Executive floor, good food, extremely nice and helpful staff. I was here 8 times and was always satisfied a place to recommend. Next to ICON SIAM is an additional advantage puts the whole area to the next level."
"Have just come back from an enjoyable stay at the Hilton millennium Bangkok, usually stay at the krunthep wing if the shangri la but its getting increasingly expensive so tried this instead. The check in was fast and courteous,the staff are all outgoing and friendly whilst remaining professional. The benefits of executive rooms are pretty standard and the food options were less than others I've visited but were adequate and in line with the amount we paid for the room,the staff really do make this hotel special and made us very welcome and our wine glasses were topped up regularly..special thanks to prahn (hopefully spelt right) as her warm and welcoming nature made our stay even more enjoyable üòäthanks guys"
"Never swipe your bank cards for the holding fees, I was at the hotel from the 11th January to 14th January 2020.  The hotel claims that the reversal was done on the day of check-out but to date the fees do not appear back to my account.  On correspondence with the hotel, the hotel want me now to contact my bank to sort this out. Why must I now be inconvenienced with all the administration to get my money back.  its totally unacceptable the now its my responsibility to sort this out and the Hotel just keep says that the reversal was done and clearly it was not done.  For the star rating of this hotel its totally unacceptable and I will NEVER stay again at this hotel"
"We loved our newly renovated panoramic suite! The decor was fresh and modern, with enough Thai elements in the decor to give the hotel its unique cultural identity. The light-flow was superb and the bed very comfortable, making it a sanctuary in a big vibrant city! The shuttle boat was punctual, and a comfortable, efficient way to get to Saphan Taksin BTS Station, from which we can easily access the rest of Bangkok. If you love malls, Iconsiam is a mere 5-minute walk away! The staff at Flow did an admirable job seating fussy guests during breakfast; they ensured that tables were cleared and coffee topped up promptly. The young gentleman who was assigned to clean my room on the 23rd floor on the 27 and 28 of January, was hardworking and efficient, and he was always so cheerful"
Nice views but sterile feel about the family suite room. Lacked pictures on the walls  Empty unusable space wasted could be made more functional. Sofa bed in lounge area is ok very firm. Tiny bathroom in master bedroom  River & temple Views were very nice from rm 2528   Swimming pool tiny lap pool not very inviting no decent landscaping in pool area  I thought this was a budget hotel pool not a Hilton hotel pool. Short walk to the best shopping centre in Bangkok Icon Siam   Overall a good location  Boat rides make it easier to avoid the famous Bangkok traffic jams.
"We were only here a few short days before going to Chiang Mai. Everything is a way's out from the airport but it was definitely worth it. This hotel was clean, had great food and drinks, and had a really exceptional pool deck and rooftop bar. I highly recommend for anyone's stay in Bangkok. Definitely check out the shopping next door at the Icon Siam!"
"I think The Millennium  Hilton offers the best value for your money in Bangkok.I have stayed here many, many times in the past and consider this my go to hotel in Bangkok.  The personnel behind the front desk are extremely professional and have always been incredibly helpful. There is nothing they won't do to try and accommodate your needs when reasonable. The food in any of the restaurants is spectacular to say the least, not cheap but a cut above.  The breakfast is probably the best in Bangkok, in my opinion..They have both Western and Asian options, fruits, salads, pastries and more..I have been coming to BKK for over 15 years. The front desk always acknowledges my status as a Diamond Level member, welcomes me honestly and most recently upgraded me to a panoramic suite on the"
"Stayed December 2019, travelled with family. The lobby was awesome, staff very friendly and helpful. We booked club rooms so we checked in on the 31st floor in the Club Lounge; it has amazing views across the city and over the Chao Phraya River from inside as well as the outdoor seating area. The connecting Club rooms were awesome, clean and with all the amenities you need but the best part is the view! Except for a slightly longer than normal wait at Sathorn Pier on one occasion, the free shuttle boat worked out well, really convenient way to access the Sky Train, the river boat taxis and tourist site boats. The amazing Icon Siam with its indoor food market is almost next door! Breakfast was amazing! A variety of options for most taste buds and really great service! Best hotel"
"I liked the Millennium as the location is excellent and it had everything we needed.  Good breakfast spread.  Rooms with views of the river.  Boat shuttle to the other side.  Next door to ICON Siam, one of the largest shopping malls in Bangkok.  Nice rooms and good service.  Highly recommended"
"Our stay in this hotel was really good. The room was very comfortable, clean, well maintained and up to Hilton standards and the swimming pool area was also nice. It is very well situated by the Chao Phraya river and if you want to reach certain places you could just take the hotel shuttle boat to avoid the traffic of the streets. It has a rooftop bar with a superb view, great drinks and food if you want to snack. I didn't give this hotel a full rating because there are better Hiltons out there and because the service was just okay."
"We stayed at Hilton Millennium Bangkok for our friends wedding and it was one of the best stay that we had during the trip.  The suite was well equipped, they have small bar, great views and my favourite is the working desk and small living room and the hotel located just next door to Icons Siam shopping centre where they had great food and for people that love to shop, this is your go to stay!  Staff was excellent, kind and helpful especially during the wedding preparation we all very busy running around they are 24/7 available to helped us.  This hotel is the absolute definition of 5 stars, great property, great location, great staff! Would recommend this to everyone!"
"Very nice hotel located next to Iconsiam. Super friendly and professional staff and special thanks to Mrs Aom at the front desk for early check in. It was kind gesture after long flight. Room is very nice, recently renovated and we particularly loved the big window with amazing view on the river. We will come back for sure."
We picked via reviews here and were so happy with our choice.  Beautiful hotel and we were so glad we stayed on the river.  The hotel provides a shuttle water taxi to the main station which made seeing the sites easy and fun via river travel.  The hotel is beautiful and has great food and a fantastic rooftop cocktail/view/appetizer experience.
"My wife and I returned to the Millenium for the 4th time.  Upgraded to an executive room. We love it here and things have only got better with the opening of ICONSIAM next door. The exec lounge remains one of our favourites in Asia, with it's unbeatable river views from the 31st floor terrace (although happy hour would be better 6-8pm rather than 5-7pm).  Staff super helpful as ever, refurbished rooms are bright and airy.  The only place for us in Bangkok."
"Good view from cho pra ya river and close to big shopping mall The Icon  siam , Delicious international food and breakfast.The room is comforable clear and clean staff are very helpful  recommand to stay if come to stay Thailand."
"Second time staying at this hotel and the room was great, hotel in good shape, although my 1 complaints is how long it took to check in but at least snacks and drinks were available in the Executive lounge while I waited. This time I was able to get a break from meetings and get a massage at the spa, WONDERFUL! Money well spent, highly recommend Thai massage."
I stayed at the Millenieum Hilton for New Years Eve and then again for 2 days prior to returning home. The staff are very professional and nice and the rooms are really nice. Great bathroom and water pressure!  Good room service. It was NOT an inexpensive stay and the NYE party on the roof was ok but not great but the location is wonderful and I would stay there again.
"We had a wonderful 3 night stay in Bangkok which was made so easy by the great location of the hotel. Situated right on the waterfront and next door to the wonderful Iconsiam shopping complex.  The hotel has a shuttle water taxi to the other side of the river where you can take many more water taxis to other tourist attractions. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. We are diamond members so were able to enjoy the executive lounge with its wonderful views of the river. I would like to mention how charming, friendly and helpful all the staff were in the lounge. The breakfast was amazing with many options including freshly cooked poached eggs on a muffin and cooked and served with a smile too. The Operations manager regularly spoke to us in the lounge asking if everything"
"I really do not understand why this hotel refuses to upgrade the awful food it presents in the Exec lounge. For years every review i do , this is the central problem. The German Lady GM need to visit the sister hotel CONRAD  and truly see how wonderful Exec Lounge food can be -- presented professionally and with style.  The main restaurant at Breakfast is simply sensational with an equally stunning view as the lounge has.  Rooms and suites are wonderful and housekeeping is so good and discreet.  It is always a pleasure to return here."
"As a Hilton regular and fan, this hotel is always on my list of stays. I used my hard earned points  to stay here but all I get is disappointment. The staffs was rude and the young assistant Front desk manager, despite her youth and seniority, she was arrogant and language was offensive and she made us feel Not important. As a result, we spent most time dine and walk around ICONSIAM next door, we were treated better in the shopping mall than our own hotel! please noted there are no direct boat service to ICON SIAM despite its only next door to each other, you can either walk via the man road, or via the shuttle to Sathon Pier. Despite so many negative reviews about this hotel, I was still eager to stay here and really were looking forward to our stay. So we are bitterly doubly"
We were slightly apprehensive about our future stay at the Hilton after reading some of the recent reviews of the service at the executive lounge.  We are delighted to say that the service has been excellent. The Hilton have clearly taken on board the feedback and we are enjoying the results!! Robert the Operations Director was very engaging and gave us some helpful sightseeing tips. The food and sundowners were a gorgeous taste of Thailand and our glasses never went empty. Will definitely stay again and recommend the Hilton Executive room and service at the Hilton Millennium in Bangkok. It is also in one of the best locations in Bangkok what‚Äôs not to like!!
"I have stayed here a few times now and the lack of consistency in service is what lets this hotel down.  This trip I had a exec room reserved and checked in at the lobby where I was expecting to be taken to the lounge to complete the formalities, however, this didn't happen.  No recognition of HH status and I was allocated a room adjoining the lift shaft which was incredibly noisy so requested a room change. My profile on my account clearly states a room away from the elevators is my preferred choice, but seemingly ignored.  The room itself was fine, albeit a little on the small side, but the view over the river was very good and the soundproofing seemed to be effective.  My previous review of this hotel commented on the poor quality of the food and beverages offered in the"
"The fourth time to stay here. This says something, hm? It says: a good balance quality - price. It also says location, of course, river trips, excellent restaurant, good breakfast variety and nice upper floor rooms view.  A nice surprise at this time, was the new mall few steps nearby.   Always good to come back!"
