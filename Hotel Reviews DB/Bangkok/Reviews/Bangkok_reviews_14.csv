"Good food, great service, but a stunning view. Floor to ceiling and wall to wall windows made the room a real pleasure. The bidet feature seemed a bit small and flimsy but worked well enough. Good Covid protection."
"A perfect hotel located near the bts asok station, which is very useful and very helpful and kind staff! (especially the Japanese female staff at the reception desk) I stayed here for my birthday, they offered a surprise birthday cake to my room. I am touched by the kind thought.  I will stay the hotel for my special day again. Highly recommended !"
"Excellent service, spacious well-appointed rooms with tub. Very modern and always very clean. Extremely well equipped gym and good sized pool that you can really swim in. The food and drinks may be rather more limited especially breakfast than in some other hotels, but the quality-value is very good. Perfect for a staycation too!"
At 11.30PM the fire alarm rang multiple times and we had to rush down 25 floors just to find out the technicians accidentally caused the alarm to ring. The hotel only apologized but didn’t do anything else to amend this inconvenience. We were very upset so we left that night and go home.
"The 3rd time to come here. Very good view with nice all staffs especially K.Go. He good taking care us all time. This time have new menu such as sausage , Australian steak and Prawn with chili oil, so yummy. Love happy hour so much. See again next time surely."
"I saw this hotel from the skytrain then I decided to try for 1 night here and never disappoint. The building is very unique compare to it's neighborhood.  Staffs at lobby were friendly I feel very welcome since I enter the hotel.  Khun Nuam bellboy who help me with luggage and escorted me to my room is helpful. He invited me to hotel's skybar which I can say that this bar become one of my list already. I went to skybar during happy hour as Khun Nuam suggest, the drinks were great, the view also stunning. Room was ok, view from room was incredible. I haven't try Chinese restaurant but I will come back again to try it."
"Excellent. I am now a regular here. Excellent beds, facilities (sauna, pool, gym, etc) are very good, comfy beds, good location. Outstanding is also the food, it is good in most five star hotels in Bangkok but it is particularly good hear. Last but not least the staff, Ying in Customer Service and all here colleagues, the entire team, are very nice try to make each of my stays special."
We enjoyed an amazing stay in a high floor room. The club package was totally worth every baht we paid.   The hotel-rooms are equipped with everything one can desire. And the view is stunning.  The Covid 19 measures are high and perfect in every way.   The staff is super attentive and speaks perfect English.   We had one problem with very loud neighbors at 3 am but the hotel immediately fixed the problem. They are really moving heaven and earth to accommodate you in the best way.   We will be back soon.
"A truly professional property. Its obvious everything designed by people with many years of experience in hospitality. The service, the facilities, the room design and amenities are beautiful, clever and thoughtful"
"This hotel is superb.  The staff amazing. My only criticism is the price of the drinks on the roof bar which were extortionate, which might partially explain why it was empty.  I will skip this next time - but I will definitely return."
"From check-in to check out, I have nothing but praise for this Hotel. Very modern rooms, decent food options (Unfortunately some limitations due to Covid), friendly and flexible staff. The innovative cake creations at the Coffee shop are worth a try, as are the amazing Cocktails served at the Rooftop Bar. Receptionist was always ready to react to my requests, special mention goes to ... (No, that would be unfair to all the others!)"
"Room is so great I got upgrade for my birthday , I have a good experience,stuff very friendly ,good service ,room clean ,beautiful view The hotel is so private  I definitely come back again for sure next vacation"
"I love the service and the room quite nice and clean ! Highly recommended for stay in this nice hotel, and for this month they have one year anniversary promotion for the breakfast just add on for one bath for the second night ~"
"2nd time back at this hotel. Hotel room was clean and in good condition, staff were all friendly and service was good. Will definitely be going back and highly recommended to anyone who’s looking for a hotel stay at Sukhumvit area."
"The rooms were clean, very comfortable, and the staff was amazing and very hospitable and there for every need of mine.  Especially Art, Esther and the other Japanese receptionist.( Front desk, concierge also call service)  They went over and beyond to make me stay enjoyable. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Bangkok"
"Perfect workation place, superb staff (fast, quick, full information and care) Korean Staff impressed me by follow up my request had completed instead of just passed to department concerned and this for me, it really called luxury service. They did good in all areas. (Lobby bar, Front desk, concierge and even call service)"
"Rooms were excellent and the location is extremely convenient. The front desk staff were extremely pleasant also upgrading our room when we checked in. The breakfast buffet wasn't the best but it is understandable given the covid situation. Thank you to the staff for a pleasant stay, particularly Jeong Daun."
It was my first time staying at the Carlton Hotel and it was great. It went beyond my expectations. The employees are professional and attentive. The room is clean and very comfortable. Everything is SO convenient. And the price is great. I couldn't even wish for such a pleasant stay for it's value.
"For the past few months I have been staying at Carlton Sukhumvit regularly on the weekends and long streches at time and had a fantastic stay everytime. The room, facility and staff, most especially the staff, was always welcoming and excellent.  Special mention goes to the reception staff such as Esther and Ning and others who always made me welcome, they were highly attentive, kind & lovely and provided a more than excellent service that made all my stay memorable. Special mention also to the whole lobby team and the excellent staff of Plunge juice bar. Highly recommend this hotel for your stay."
"I had a stay with my friends at Carlton hotel BKK. Room no. 2201  on 12 Jan 2021  For the room and facility in a hotel. This  hotel is very new, clean, modern rooms, nice view. Me and my friends Many pictures can be taken from inside this room. The swimming pool is very wide, beautiful view. But unfortunately, I can't go into the pool with my friends because of the situation covid 19 . so we just take a picture. For service in a hotel. When we entering the hotel, the receptionist were a very good service. Especially Khun Nuam, Khun Japan were very friendly and helpful. During our check-in a receptionist Khun Esther Talking makes me feel as relaxed look like acquaintance. While we were seated Khun Aew knelt came to us and brought the registration politely to sign. While I will be"
"I am very impressed with the service of this hotel.  I feel good to stay here and would like to bring my acquaintances to stay as well if given the opportunity.  And while resting, I called the service because I needed water and there was always a staff member who was Khun Bird, who thanked him for his quick and impressive service."
"I love the feel of Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit it  reminds me how I love the hospitality industry because it is always priceless to welcome strangers when they feel instantly home. I didn’t watch tv at all the view from my room is just magnificent. Behind the masks, I can sense the genuine sincerity of the staff through there eyes and actions.  Amazing experience! There were some minor mishaps but nobody is perfect, it is such a shame that I had a call from work that I had to cut my 2 night visit.   #MakeEveryHotelYourSecondHomre #MySecondHome  #AtHomeWithCarltonBKK"
"Stayed there a few times in 2020 and over the new year. Hotel is brand new, which is amazing in itself, so fresh, no smells in the room, and finally I found a hotel with a good air conditioning system in the room that is not freezing and not loud, it is quiet and does exactly what you want it to do.   Nice bathroom too, and everything just works perfectly.  The best part of the stay were the staff though, some of the friendliest and most attentive I ever met. Especially the Korean lady at reception, Ester. She remembered my name from day one and even when I came back after a few months with no booking, just a walk in, she remembered my name. Impressive, she should get a raise :)  Anyway, everything else was great too, facilities and the pool are fantastic.   This is definitely"
"Pros:  - Hotel is very new. So, general conditions in all area are still very good. - Room is good. Bed linen is also very new. - Overall cleanliness is also good. - Staffs are friendly and hospitable. - Rooftop bar is quite nice with good vibes. - Full facilities in room are setup well. - Swimming pool is nice and big. - Breakfast is satisfying. - Lobby area is beautiful decorated. - There are various choices of cake which look so tasty. - Hotel is located in a walkable range to the train stations or department stores.  Cons. - Unfortunately, the hotel just opened and encounters pandemic situation. So, some facilities look not fully function. - Except the headboard in guestroom which is beautiful, overall design of room is too simple. (personally) - There is a bad smell from"
"I had a staycation at Carlton hotel and my experience has been nothing but amazing! Staff was super accommodating , the room is very clean and facility is super great. Would recommend anyone to come staying here"
Great stay with some teething issues but still a great hotel. These are purely comments which i hope will help as i experienced.   Arrival: Arrived in a limousine from The Peninsula and had to wait for over 5 minutes as the car infront was trying to Valet and blocking the entrance but the driver was in a full flow conversation with the bell boy who didnt even acknowledge our car trying to arrive.  Eventually a small wave.    Bell Boys and Management ALWAYS very friendly when entering or leaving the hotel during my stay.   Reception great welcome and very friendly. I had two consecutive bookings to make things more complicated. Great explanation of the hotel facilities too. Lovely.   Bedroom fabulously looking but there is NO plug socket for a hairdryer near to a mirror. Had to
"Lovely room, and great service.  The staff are the real credit to this hotel.  Super polite and courteous. Top hotel in the heart of Bangkok and lovely rooms, location and service.  A proper 5 star hotel."
I was stay in Carlton hotel last month and it was honestly faultless. The staff were all nice and very helpful especially khun gob khun ploy and nuam also the room was spotless and had a great view of the city.
"I am usually a Google person so if there is a review on tripadvisor, it has to be very special.   Service 5/5 Rooms 5/5 Location 5/5  We came straight from the hospital and unknowingly made a good decision choosing this hotel, Had to wait for stitches to come off before going home.  Hotel is great, everything is fantastic. Whether it is the reception or clean rooms or house keeping, they are all extremely caring and welcoming. What made us surprise was that everyone in the hotel knew we came from the hospital and were really nice. Room service asked us if we needed to avoid or order specific food in our case. The housekeeping took time to clean our room thoroughly. Khun Lek in the house keeping is very prompt and quick. She has the potential to work twice as others and very"
"I have been there Last Friday. the weather was chill, the view was excellent, all staff was nice especially N'Max , N'Junip, N'Tangmo N'Bee and more (can't remember sorry). I am going back for sure !!!  Thx for taking care of me. Ps. I love the Air freshener scents."
Recommended afrernoon tea set here. Every desserts and cakes are good taste. Service mind with smiling faces of all staffs. Thank you Khun Go for good take care. We will come again for sure. See everyone next time.
"Room is very clean. New building. Bath room with separated toilet, shower 3 parts, bathtub which is rare to find in this area. This let me enjoy taking a bath very much. Breakfast was terrific. No con. I will definitely come back and recommend everyone to come here. No regrets."
"This is Hotel is super nice:-)!  The interior design and amenities are really great, clean and comfy as well. Their rooms are superb and innovative style.   I wiukd recommend their Tuxedo Coffee shop as well, their almond croissant was soooo goooddd!! Thank You to Khun Poo for having such a welcoming heart amd to all their staff, their men on duty from morning to evening were so kind and hospitable, they like talking to their guests which makes you feel good and at ease.   Highly recommend Hotel.   A little bit of the downside was that upon entering the lobby, there was a pretty bad smell- I think they have to check their piping."
"Was here for a conference, good new hotel, valet parking services available, good view from 9th floor, had dining as to basement, relatively good facilities, coffee break was ok, most of snacks were not veg. Anyway good location at sukumbhit"
"This is a lovely hotel with excellent service.  We stopped by for a staycation and can not say enough good things about the beauty of the hotel rooms. The staff was wonderful especially Pe, Yu and Esther.  They welcomed my friend and I and made sure that we were comfortable for the stay.  We only live a few blocks away and hope to visit again."
"1st time in this new hotel on sukhumvit, i usually stay in a 5 stars, the staff is professional, from the cleaning team to the reception, nothing to complain.I had a package through Kerry to send, one of the staff walked me around and completed everything.I will for sure come again. Thank you for this Nice stay. Mr HA"
"Spent 5 nites at Carlton Bangkok last week…. had wanted to check out the new hotel for a while beside the hotel is at a perfect location just short walks to shopping malls, restaurants and bars. I thoroughly enjoyed the stay especially for the price 😊. The dim sum at Wah Lok are simply delicious, as good as the one in Singapore if not better! I love chilling out at the Cooling Tower roof top bar. A well design comfortable roof top bar with a stunning view at night. The staffs were super friendly and helpful. Fantastic service and attitude! I also enjoyed the Tuxedo café at the lobby. It has a nice and casual ambiance. A good place to relax and enjoy a good cup of coffee in the morning…. One thing that set the hotel apart is the ever helpful and attentive staffs…. Wanted to give"
"I went to carlton hotel because I was a host mc wedding event. Before the event started, I went to rooftop because I’ve heard that the view from this hotel was nice, so I went there for some photos and yeah, the view was very nice as others mentioned about! Then I went to the pool for preparing my script and met the male staff who wear the glasses with chinese look. He was polite and explained me very clear about info of this hotel and suggested promotion at pool bar like professional so i tried  drinks as his suggestion. Its taste was awesome. Impress!!!   Wish to visit carlton again 💕"
"My wife and I had a wonderful three-week stay at the Carlton. Brand new, everything is top notch. Huge well-equipped gym, the best I’ve ever seen in a hotel.  Steam room and sauna. Room was very comfortable, amazing view. Same from the rooftop bar. But the best part of our stay was the staff, who were extremely helpful and nice, including Ning, Esther, Pe, Whan, and Yu."
"Worth it!! This word could describe everything here. You will get more than you paid. Five stars service since arrival, stunning BKK view in a very new and clean room. I think we went to all of the outlets here. The roof top bar - cooling tower (nice!!), Chinese lunch at Wah Lok, the place that you got treasure assistance manager who provided me a beyond service, truly hospitality mind. Khun Maew :) The best coffee bar of all hotels ever, Tuxedo. The signature coffee and homemade croissant were made my day so goood.  Can't remember all of your staff names but all of you are amazing. Special thanks to concierge team that organized all our requests, Khun Nuam , khun New and khun Benz. Khun Plan who farewell us during checking out.  We will come back in nearest future! ;) Ps. Your"
"Overall level of service was very impressive. Their hospitality is remarkable. We indeed enjoyed our stay here. Room was neat and tidy, bed was nicely done and very comfortable.  Nice swimming pool and well-equipped gym. Cooling Tower & Wah Lok Chinese Restaurant are not to be missed."
"Impressive service, Staff at rooftop bar is excellent friendly especially Nooni, The view is one of the best in bkk ❤️❤️ Beautiful and comfortable seating, very private, very recommended, will come back here again next time 🥰"
"Stayed here twice in the last few weeks. Hotel is brand new, beautiful and spotless. The rooms were great and had great views of downtown Bangkok. We didn't get much of a chance to try the food - due to COVID  parts of the dining areas were closed. Breakfast is ala carte for now (presumably not in the future?) and solid, as was the room service menu. Speaking of service, all staff from the porters to the concierge, cleaners to guest service were amazing. Definitely the reason we stayed twice, and definitely the reason we'll stay again. Thanks again to Esther and the rest of the CH team for making a difficult situation a pleasure."
"Nice bar ever that I have been. Cooling tower was so amazing good bar and very nice staff especially Fah Natchinee , Ramida , Mounties and cooling bar team. Love this place. Happy hour have everyday  Will come back againnnnnnnnnn"
"We had a perfect two nights here and wished we had more time here. Rooms, service, and facilities are impeccable. The food is really good and it has an excellent large gym and pool including steam room and sauna."
We really enjoyed our stay at the Carlton hotel. The hotel is brand new and very clean. The exceptional service made our stay even more enjoyable. I will definitely return to stay again. Thank you khun Nhing and khun Pe for making our check in and check out very smooth.
I had a perfect and relaxing time here. All the amenities are new and clean. Big LCD TV and very strong wi-fi. The staffs were all nice. (Thanks to Yu & Pe for the warm welcome.) I will stay here next time and recommend for every one.
"What a wonderful NEW hotel! Absolutely beautiful interior, spotlessly clean, incredible attention to detail, kind and caring staff (who literally couldn't do enough for you) and the best of all.........THE BEST VIEWS OF BANGKOK from our bedroom!  We decided to stay at this hotel because the price was so cheap for the rating of this hotel on trip advisor! It was such a treat, as I imagine when covid restrictions are lifted, this hotel will be inundated with tourism and double the price!  This hotel is  MUST if you are wanting a luxurious experience, where you truly feel pampered from the moment you enter, to the moment you leave. The location is perfect, just a 5 min walk from the ASOK BTS line, a short walk to Emporium mall and a short BTS line to all the other malls (such as"
I stayed for a short night with my family but we really happy staying there especially the service they always give you good advice for everything and very helpful Esther New Yu Pe Fai and Nuch Thanks
"I stayed twice.  The first for 1 night to evaluate the hotel, and the second time for 6 nights, while recovering from cataract surgery.    I was looking for a clean, well appointed hotel where I could recover in a safe, quiet place.  I consider house keeping and maintenance sections to be the backbone of a hotel.  Housekeeping provided the little extras (water, tea bags) that I requested.  The one maintenance problem (need to reset the A C fuse) was dealt with within 5 minutes).  The pool is long (20 to 25 meters) and clean.  The fitness center is is well equipped, with equipment not commonly found.  The meals are good.  I had room service, a sandwich at the Tuxedo Cafe, and dim sun at the Chinese restaurant.  Khun Title is the Concierge.  It was a pleasure to have the benefit"
"I travel to Bangkok frequently, and have so far been disappointed with most of the hotels in the city. The Carlton did not disappoint and I believe i have found my second home here.   The staff are all very welcoming and friendly, especially Esther at the front desk who was extremely personable and attentive. They all seemed to remember me each time I'd pop in and out despite the countless faces they must see walking through every day.  Bedrooms are very clean, showers hot, television channels excellent and the fitness centre is second to none for a hotel.  The location is great too, only locate about a 5 minute walk to Asok BTS.   I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone - business and family trips alike. I look forward to my return"
"To the point, we very much enjoyed our staycation here. The new hotel and their exceptional staff deserve a five star recommendation. From our well designed/functional hotel room to their multiple restaurant dining venues (we dined at three of them) including Wah Lok (marvelous dimsum), the rooftop Cooling Tower, and the Plate (for a lovely breakfast), we give them ALL and their staff a thumbs up. We loved the live DJ vibes at the rooftop bar.  The workout room is large and well equipped. The very large/long salt-water pool is exceptional. But foremost, as prior reviewers have shared, what stood out most were the earnest service providers from time of arrival to time of departure and at each of the dining venues (including the pool staff too). There were management/staff"
"We have stayed in a lot of hotels, but the Carlton is without doubt the best we have ever stayed in.   We opted for a Club access room for a 5 night stay and were not disappointed. Right from arrival on check in the staff were superb - they went above and beyond to help with whatever we needed.   The room was spotless with nice touches like automatic curtains over our big panoramic window, a Japanese style toilet and Nespresso machine. The bed was very comfortable with very high quality linen and the internet was lightening fast.  Only a couple of criticisms from us - the air con was so cold, even set at 26 degrees (we live in Thailand), we were freezing and had to have it turned off most of the time! There wasn't a socket in the bathroom for hair dryers (only for shavers which"
I have had special moment with Khun pakbung in CIT rooftop bar She so kind and so gentle service to me in every time when i visit .please come to join best moment with her warm welcome. Best place to waiting for sunset moment
"Very good, luxury and cozy hotel especially from Khun Charuni, front desk and her team with very warm welcome and impressive services. Food was nice with marvelous material. I'll be back there again with my friends."
"I stayed at carlton for 2 nights and it was very impressive stay for me.  Our room was so big and nice tho, bed so comfy. And a huge panoramic window in the room was fantastic!!   I liked the way everything in room were controlled by electronic control panel which is great.  Staff there were so nice and friendly. I was impressed. Would like to come back again :)   Ps. they located in the centre of bkk. Easily walk from Asoke bts station."
The overall facilities reach a good standard especially the staff. Most of staff have a very good service mind.(Shkhumvit4room’s staff K’Anuwat&K’Anchal) Other services are moderate. The snacks are good quality. 🙏
Our stay at the newly built Carlton in Bangkok exceeded all expectations. From check in and service through (both Yu and Jane were particularly helpful) the hotel staff were courteous and professional. The room was so comfortable and luxurious without being over the top or cheesy...everything is so well considered.   I really love the automatic blinds and maximum comfort beds.   Highly recommended.
"Check in was fast, and the service was prompt but friendly. Room is clean and tidy. Excellent services by Jane, Esther, Benzdy, Whan, Phan, and the rest of hotel staffs. Angel Hair Pasta with Seafood was amazing. Cooling tower, the rooftop bar is fabulous."
"The hotel is in a good location, conveniently connected to the MTR and BTS. Rooms are clean, new and comfortable. The Chinese restaurant is superb, I dined there 2 days in a row. Staff were helpful and attentive. Special thanks to Khun Suebyot, Khun Wan, Khun Japan and Khun Khun for their excellent services throughout the stay."
"This is my first time to stay in this hotel. I got warm welcome from all staffs with professional and excellent service especially reception and bellman team.   I had small party with my gang at Cooling Tower. I fell in love with that place but not only the stunning view but food and beverage was great also. And all staffs are friendly and helpful.   The room is spacious - bed and pillows are soft and comfortable.   Wah Lok (Chinese restaurant)  - The food is delicious and reasonable price.  Last but not least, the best part of this hotel is its outstanding service staff - starting from the reception staffs, bellmen, concierge, restaurant service etc. all the staffs are at your service with a smile.   Great place to make it your second home. Highly recommend it. I will"
I experienced great meal at Plate and Tuxedo Espresso Bar. My family and I felt very warm welcomed by Khun Win and Khun Preeyanart (Ying). Khun Ying provided great service for not only in-house but also outside guests. That's the reason why I made a decision to stay at this hotel next visit.
"The most I love here is a service mind staff !! Every single one I met was so fantastic. I checked in with Ms.Esther, she was so polite with nice words of speaking. I had met Ms.Jane when checked out, she was super sweet and answered my friend's questions about hotel so well. My friends like her a lot.  Dinner at Cooling Tower : my girls and I had a party up there. The food was perfect especially, Squid-Chicken BBQ was over the moon! and service from Ms.Nooni & Ms.Junif were absolutely 5 stars standard. I accidentally dropped water , Ms.Nooni took charge and cleaned up all of sudden!  Breakfast at Taxido : Croissant was fantastic !! I got warmly welcome from Ms.Pui. She so nice. I like her the most from all staff! So funny that I felt like sister to her without no reason why :D"
I had great time with my friends. Good service Good location Good facilities :)  친절한 직원들과 맛있는 음식까지 즐거운 시간이였습니다. 체크인 도와준 일본인직원이였던 Yu의 따듯한 환영으로 처음부터 기분 좋은 숙박이 되었습니다. 자동화 시스템도 인상적이였습니니다. 나중에 또 오고 싶어지는 호텔  ありがとうございました！ユウさん
"I had Staycation trip with my friends at Carlton Bangkok for 1 night. The hotel is new with COVID-19 preventive control protocol. The room is comfy, spacious. We had chance to enjoy hotel outlets as well.  Wah Lok is Cantonese restaurant - serving authentic Chinese food. All dishes are great and tasty. I love the presentation and decoration.  Cooling Tower is newly opened rooftop bar. The ambience is nice and the staff are awesome. We witnessed the sunset and really enjoyed food and drink.  Pool and Gym are located on 10FL. Gym has full function of machines and equipments. The outdoor pool is just next to the gym. We ordered happy drinks, that was a relaxing moment, enjoy my times with friends.  Thank again to K.Whan,K.Title and K.Benz from Front Office team for providing"
"My friend and I had a great stay here at Carlton Bangkok Sukhumvit. All the staff here were very friendly and helpful especially Khun Palm, Khun Art, and Khun Nuam. We spent our time only in the hotel by using all of their facilities.   Room:  The room was cozy, the bed was soft and comfy. The view from the room was spectacular.  Pool and Gym:  The gym has functional equipment with the alcohol wipes provided for sanitizing the equipment before and after use.  The pool area was nice, good for relaxing.  Restaurant:  Tuxedo Espresso Bar was perfect to chill out with your friend. They also provide grab and go breakfast, if you are in a rush. The bakery and coffee there was delicious.  Wah Lok was one of the best Chinese restaurants. The foods were appetizing. Thanks to Khun Tuk for"
"Great stay at Carlton Bangkok Sukhumvit. Feels very new and we had a great family room. My boys loved the electronic toilet :). Great views, fantastic pool. Best I have stayed at in downtown Sukhumvit.  Breakfast is good wonderful coffee, shame everything is wrapped in plastic but I sure this is due to covid restrictions. One area they should look at its getting rid of the plastic water bottles in the rooms and have glass bottles. Also remove the plastic bottles in the showers and baths.Or have refill stations for water. I believe this is now our favourite downtown place to stay now. Thanks to You, Whan, Esther, Nuam and Dy for making it a great stay."
One of the highly recommended Chinese restaurants in Bangkok. I had a chance to visit this authentic Cantonese cuisine and it gave me delectably great meal. Special thanks to Mr.Suebyos Chief Concierge for the warmest welcome.
I had lunch at Wah Lok Chinese restaurant this afternoon . There have a lot of quality menu. Tastes very good and good service from restaurant's staffs. Chefs's menu very fantastic. Specially warm welcome from Mr.Suebyos ( chief concierge). He 's very helpful high knowledge and friendly. May I Recommend a great this hotel on Sukhumvit Rd. as top hotel in Bangkok.
"Excellent service from the staffs at this hotel. It was my first time here, and It was impressive.  Special thanks to Nuam, Esther, Yu, and, Jane, Nhan for the warm greetings! They are attentive  I would love to come back and food was really nice."
Very nice Chinese Food and really service here. Definitely an awesome selection for recommending. Khun Title (Chief Concierge) really gave a warm welcome feeling to many guests upon arrival and make me feel relaxed to be here.
"It’s good impressive for great cleanliness and kind service by Yu, Egther and Jane. We were relaxing while staying at hotel. We would like to come back to stay at this hotel again. I hope keep clean and kind service."
"Great Hotel, modern and stylish room. Quiet and peaceful in the heart of Bangkok.  They propose real French croissant as if you were in France !  Whan, Peach and Nuam, were very helpful as well as the Tuxedo Espresso bar staff.   Would definitely stay again."
"My first experience at Carlton hotel Staff are very nice and helpful and the room is clean , brand new furniture and Cooling tower rooftop bar was amazing, nice view.  I would definitely pick this place again I visit Bkk."
"We stayed at the Carlton Hotel Bangkok for the 3rd time now. I actually asked my 3-year-old son where he wanted to go for the weekend. Usually, he likes trying new places, but this time he was very determined to go back to the Carlton Hotel.  This doesn't come to a surprise as the staff is great with kids. Especially Mrs Whan at the desk and Khun Win at the Tuxedo Restaurant. Those 2 really manage to be professional and are great with or son. They seem to understand that kids aren't just kids, but they want to be included in all experiences. They make our son feel welcome and feel included as a guest.   We had the afternoon delight tea for lunch and were amazed by how delicious every component was. We usually don't eat sweets as we live a keto lifestyle, but we thought we'd give"
"This is the perfect Bangkok base for the traveller with more discerning tastes. It is quite easily one of the best hotels I've stayed in.  The rooms are airy, very tastefully decorated and equipped with a really excellent smart TV and home media system. The bathroom is superbly appointed and comfortable. The lighting options in the room are extensive, which I loved, with some beautiful mood lighting that was excellent at night. The bed itself was faultless.  Every staff member I interacted with was pleasant, accommodating and smiling. In particular Namwhan, Yu and Esther all left an excellent lasting impression. I really felt like a VIP during my stay. The breakfast was served unlimited but a la carte, and everything was fresh and delicious. The coffee was excellent and the"
"In my opinion,this is one of the best 5-star hotels I've stayed that i really like it.  The hotel had provided me the best and excellent service. All the staffs are always friendly and helpful, taking care like you are an important member of a family with high service mind. The room was great , clean, beautiful,stylish and comfortable, with a very good-smart home system and beautiful city view. The hotel is located in the heart of Bangkok, so it is so convinient to get to all shopping malls.  The hotel also provides 24-hour fitness center. The food was delicious ,clean and good in quality , I surely  recommend this hotel."
"This is my second time to stay in this new hotel. The young team here is impressive. Upon arrival, I was welcomed by Khun Dy and Khun Benz who were so kind to my 7-month-old son. The receptionists were friendly, and my appreciation goes specifically to Khun Jane who took care of the check in as she was so attentive. After checking in, we went to have dinner at Tuxedo Bar. The beef bourguignon was top notch, and the bar staff, Regade was so polite.   The hotel is baby friendly, there was enough space beside the luggage rack to put the baby trolley in the room, and they were kind enough to provide not only the baby cot but also a baby bottle sterilizer and a small baby bathtub.   The view from our room on 23rd floor was stunning. This new luxury hotel is definitely worth a try."
Coffee and Marble cake are absolutely great and want to visit again. All the staffs are really attentive and smile  Esther Korean staff is really kind  Hotel looks so modern and chill  One of the best hotel in Sukhumvit area

"The Carlton Bangkok is a very nice hotel!    I frequent their lobby lounge (Tuxedo) at least three times a week.  It is so bright, calm, and peaceful--and the coffee is great!  The staff are also excellent: very professional and efficient.  Highly recommended!"
"Establishing itself as one of the Bangkok’s most luxurious boltholes is Carlton Hotel Bangkok Sukhumvit, a five-star retreat centrally located in the heart of the city’s financial district. Opened in 2020, the variety of rooms flagship promises a blend of style, serenity and comfort.  And it delivers. Its magnificence is made clear from the second I enter the lobby. A sweeping & spacious floorplan; classic yet contemporary design features and, most resonant, a feeling of familial hospitality which competitors often struggle to achieve.   Having arrived with city shrouded in grey, the dazzling interior design is a welcome sight, and thankfully, it’s in no short supply. As I’m escorted to my room by one of Carlton’s expertly-trained team members, I can’t help but notice that no"
"Staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. They were also very flexible and understanding when I wanted to change my check out time. The room was satisfying and spacious with a great view of the city and swimming pool. My boyfriend asked something special for my birthday at the bar by the swimming pool and they surprised me with a cutie coconut ice cream. We had an amazing experience here before go back to Belgium and we would love to come back in the future :)"

Had my first visit to this new hotel and least to say I was not disappointed in the slightest! Upon arrival we had a few cocktails and Tuxedo bar and then in the evening we had the most amazing dinner in the restaurant. The seleciton of food and drinks on offer were definitely of a 5* hotel. On top of that the room was absolutely beautiful  and clean.  The next morning we had a dip and swim in their amazing pool.  There are absolutely no complaints and I would highly recommend to anyone staying in Bangkok!

"I went to have dinner at Plate restaurant with my family last week. We ordered Salmon Laab, Pizza, and Angel Hair Olio with Bacon. All of them are so delicious. We also received the great complimentary cocktails. In addition to the food, the service at this hotel is amazing with outstanding and warm welcome from from Khun Pui, Khun Win, Khun Toy, Khun Mint, Khun Bom and the chef team. I will definitely go there again !!"
"This newly constructed hotel is superb. It’s well positioned in a part of town where there are loads of restaurants, coffee shops and massage places. There’s a real city feel and yet the hotel has a calm, stylish and welcoming feel to it. Staff greet you wherever you go and the rooms are immaculate. The Tuxedo bar in the lobby area has the best coffee, great sparkling wine and incredible classic and iconic pastries. I believe they are made on-site in their very own pristine open kitchen. You can actually view the pastry chefs at work!"

We got the warmth welcome from restaurant team (Khun Pui, Khun Win, Khun Toy, Khun Mint, and Khun Bom) including escorted us to the reserved table.  The table is decorated by candle which is quite romantic and the restaurant is so elegance and well-prepared.  The food is tasted and diversity, I cannot describe all of that but you must put this restaurant in your bucket list. Thank you to Khun Jim and kitchen team.  The “Blueberry Cheesecake” from Chef Den and his team is also amazing, texture is quite excellent which mixed by the best quality ingredient.  The price is reasonable base on those fantastic main dish, side dish, dessert and baverage. Not to mention, the surprise “complimentary Cocktail"
