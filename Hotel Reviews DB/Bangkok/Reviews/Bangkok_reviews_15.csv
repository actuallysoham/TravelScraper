"Without  kind  assistance of the hotel's staff to help us to  stay through ""Travel Together Programme"" , at this Swissotel, we would not be able to stay in this hotel last week. Our experience with this hotel was exceptional excellent in every aspects. We hope to come back again.  Thank you again for all of your kind services."
"I used this place to hole an academic conference for 2 nights. The event had people who came from different part of the country. It led to have so many things to manage. However, all of hotel staff understood circumstances and tried to help us. I would like to thank you all of staff, especially K' Cake and K' Milk, who were nice and helpful. They are super supportive. We will definitely go back again if we think about a place to have a conference."
We book the room and add special request for birthday celebration > we‚Äôve got birthday cake and flower bouquet.  They upgrade the bigger room for us. We feel surprised and have a great day here. Very comfy bed that makes a good sleep. Large toilet and bathtub. Good complimentary. The staffs are very nice and have service mind. We appreciate your service and care.  Thank you
If you are the one who find some perfect place to hold the wedding ceremony. Swissotel Ratchada is the best choice for you. Mr. Team who is a staff manager really kind and friendly.

"Strongly recommended if you're looking for a 5 stars hotel next to MRT line. The hotel is newly renovated. The room is very nice and spacious. Their Japanese restaurant ""Takumi"" is the best Japanese buffet in town. The services are excellent. I saw everyone are helping each other to provide the best services to customer. Don't miss to stay here."
"Good location  near mrt , good service, worth the money ,staff so nice and helpful ,room was big and awesome clean and nice view , restaurant very tasty also breakfast not much choice but its really good and understandable"
I really enjoyed the room at the swiss hotel. the breakfast was great as well. the rooms were spacious and everything seemed okay. One thing that stood out was that we were not greeted at the door. or the hotel did not have Valet parking or the greet at the car. so it was just a little confusing of what to do. we also had bags. so it was just a little difficult there.
"Nice hotel with easy traffic link , huge place with various facilities , Most Important thing is great and nice services everywhere inside this hotel , very safe measurement during the COVICD19 special timing zone.."
"Highly recommended All staff here was very friendly and warmed welcome. The room was very clean, comfortable, and nice. The Chinese restaurant was highly appreciated both service and food. Although breakfast was bit busy, but easy to understand for the situation. Takumi was very delicious. Finally, I was exceedingly appreciated also recommended. Spacial thank for all staffs, especially, Khun Juthamas from Loong Fong, Khun Somchai and Khun Patcharaporn from Takumi."
"You can stay here and go to any where very convenient because this hotel is in downtown such as Rama 9, Siam, Sukumvit, silom, etc. There is not far from underground. Youcan take the underground and continue with the sky train to anywhere in Bangkok."
"Very clean room with very polite staffs. The toilets tiles are a little slippery but everything else is wonderful. Good location, very accessible and convenience. We had a great time and really enjoy our stay."
"I have wedding ceremony on december 2020 Swissotel ratchada is good service and fantastic place for your vacation and ceremony event.  Swissotel ratchada team is support all time your requested.   Their Facility is completely have japan buffet, Fitness , pool."
"I always prefer to stay at Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada. I‚Äôve been there often due to the business works. I do have a lot of choices to choose to stay near the office, yet I still choose Swissotel because of Sales Nuk. She is always there to support me when I have any problems, whether hotels or personal, or whether how small it is. She takes care of every single points and every details. She knows and remembers what I like to drink, to eat, she always provide me the packages that she think will suit with me. I really appreciate what she has done for me. In my opinion, she is very energetic, motivated, and she is caring me, other customers and hotels like one of her family. Also, she is there to support me for 2 years, but her services never stop or decrease. I‚Äôm thankful for this"
It was wonderful moment at Swissotel Bangkok. Everything was excellent. The manager and staff were fantastic with a very professional service. They took so good care of our family. The service was exceptional. We received a very warm hospitality. We had a great time having delectable food. We were so happy and thank you for making our day so memorable.¬†Swissotel Bangkok is highly recommended.
"It was our 1st time staying at Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada since I got a good deal from travel fair. Service was excellent and beyond expectation. Staff were being friendly and attentive.   Besides a warm welcome upon arrival, we were also surprised to get delicious 'Dim Sum' as a welcome set.  Also, got a room upgrade to Suite. The decoration might not quite modern, but cozy and comfortable.   Our dinner at Takumi Japanese Restaurant was well-arranged since we made a room reservation through hotel official line which is quite convenient. Showing their concern and acknowledgement of the voucher condition we used."
"Excellent service, good location  and good meals. We were satisfied with all service and facilities of the hotel. It might be better if the hotel provides notepad and pen or pencil. We couldn't find any in our room."
"It was very great staying at this hotel again after Covid situation even for one night stay.  An always warm welcome from hotel staff. Clean and hygienic environment.  Thanks for the safety kit :masks, alcohol spray and alcohol wipers in the room. Overall was good and I will come back again."
"We had set up a meeting there and have wonderful support from staff team since the night before till the event day. Room was well-prepared with well-trained staff and great taste of snack and coffee. Great location near MRT, another good choice for meeting location near Ratchada."
"Hotel is located in Ratchada road, less than 100 meters walk to subway station. It' elegant old fashion hotel which is a part of mix venue and hotel is focus on groups.  Room is ok , new decorate, but bathroom has no bidet shower.   Japanese buffet at Takumi is very good  The most disappoint is breakfast, I have it on 14 Nov on 0800 am where nobody there. Hotel serve as a la carte due to less guest. But staff are not attentive, they keep talking to each other. I have to call for coffee, and have to get the sauce basket from the selves by myself. The quality is also not good, cold bacon, sausage.   Another thing is swimming pool, the hotel allow guest to use maximum 2 ppl per hour, you need to make reservation in advance. It will be good if staff inform us upon check in, but"
"My family got pleasant stay in this hotel. The hotel is an old fashion structure and design. But with hotel renovation in 2019. I think hotel offer a good value for all. The room (except bathroom) is nice with big bay window. The service is great. I had Weekend Lunch Buffet in their Chinese restaurant which was great. Breakfast there is on par.   Location is good, 80 m. from MRT HuayKwang.   All in all with the room rate that is affordable. I recommend this hotel for all esp. for Family and Business purpose."
"Hotel staff are great & full of service mind. Breakfast are great and many of choices, room is very cleanliness, room service is very good, Front desk & Receptionist staff are very nice & friendly plus full of services mind. We must come to stay at this hotel again."
Good location connect with MRT huakwang station easy to travel around Bangkok. Lobby was grand and look nice features with a luxury decoration. Coffee shop Deli Swiss very nice Staffs are friendly and helpful Nicky always smile and very kind. I wish to come back again for sure.
"First time I came here. I just came to waiting my friend there. And while I'm waiting I went to Deli Swiss to got one ham cheese croisant. It was very nice.  And I would like to say thank you for Nikky. She gave me a good sevice, help me to taking picture. And for sure I will come back again."
"The hotel is located about 30 mins away from the International Airport . There is a Hindu Temple within walking distance and Siam Niramat  is nearby . You can take the MRT train to nearby malls ,etc . The hotel has huge rooms and are well furnished and stocked with a mini bar ,etc . They have a nice swimming pool and gym with separate male and female saunas . There is also a nice spa and bars and restaurants in the hotel . I tried the buffet lunch which had a huge International spread . The staff are very kind and helpful , right from the G.M. to the bellboy ."
"The rooms are very spacious, clean and well maintained. The maid service is perfect. I felt very wellcome, when I arrived by taxi and because I am a regular guest, I could do the check-In in a private surrounding on floor 21, next to the Executive Club Lounge. I just had to do 1 signature, because all the paperwork was already prepaired and in addition I got an upgrade for a Junior Suite. What a perfect start into my holidays.   In my Junior Suite everything needed was already there, not to mention all the amneties and especially the coffee machine from Nespresso. I did not miss any artikel in the room, so what do I want more?  If you book an Executive room or higher, then you get access to the Executive Lounge on floor 21, what means everything is included in the room rate and"
"Great service and location, 2min to 7/11 and 10mims to central plaza by taxi.Service is good here, the gym is quiet large.The staff named chatree is really nice and enthusiastic.Will choose this hotel next timeüëç"
"Location is not very special, unless you have business offices nearby.  The hotel nice and comfy, good pool, gym is very nice too. No park to jog in the morning, although reception was very helpful to give me a map of the neighborhood with several routes and various distances to jog. Break fast was nice. There is a Chinese and a Japanese restaurants in the hotel, which are of good quality and both offer a fixed price buffet. The Japanese place was more casual and hence busier, so not all the dishes came that I ordered. Beware that beer is very expense vs food and your dinner price can double quickly with just a couple of beers."
"First time at Swissotel Ratchada, seven days. We experienced real Thai hospitality at this very high class hotel! The staff at reception, lobby, 204 Lobby Bar, 204 Bistro, house keeping, gym and security was really friendly, polite and attentive.  Our spacious executive room was newly renovated, stylish and clean. Bed was too hard for me, but everything else was very good.  Breakfast (a lot of cold and hot food) was at Bistro 204 and all the other Exe Lounge services were at 204 Lobby Bar; afternoon coffee and evening canap√©s and drinks. We had several lunch at 204 Bistro, tasty ala carte Thai food and also huge lunch buffet.  Big pool and really large and spacious FITStudio gym.  Location near MRT/metro station is very good (100 meters), easy to go around Bangkok and connect to"
Finest Experience Ever..üíï It ‚Äòs very convenience with two minutes walking to MRT.. Suit..very nice restaurant .. Especially professional and cordial on Executive Lounge 21st F... Thank youü•∞üòé  We come back again.
"It is always great to stay in Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada hotel. It has great ambient, convenience location with nearby MRT station. Most importantly, great reception with great staffs (Ms Sommon, Ms Salinee, Ms Angsoma). Always smiling and always addressing with my personal name. After each stay, always looking forward to return. The hotel is also value for money."
"Good location , well maintained property, friendly staff. Good bedding, up to OK standard breakfast, lift lobby is managed in good order of use, parking facility is good, nice noise block on room windows."
"I had high expectations and the hotel over delivered. We are platinum Accor and when we booked, 3 months prior we contacted Khun Frank who offered us an early check in. We stayed for 6 nights. Not only did we have an amazing check in experience by Songkran and Dutsadee, but the notes were in the system, we were welcomed and had a room upgrade - a fantastic wow to the start of our stay. It was a pleasure to meet Frank later in our stay - a true ambassador for the hotel. Our room was really quiet and peaceful and our cleaner Sathima always seemed to be able to clean our room whilst we were at breakfast - marvellous. There was also a nightly turndown service. We ate breakfast in the lounge which was so peaceful and relaxing.  The evening cocktails and canap√©s were also great and we"
"Last year I wrote a glowing review of Swissotel Bangkok and I did not feel the need to provide an update until things changed.  Unfortunately I must now report on significant cutbacks at this hotel regarding room Platinum upgrades and happy hour.  Service remains great and breakfast in the lounge is still top notch but going forward my enthusiasm is more tempered about returning.  In the past I booked the Executive Suite and received a one-category upgrade to the Crest Suite as Accor Platinum.  For this stay I again booked the Exec Suite and I saw online that the vast majority of room types were available at time of check-in including the Crest Suite, therefore I was surprised to find out at the front desk that we were not getting upgraded.  Staff indicated that they no longer"
"Very good and friendly hotel since last time I satyed here is more than 10 years before.  Old building but new renovated in 2 years. All staff are very friendly and kind.  I arrived about 2am and 3 staff were expected me for check in.  The executive lounge is very good in 21st floor for breakfast, tea time and happy hour.  I enjoyed the breakfast every day and last night happy hour.  The lady (sorry forgot the name) in lounge is very nice and provide efficent service. ( have to thanks to her).   Mr. Ithidaj Rajatabhothi (director of guest experience) accomany me to down stair on the check out date and explain me some issue about the hotel.  Hotel put me in a suite due to the Diamond card. It is nice and spacious, free 3 pieces landary every day which is good in Thailand.  Only"
Always good service here. Executive breakfast room is a favoutite of ours. Good food selection. Love happy hour treats and drinks. This is the place we go to when we want a good rest and peace. Our lives are hectic and here is the remedy.
I stayed at swissotel radchada for 4 nights and it was a terrific experience. the service and support was great and i would like to single out K. Sommon for praise.Thank you so much for taking care of me and my family.
Fitness centers are especially good for people who love fitness.  The service is very thoughtful.  The room is clean and tidy  I especially like the smell of the lobby.  No Queen Room Only Double Bed Room The receptionist gave me extra money to order a more luxurious room I accepted.
"Very good service, specifically naming Salinee. Warm, attentive to detail and made me feel very welcome. Thank you! The stay at the hotel was excellent. Food, d√©cor and room were great. Overall the staff are very helpful."
"Swissotel on Ratchada was fantastic. Our bell boy Prassit was a great help. He got us a cab for all day, it was cheaper than getting a taxi all day. Although they spoke very little English but we understood each other. All the staff's were extremely friendly. The restaurants that was recommended were great, especially the local food vendors at night markets. Definitely it's a place I recommend & return."
I'm most pleased with the welcome drink and the excellent service provided by the duty manager. The Conceirge services were excellent as well. Room and amenities were out of my expectations. Including the amazing greetings and decoration that were presented on our bed! Welcome drinks were amazing as well.   Totally amazing experience that exceeded my expectations even though I had expected a 5 star experience in the first place.
"Wonderful and sincere service, all the hotel staff should their sincerely in serving the guests. I would like to express my heartily thank to all the staff at the 21/F (executives floor) especially to Ms Salineee.  Angsuma and Jamieyi"
"I was completely satisfied with my stay. I was there for 9 nights and was pampered like a king. Everything was clean, where ever i looked at. But best of all are the very heartly employees, starting from the door opener to the checkin-personal, the maid service, the laundry service and especially the employees in the lounge (Chane / Min / Fang and also Saizi). I felt home all the time."
I always feel home when I came to stay at this hotel because the staff Ms. Nikki and Ms. Zaizy very kind and cute. Very fantastic event I got chocolate cake for surprise I feel very appreciated. I will come to stay here forever. Dont miss to stay at Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada. The room is very good and I have a good sleep here.
Nice hotel located near subway station very easy to travel. Hotel is very clean and the bed confortable. Ms. Nikki is very kind she provide good room with smoke room. I will come to stay at Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada again.
"This was our second trip to Bangkok for dental work and we decided to stay in The Swisshotel.  What a find!  The rooms are comfortable, including the beds.  The staff are second to none.  Nothing is too much trouble. From the moment we left our taxi, and were met by the doorman and his staff, we knew we had chosen the right hotel. Our 'meet and greet' team were so happy to see us and tend to our needs that we felt at home straight away. When we needed a taxi, it was there.  If we were negotiating the road outside, a 'traffic' officer escorted us to safety.  Unbelievable. The check-in staff were efficient and friendly and the staff at the International Buffet and A-la-cart were fantastic. We dined there most days and found everyone from the Food and Beverage Manager, to the Head"
"I have stayed at the Swissotel Ratchada several times over the past year while on business in Bangkok. The lobby staff, concierge staff and staff on the executive floors all go out of their way to make one feel special and welcome. Their attentiveness makes each stay a pleasure. In particular I have had a number of dealings with Salinee who works on the executive floor. Her service and attention to detail is outstanding and for that she needs a special mention."
"Wonderful service and all the staff at the Executive floor have done an excellent job which let me repeat staying in Swissotel. I have stayed at Swissotel for more than 9 years, they could maintain the same high service standard. Well done."
"I have been using the hotel for business trips. It has become home from home. Staff are friendly, and service is excellent. The gym is brilliant, with good equipment and also a studio. Room is comfortable."
"This is to say that a better service and treatment that I received at Swissotel LeConcorde BKK is probably very difficult to match!  My great thanks go to the Executive Floor ; Salinee  Sommon, Chane, Mint snd Fang - you geally took such good care of me!  See you soon again!  Pauli Kujala"
"The facilities are good, and the location is very convenient for us. Just 2 min Walking from MRT station and the hotel is on the main road so very easy for the cab drivers to locates. Breakfast Menu is having wide variety. Wifi GYM and pool facilities are excellent."
I travel a lot! The Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada is now one of my favourites. Good position in Bangkok nice rooms and amazing staff. I am fortunate that I got to use the Executive Lounge and all of the Staff are genuinely kind and extremely professional. I was also lucky enough to have Salinee look after me on most of my visits to the Lounge. Salinee is a person Accor should look after. Strongly recommend the hotel.
"Stayed for 3 nights and buffet breakfast included. Excellent services, good location and wide spread buffet breakfast selection. Room size spacious with comfortable king bed/double bed and shower and tub separated."
"Stayed for 2 nights and buffet breakfast included. Excellent services, good location and wide spread buffet breakfast selection. Room size spacious with comfortable king bed/double bed and shower and tub separated"
"Everything was OK:a  large and quiet room,excellent clean service, a nice swimming pool, a well equipped fitness room, choice of 3 restaurant, fast checkin and check out .A metro station near the hotel"
Very well located. Metro is adjacent. Many malls are nearby. We chose for the location and logistics and were very happy. Rooms are a bit dated and require contemporary interiors. Breakfast spread is sufficient but not extensive.
"The Swissotel Bangkok Ratchada must have been a very glamorous hotel in its heyday. It has amenities that back in the 90s must have very much impressed its guests: a centralized control for lighting, air conditioning, and radio; a 'Please wait' button next to the toilet to politely ask visitors for patience in case you were thus engaged; and a hi-fi sound system complete with CD and tape players.  The vintage feel, however, extends to the rest of the facilities - carpets and upholstery are tired and stained, the in-room air conditioning is noisy with an ineffective thermostat (freezing when on, sweltering when off, neither bearing any link with the temperature setting), and like the rings of a tree-trunk, you can probably date the fixtures through the layers of crusted dust. The"
"Swissotel has always made my stay so comfortable and pleasant right from the moment you made your room reservation and all the way to the day you check out. The personal touch right from the concierge, check in both at the ground floor and the executive floor.  Team members at the Executive Lounge, Salenee always made a good start during breakfast and I will always get my perfect soft boil egg, Singapore style as they called it. Wide choice during breakfast.  Swissotel is so comfortable with the room well ready for you to rest after work. Great location to travel by MRT and nearby dinning and shopping within walking distance. Thank you all and will sure to come back again."
"always feel the privilege of staying in Swissotel Bangkok with great hospitality from all the staff in the hotel. warm greeting from everyone there - bell boy, reception, lobby staff, staff at executive lounge. always being well taken care of and accommodate all my needs and requirement."
I really liked the customer-oriented service of the hotel and amazing breakfast selection.  The location is nice and there is a MRT station right next to the hotel which connects you to popular nearby locations. I went to the Rama9 and train market.
A very special thank to wiser thongrit and assistant manager nitcharasmi nithkospong and the person's who clean room 1516 and every one else hotel's around the world can learn a lot from you guys mr. Cash
"Great conference rooms, great food, great service!  Venue rooms are grand, complete with complete amenities - sound system, stage, projectors. I enjoyed most the food, especially our buffet lunch - an array of Thai and other asian foods. Must-try ice cream --- durian, lychee, taro, and Thai milk tea flavors!!!"
"This hotel has the most friendly staff I have ever encountered. The male staff assisting me during my checkin is very pleasant, always smiling and very accomodating...he gave me a bonus, which is a room located at a high floor with a very nice view!!! The room is well kept, clean and spacious. They have welcome drinks for everyone which I think is very nice! The breakfast is plenty and the buffet lunch is AWESOME! This is a recommended hotel."
"I have spend a week is Swissotel Bangkok, during my last business trip to Th. The quality of the rooms is good, rooms spacious and comfy. The only minus, was aged bathroom. Breakfast was a big plus, best kimchi I have tried in my life.  Good central location, is also a plus if you are going to BKK for business reasons."
This is the best place and convenient to meeting  Near with MRT just walk 3 min. But buffet is simple  Khun Jitmanas is very expertly service.she gave the best service and take care everything that you want.
"Swiss welcome on arrival and a perfect lounge servixce by Salinee snd Team. Very quiet relaxing lounge as well for workwth even Swiss cheeses. Close to Huai Khwang MRT station so easy access to all places in BKK. As well close to The Street, a nice shopping centre."
"It has the best service for money, you basically can used this lounge for your meeting and work provided you book for executive room.  Swissotel is also cain of Accor group and this also allowed accumulates points for your stay."
Stayed for two nights while my husband attended an event. Used the gym and pool. Great gym facilities looking on to pool area. Our room was spacious and fully stocked with any amenity you could wish for. Staff were friendly and extremely helpful. On the BTS so getting in to the heart of town is easy. Would recommend
"The food service and quality check is exceptional in this hotel  The food is check and tasted in detail every morning by the F&B Head and the chef  I would like to point on on the Punlop K , Which is the Executive Chef there ....His service and care and customer service is fantastic"
We do seminar and run grand dinner here. Hotel function team is excellent services. They support every single request and stand by all time. Never regret for this place. We deal annual seminar package  and the service quality always supreme. Recommend this place !!!
Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Swisshotel.  Excellent service from the staff across the board and especially touched by the personal touch and friendliness of the staff.  Imagine my surprise at the birthday cake. :)   The hotel is in an excellent location and it was easy to get around.  The room and bathroom are spacious.
"Went there for a business trip and out of the 8 of us who were travelling, four of us got food poisoning. It was after the lunch buffet. Approx 3 hours after lunch I immediately had very bad diarrhoea, followed by massive vomiting approx 5 hours after lunch. My friends then got diarrhoea and vomitting approx 7 hours after lunch. Same symptoms like mine.  Beware when eating at the hotel buffet, they are definitely not clean. We are very certain it's from the buffet as we only ate in the hotel for breakfast & lunch as we had meetings from 9am onwards."
"Wow! It was an elite experience staying at Swissotel. No matter what, from step one like opening the entrance door and the check out experience everything was just beyond the service level! It was so awesome to be here. The staff, the food, the room service, the ambience, the feel was really amazing!  I also have would like to add the overwhelming experience at the reception. Met wonderful attendant Boonnapa and her colleagues. They were all pretty awesome!"
"This hotel is well managed, with friendly and efficient service. Rooms are spacious and clean, with large bathrooms. The gym is really very good. The location is convenient for airports and BRT. It is always enjoyable to stay here for a day or two."
"My stay was so overwhelming, great service and cooperative staff. The room was so clean and the services were nice. The breakfast buffet had a lot of variety. It will be my first choice if I ever come to Bangkok again"
This place can use some improvement. Location is okay and customer service is excellent. Some details needed in cleaning the air conditioning as it was dusty. Food nearby is easily accessible and would come back if they address air conditioning issue.
Stay 3 nights at Swissotel. The bath tub with independent shower room is wonderful. The location is good for me. Less trafic and convenient for shopping. Will be back to the same in my next visit Bangkok.
Excellent service and clean rooms at this Hotel to stay in. Staff are very polite and helpful. Would recommend to anyone. Next to MTR rail system and Taxis instantly. I have stayed here 4 times now and continue to do do in future..

"Amazing experience, good rooms good food good service every thing is good. They gave me a good city view. Specialy if you are a couple take a city view room you will love staying in the same room. Breakfast was as per my taste it was good"
"What a magnificent property with exceptional service From the moment I stepped out of the taxi to the moment I left the staff at the Swissotel treated us like a kings. Staff goes above and beyond but never cloying, spacious gym, clean pool, generous breakfast Everything about this hotel is excellent from the check-in to the hospitality and finally the check-out. Special thanks to front office team and the duty manager there who made our experience top"
"Good location (to Ari/Ratchada/Silom via train area). Wifi is okay but not intelligent, not smooth access. Breakfast in Lounge better than in the Lobby. Fitness centre closes too early. Executive Lounge staff is great. Takumi Japanese restaurant is good.  Loong Foong is okay and more authentic than most Thai-Chinese restaurants for dimsum.    Good value for money if you are Accor Plus member. Use train to get around the heavy traffic around the hotel during peak hours.  Grab is essential App if you want to use private car hire/taxi during offpeak hours or to the airport"
"One of my favorite hotel for my events, its been almost more than 7 years and i have all my events at this hotel,  Great Location and Well managed Hotel. All of the staff are extremely helpful and very professional in handling events, I am totally impressed and personally i would like to thank Ms Milk, Ms Yui, & Ms Nui, and all the teams. Its all because of them makes me comeback to them for all my events. I would recommend this Hotel for events or Holiday ....Keep on üëçüëè"
"Travelling in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand on an intense business trip for about 3 weeks with final stop at Bangkok. Unfortunately, with the combo of continuous 4 hours sleep time per night, high temp and humidity (very different than northwest of the US), I got soar throat with fever yesterday. After knowing my sickness, the hotel staff assisted with local doctor referrals. Even nicely, I came back to room today and found a nice ‚ÄúGetting Well Soon‚Äù flower basket with greeting card from guest service manager Sommon Phothung, 8 complimentary bottle water which happens to match the local doctor‚Äôs recommendation, and extra tissue paper box. I am totally impressed by the high quality of the service of Swissotel Bangkok treating a non-status member customer. Will for sure stay"
"Great area, well connected to airports and Mo Chit bus station offering a mix of modern and old Bangkok. Well managed Hotel. Courtesy and patience from all the staff with excellent communication skills in both English and Chinese. High quality breakfast. Will be back on my next visits to Bangkok"
One of my favorite hotel for business travel. Good gym facilities and pool. Good breakfast spread to cater to different taste.  Their theme to focus on health and wellness appeals business traveler like me.
"Was planned on very short notice, but everything went as smooth as could be.  All of the staff was extremely helpful and made me feel privileged. The staff in the executive lounge was fantastic and was right there whenever I needed anything."
"Spacious room with a great view for very affordable price. Great amenities like a big gym a fabolous spa and big outdoor pool. We enjoyed great meals especially the Sunday brunch and the Japanese bufett dinner, where the food is brought to your table even including goose liver. Over all very recommendable."
"Excellent stay at the Swissotel üëç Staff is very friendly and customer oriented, up to the reputation of the Thai People.  My room was very spacious, modern style, well equipped, and clean...and with a stunning view over the Bankok skyline (was on 14th floor,  room #1420).  A very good choice of in-house restaurants, Tha√Ø, Chinese, and Japanese, which will give you a taste of the whole Asia in one pit stop. Breakfast is top, diverse and allows you to discover the Asian food culture while still offering a very good occidental alternative to the least adventurous of us üòá  Furthermore, the hotel is very well located:  üëâa metro station at walking distance,  üëâthe Emmanuelle salon right across the street (one of the must-see's of Bangkok),  üëâthe Train Night Market 1 metro station"
"It's our first time to stay here. We like the room very much.It's pretty spacious and clean. We enjoyed our stay with your hotel. Thanks for the house keeper,K.Apichaya, who took care our room and Front Desk Team. Especially, K.Nikki and K.Oil for your excellent service! Last but not least, Thank you to those friendly bellmen who always offering help with our luggages. Keep up the good work!"
"We have enjoyed our stay here enormously. The location is 3 mins walk yo a central railway. The rooms are up to date, clean and very comfortable with fine threaded soft sheets and excellent water pressure and a large tv. In house movies would be a fine addition to the movie channel. The breakfast buffet and friendly staff are always a fine start to the day. Most staff speak English and some are quite fluent which is especially helpful when needing assistance. The gym is very well equipped with machines, seperate male and female  Saunas, pool and a staff member to assist if help is needed. For me personally, I have enjoyed the kindness of the staff the most of all the fine features and look forward to our return."
Stayed at this hotel numerous times - each time the level of customer service is outstanding. Attention to making guests feel 'at home' is so appreciated.  The hotel services from restaurants to cafe to of course spa is on point.  The gym is well above the regular 5 star counter parts.
"Whilst not centrally located to the city, the Swissotel was a lovely place to stay at.  The Executive Lounge in particular exceeded our expectations by providing amazing canapes and even a chef preparing and cooking Sumai in the lounge.  We would definitely look at staying there again."
"Very Comfort sleeping and good location for transportation. All staffs are very friendly and welcome you warmly.  Japanese food restaurant Takumi is very delicious, including 204 bar recommendation drink 'Swiss welcome tea'"
"I really loved the location of the hotel. it's just a minuet walk to the subway station then you can take the train to any attraction in Bangkok.  Don't forget to join the hotel executive lounge, especially the evening happy hour. I loved all the food, snack and drink there. The meal list, the quality and the service were above my expectation. If the staff were trained to serve the simple classic cocktail drink, it will be more perfect."
