"I stayed at Hotel Verve for two nights and found it most pleasant. The hotel overall was very nice, clean and modern. The room was spacious enough and comfortably furnished. The bath tub was huge which made the feeling of nice holiday so much stronger. Close to high end restaurants, bars and shopping if that's what one is looking for, but also close to metro to go someplace else as Sukhumvit is maybe not the most interesting area when looking for cultural or historical experiences. Service was great! Only downside was the breakfast which was rather dull with few options and not reaching my expectations of a more high end hotel."
Loving the place as the room is nice and well equipped  I prefer the breakfast there are choices i can choose.  The staff at front desk are friendly and they are so helpful with limousine and taxi service  I will be back again next time.
The hotel is nice and its suitable for sleepover party i guess i will come back again  The breakfast is good there are choices from japanese to western  My friends and i will come back here soon again..
"the room is nice and modern i like the usb outlet at the bedside its easy for me to work. the breakfast is good and the staff are freindly.  it is also easy to travel around by public transportation, good fot the solo"
We chose Bangkok for our new year destination as we love the Thai hospitality The hotel is new and the staff are friendly. The location is closed to BTS plus we can reach the city center easily Would be great if we could have had longer time here
We like the spacious room and environment around. At the end of the road theres also donki my girl likes it  We will come bck here again to explore round as the spot is near BTS we recommend you to rest here
"The time I spent here with my friends were great, apart not having swimming pool. We enjoy the restaurants around here and the bus is closed I guess it's a good location in Bangkok. The restaurant can host a small party."
Im here for my business talk in bangkok and i choose here because of the location very easy to travel  The breakfast have not so many choices but the taste is good. The room is spacious and well equippedüçû i will come back here again for sure
I guess travelling in bangkok is easy staying here as its closed to public transportation but the hotel itself is hidden behind the nikko hotel. By the way the area got enough nightlife to enjoy for solo itd be fun to make new friends and discover the area
"The best part of this hotel for me was the promotion they had with a late check out of 10pm. Since my flight leaving Bangkok was a little after midnight, having such a late check out worked out perfectly. The staff here is friendly and helpful, the rooms were clean and the Japanese bbq restaurant downstairs is delicious. The location in Bangkok is also pretty central to a lot so that was good as well.  Fyi, when you enter the rooms, you will have to step up a little bit so it's prolly not too wheelchair friendly."
"I stayed here for one night at the start of my trip and plan to book again for when I get back to Bangkok on my way home. The hotel is conveniently located, is nice and clean, and has good size rooms. Importantly it‚Äôs close to the train and interesting places to eat."
"Good price good location very close to a sky train if you don‚Äôt want to stay in the center of the city I would like to recommend this area. The room is really new and clean, good staff service and breakfast was is good."
If you like japanese food you‚Äôll like it here  There are many choices available and you dont have to go far to get good one  Close to BTS its easy to travel around. My girl and i will come back here again for sure
Everything was good.  Check-in was good and fast. The room was good. Breaskfast was exceptonal for me as I love Japanese style breakfast. The staff are all very helpful.  The area outside is full of massage places as well as food places.  The only things that could be improved: 1- location : taxi direction is not easy: it will be easier to just say nikko hotel as they share the same drive in and location. Verve is just opposite Nikko   2- Air con :the aircon cools slowly and the controls are often loose.
"Very clean and very good service overall. Convenient nearby eateries. Near to subway BTS. Many good Japanese restaurants along the main road. Not too near city central, hence convenient for moving around. Highly recommended."
"Got invited to stop by one of my partners' event in the nearby hotel. Only 2 nights, the hotel looks quite classick, there is a 7-11 approx 5 min walking. The MRT station is 10 min. I felt its great. I may come again!"
We just checked in with ease in less than 5 minutes at the reception. The room was prepared the way we asked for with an extra bed for our 5 years old son. The room is super clean with all necessary amenities. We are fans of Panpuri products so we gave two thumbs up for Hotel Verve. The towels are pretty new and super soft. Bed was comfortably firm with good pillow selections. We will try the breakfast tomorrow which was highly recommended by many of our friends. If we have time we will do another review on breakfast.
"We decided to enjoy the loy krathong activity in Bangkok so checking in this hotel is the answer as the hotel is located in Thonglor - center of town. The room is very nice and super clean and new. Amenities are nice, the scent of soap is so refreshing. (they use Panpuri, wow). Worth the money. Will revisit for sure."
"Good staff and very cooperative. Room size is decent. Not very far from the main area. good the rate , this place is a must. Good lobby and amenities too. Would love to go back to this place next time too."
"the booking was made by my friend, and i was very pleased with this hotel. having traveled to Japan a number of times, the quality of the hotel is in line with Japan, and seems to cater to such a clientele. the onsen was not ready at the time i visited. rooms are decent size, brand new, and spotlessly clean. good value for money, should include a breakfast in my view! great location to get around from, and in the area there is plenty of food, bars, and legitimate massage options"
This is to compliment staff Mr.Man for the hospitality and good service during my stay at SO Sofitel Bangkok. Love the hotel design and concept. The pool is very amazing. The food at Red Oven in breakfast time is served with lot of choices. Really happy at SO Sofitel Bangkok
Love staying here as its closed to all night life!! Thong Lo is cool  I was there with my girl and we have fun there a lot  the hotel has very nice and friendly staff  I recommend for those who enjoy spending time hanging out!
"I like the restaurant and breakfast! but yeah also the staff are friendly and very helpful and the location is great,very easy to travel and nice night life  I recommend for those who wanna stay in city lights !!"
"The hotel is next to Thong lo station. Only 2 minutes by walk, so no need to fight traffic, cross the road. The staff was very friendly and helpful for further information. Also, I very enjoy breakfast."
"Stayed in this hotel, I have stayed at Hotel Verve Bangkok for 3 times this year and the great experience has always been the same which is the very reason that I will go back again professional staff the minute you walk in their front doors. All are very helpful even with my little requests and hospitable. I am always looked after with great courtesy and attention. All hotel staff I encountered were friendly, helpful, well presented and efficient. Their breakfast buffet is preferable and tasty. My room was comfortable and I am always assured that it would be clean when I would come back from a very busy day, oh and very reasonably priced. I felt safe walking around the area day or night and very conveniently available to the Malls and other nearby Thonglor. Many Japanese"
The Location is convenient for the person who would like to stay and enjoy the night life around Thonglor area. The decorations was new with Japanese style and the price is reasonable.Hotel staff are helpful
"Stayed for 4 nights with my friends. The check in was easy and the staff efficient and friendly. 3 spacious lifts make getting up and down with cases etc easy.   This is a very new and clean hotel in a great location, 3 minute walk from BTS station. Perfect location for transport and sightseeing. There are lots of shops and restaurants around the hotel.   The room is very nice and comfortable with all the amenities you need.  Recommend this hotel!"
"It's located in a heart of night life area,  loving it.   The place is clean and quiet spacious.  Modern design and well decorated.  Staff are helpful and so friendly as the information about the area are well provided.  I'll be back here"
"We had a wonderful stay here in Bangkok. Hotel Verve is an excellent hotel, perfectly situated close to BTS, making most attractions only a short walk away.  Staff at this hotel were highly professional and extremely helpful with directions, recommendations, suggestions etc. All of the front desk staff were pleasant and accommodating from check in to checkout.  The breakfast was great!  The rooms and the bathroom was nice . Modern, clean and very comfortable.  I recommend!"
"Very nice and comfortable hotel, I travelled with my family and found that it's very nice to reach the attractions I would like to recommend the restaurant as well.  The staffs are friendly and helpful. I'll be back here again for onsen!!"
"Just few minutes walking from the BTS skytrain, guess it's very comfortable for people who need easy access to public transportation!  Nice and spacious room :)  waiting for Onsen though, i will surely be back here again"
"I am very surprised with the amenities here, love them...all from Panpuri. I checked in with my husand and yeah i like the location where i can reach many attractions in Bangkok. For sure i will be back here, the place is recommened!"
"I stayed at this hotel many years ago when it was the grand tower inn.A recent return visit I found the place had been completely re furbished to a very high standard.Everything is new.The rooms are spacious,the location good..staff friendly and helpful.An enjoyable stay."
"Rooms (Grand Deluxe room type): Extremely new hardware, everything is in good condition. More than sufficient space for 2 adults. Toiletary fittings are Toto brand, and toiletries are a good local brand (cannot remember which one exactly). That being said, the toilet bowl did get clogged during our stay (flush was quite weak before and after the clog, not as strong as I am used to), which maintanence team fixed quickly.  Breakfast: We opted for the room package with breakfast inclusive. The breakfast is buffet style, with a relatively average spread. Enough to fill the stomach, but nothing to write home about.  Location: Short walk from Thonglor BTS, directly beside Hotel Nikko (which might be a better landmark for Grab or taxi pickup / drop off location). Taxi driver from"
"i found an offer in thonglor area which is where i planned to go for my bangkok trip because i want to be near all the highlights of bangkok.   found out hotel is very new!!    thai staff are super friendly and always helped me.  i could walk everywhere.   very good.  good price, too."
"Very new and modern style hotel in Thonglo area with great services from hotel staffs. This hotel is close with the department store, street foods,  nightlife and skytrain. Just walk from Thonglo train station only 5 mins. We will be back for sure. üòä"
"I believe this hotel was once of another brand.  Now it has been renovated and re-branded to Hotel Verve.  I got a special opening rate, quite good.  The hotel looks brand new, and very modern looking.   Still very soft opening, but staffs were very nice and friendly.  will come again the next time I'm here."
"I stayed at Hotel Verve for two nights and found it most pleasant. The hotel overall was very nice, clean and modern. The room was spacious enough and comfortably furnished. The bath tub was huge which made the feeling of nice holiday so much stronger. Close to high end restaurants, bars and shopping if that's what one is looking for, but also close to metro to go someplace else as Sukhumvit is maybe not the most interesting area when looking for cultural or historical experiences. Service was great! Only downside was the breakfast which was rather dull with few options and not reaching my expectations of a more high end hotel."
