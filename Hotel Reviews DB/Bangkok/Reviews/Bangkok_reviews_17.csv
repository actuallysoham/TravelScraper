"common, i wro9te you already. And about my member ship, first still waiting for points to get and was not really special take care. Staff dont speak enough good englisch. need more improvment in Serice, BREAKFAST,"
"I was in the area for a couple of days work and I brought my family to stay at this hotel since it is close to the office I visited. Great service and friendliness from the staff! Cosy pool area, wonderful for the whole family. The hotel is adjacent to Central Lad Prao shopping mall. The Centrals are usually very good but this one is probably my favourite thanks to the fantastic food level/court on the bottom floor. The Food Hall is also among the better I have seen. Will stay here again for sure when I need to be in the area. The hotel restaurants are also very good. The Italian on the reception floor was high class. More on that one in a separate review."
"I changed the environment ""work from home"" to be ""work from hotel"" during Covid-19 pandemic. Located next to Jatujark (weekend) market and Central Shopping Plaza, Ladprao. Easy public transportation access. Friendly, English speaking staff with warm welcoming smiles."
The perfect place for those who like a traditional hotel. Good facilities and great staff. They really make you feel at home. The gym is better than most you find at a hotel. The pool area is a great place to relax and let the world pass by.
"I'm in bangkok for work, you want a comfortable hotel, this is it;  in fact it is on the road to saraburi, I save myself a bar two hours of Bangkok traffic in the morning and the same in the evening.  Then the hotel is nice clean, good restaurants"
"I have stayed several times in this hotel which I consider relatively cheap, considering comfort, service, practicality and courtesy.  The services in the hotel like various types of restaurants, the Spa, the conference areas, characterize the efficiency and availability for both tourist stays and, as in my case, for work.  Well furnished rooms, spacious and well equipped bathroom, are an important added value.  And still are the Wifi in the room."
"The staff here are very nice and kind.  Even though I stayed only one night here, I was happy with the service here. Breakfast was great, tasted much better than Centara Grande Mirage Pattaya (sorry to say this, but last time I visited Pattaya, the food tasted so-so, not good compared to the price.)  The bathtub was big, and I love how the hotel prepared bath foam. My baby was really happy with it. I wish I would visit here again. Thank you for your excellent service."
Easy to go shopping.  There is no kid's club. No USB charging port in the room. Share car park with the department store which took more time to find an available lot. Food was great. Kids got free ice cream promotion. They should have option for welcome ice-cream instead of welcome drink ;).
The hotel is good located. It's near Central Plaza Ladprao Department Store. But should improve the internet signal and quality and variety of breakfast Have used the Italian restaurant in an acceptable level
"It was stunning view from the Blue Sky bar where I can see the incredible Bangkok view. I’ve been there with my bf for celebrating our anniversary. The staffs who taking care us since welcoming, escorting untill billIng process was nice. They are Khun Kheng, Khun Ray and Khun Jaew. Moreover, we got a special amenity which are 2 glasses of Blue Sky mocktails decelerated by the beautiful plate. We were surprised with it and really love it. However, food is nice as well even we ordered only one menu. Finally, I do recommend this restaurant for dinner. It’s romantic and wonderful! I’ll be back for sure. Thank you Cream"
"I used to stay here once long time ago and the service was good but not like this time. This experience was unexpected. I know hotel try to save cost and use this time for renovation. No inform before check-in or make the booking. From 10am-4pm, banging noise are everywhere; lobby, or in the room.  Service .. no standard on hygiene. Our room was open before check in normal. Other room will have the certificate showing about the room is clean what quality check with a sticker on the door. So no sticker on our room. It was ok as covid in Thailand is not that bad. I was ask for baby cot, housekeeper bring it and did not were a mask, but when we went for breakfast without mask. We were ask to wear mask, ... standard?, we were told that mask was provided in the room. “Nothing is"
"Great service, clean room, excellent location, great value for money. Facilities are good as well. Feels comfortable to stay in here .Would definitely recommend to friends and family about this hotel, needless to say, i would also come back here to stay for my next bangkok trip!"
"Good location, easy to access with BTS or MRT(walking distance). Good for people who came from Donmuang Airport. Connected to Central Ladprao, made this hotel super handy. But the room  will be much better if have a proper renovate"
"Services in covid-19 crisis perfect even the hotel have very few customers and closed 1 day after my departure. Specially the executive lounge service are same always. A kind of feat in these exceptional circumstances. Mention to the very pro Natthida.  Thanks for everything to all the staff,  and see you in better time!"
We booked a room for 2 adults and 2 children. On arrival we found a room with only 2 beds. They even suggested one of the children to sleep on the couch. After some discussion we were upgraded to a bigger room in which they put 2 additional beds.
"I am lucky enough to spend 45 days every winter in Thailand.  However the high spot for me are the final three nights I spend in The Centara Grand Central Plaza, before flying home.  Its location, just 25 minutes from the international airport by one of the hotel's limo's, is just perfect for a relaxed trip to catch my flight is perfect  As the hotel is within the superbly upscale Central Plaza shopping mall, I am easily able to satisfy my retail therapy requirements.  I am able to relax and top up my tan around the huge open air pool, which is set in three acres of stunningly beautiful gardens.  I have a great gym to exercise in, and a beautiful spa to pamper myself in.  In the evenings, I have the choice ofseven great restaurants to dine in.  As I always take a club room, I"
The lobby lounge staff Khun O and khun Arkom are so amazing. They recommended some fantastic places where not many people go. We had wonderful cocktails and the attention they gave to every customer was a warm welcome. I read some of the reviews to this hotel but found only very old comments on the lobby bar. I give the staff 100%. I asked to talk to bar manager and she was called but never showed up. Stayed her for 6 days only seen her 1 time at the entrance of the lobby bar but did not aproache her as she was not looking happy. In my experience in staying at hotels its lovely to see a manager come talk to guests. Deffinutly miss the man that was here before. He took pride in the lobby bar. Hope this new manager can read this and think about the guests that visit lobby lounge.
"I stay here for three nights every February, and every year it gets better.  It has so much going for it...     The location, midway between the two international airports, just 30 minutes from either via the hotel's excellent limousine service, and within 20 minutes of Bangkok's busy downtown, plus being situated within the first class Central Plaza mall.  Its beautiful and extensive gardens and swimming pool.  Its world-class gym and luxurious spa.  Its choice of seven fine restaurants.  Its staff, from the wonderful head doorman, who unfailingly remembers me every year upon my arrival, through reception, chambermaids, and waiting staff, all are welcoming, warm, and unfailingly helpful.  I always take a Club Room, which I recommend to achieve the full Centara Grand experience."
Awesome room design for the corner room! Very convenient to go to the mall because it is connected directly to the mall thru the parking building. Fast internet with LAN cable for laptop uninterrupted connection.
"Khun Jaew - The waitress so nice with guest interaction and engagement. She pay attention to all details and know what we want, anyway the atmosphere may possibly to improve with Fan and less of mosquito"
"Enjoy to stay here, like home away from home, staffs was so friendly food almost every outlets was good taste, really enjoy.during we stay here...we really enjoy almost facilities and service all complementary at the club lounge , we feel good."
I attended seminar being held at centara by the Asia Pacific seed Association. I found hotel facilities was excellent. Your privacy is always your privacy. My stay was much more comfortable as I was worried about my stay.
a rather comfortable place and nice ambience..it has some good restaurants and has a direct and connection to a mall.. a nice gym and scenic pool.. not far from the airport.. staff are nice as well.. however quite far from main town of bangkok..
"This hotel was wonderful and very clean.  The breakfast in Chatuchak Cafe is absolutely phenomenal - there are at least 100 options of different foods and juices.    Additionally, TRUST ME and get a Traditional Thai massage while you are there.  It was the best massage I've ever gotten and the price was great.  I got it on our last night and tried to schedule another one for the morning before I left, but they were booked up.  Honestly, I am tempted to go back to Thailand just for a massage at this hotel.    The restaurant Suan Bua at the hotel was really subpar.  We were the first people there when it opened, and it still took us over 2 hours to eat and get our check.  We asked for our check and a dessert to go simultaneously, and it took 30 minutes (we timed it) to get both."
"Central Shopping Mall is linked to Hotel. Easily access, thus foods and shopping essentials are easily obtained.  Rooms are reasonable size, bath room is spacious. Bed is comfortable and thus gave good night sleep."
"Very lousy at the check in and check out side.  The process was slow and got a lot of issues:  -Card access to room got issue on the last day  -Name was printed wrongly despite the feedback via email, including going down to the reception to change it."
"I spent a night on this hotel and the service was excellent.  I used room 1920, at Club level and the facilities matches the expected quality as advertised. The staff was pleasant and always kind. Congratulations"
"This hotel, although not central is close to the sky train. I was apprehensive at first but there was no need to be. Just walk through the mall to the station.  The staff and food were top quality. We had breakfast every morning-spoilt for choice. Also we had a buffet dinner in the Chatuchak restaurant. Fantastic."
"Stayed here this week and am happy to experience the same high level quality as I did during my previous stay here a few years ago. My room was spacious, clean, quiet, had everything I required, bed very comfortable.  Breakfast buffet has a lot of choices and a great way to start the day.  Always glad to stay here when I am in this part of the city."
"Hsiao-Min was totally unpleasant. The way she handled the situation was horrible. When Kotchaporn was handling my query, Hsiao-Min just took over abruptly as if she is welcome. I had 2 separate bookings and requested to maintain in the same room. I understand it is subjected to availability but the way Hsiao-Min rejected me without even checking. This frustrates me. She even squinted at Kotchaporn with an irritated and agitated look. Is this the kind of service you put at the front desk to represent your Hotel? More importantly, is this the kind of hospitality Thailand offers? The land of smiles? On the other hand, Naruth, Kotchaporn and the morning Trainee was very friendly and professional.  The pillow quality is inconsistent. When I was in level 17, the pillows were very"
Great breakfast where the items changed even on a daily basis. Good location next to large shopping mall (Centra Plaza) where there is plentiful shopping and food options. Walking distance to Tesco and another mall Union Mall.
"This is my 2nd time to stay here (4 nights).  Comfortable stay and convenient location.  Can walk to the mall next door and also to the MRT station, only 1 stop to Chatuchak weekend market.   Lots of restaurants nearby if you don't want to spend that much in the hotel.   I won't consider this a 5* hotel, 4* only.  Buffet breakfast was good and sufficient.  Lots of choices, but mostly asian varieties, not much western choices like smoked salmon.    If I visit Thailand again, I would stay because of location."
Excellent location with connectivity to BTS for easy access. The room is clean & in excellent conditions. Hotel staffs are friendly & always offer a helping hands. WiFi speed is also excellent during the stay.
"Room was nice and staff are friendly, Area close to shopping mall and BTS ladprao which easy to walk from hotel. BTS ladprao already opened so can  take airport train to this hotel and walk through shopping mall to hotel."
"It is 700 meters from Ha Yaek Lat Phrao BTS station and 600 meters from Phahon Yothin MRT station respectively. You can walk from the hotel to Central Plaza (5 min), Chutuchak Weekend Market and J.J. Mall (35 min). The hotel offers shuttle buses to the latter two though I have not used them.  But I had a bad experience asking the hotel staff to get me a taxi. I showed the staff my destination clearly on a google map. But the taxi driver tried to take me to a different place farther away. I don't know whether it was caused by poor communication or dishonesty. I will stick to BTS, MRT or buses in the future to avoid problems with taxi drivers."
"I went to this hotel because it was located near Suan Mookh park and I went to a remembrance there. I was pleasantly surprised, the room was spacious and the shower was strong, good wifi and it is right next to the central lad Phrao shopping mall. I went to tops to buy some snacks and I was amazed at the variety of shops selling all kinds of goodies. I was frightened that if I stayed more than a day I would burst from all of the great food there. There tops supermarket was the largest one I have ever been in and the variety choices were massive, I will stop here again. Staff was very professional and helpful."
"Easy to access from/to subway and sky train. As we had booked a twin bed room and the room was not available by the time we arrived early, the front desk let us get the room on a club floor as it is available. Wow!! The breakfast is great with everything, Aidan and western foods, fresh juice and fruits. The staff is professional and attentive. Perfect stay with good experience."
"It would be a great the hotel if their electronic devices up to date and their room is fully functional.. However, their staffs are very helpful and accommodating to their guests. Therefore I rated their services better than their facilities."
Location is amazing as it's attached to central mall. Staff are really good and they all know very well what they are doing.  Just the location wouldn't give you best of the Thailand feeling as it's a bit too modern to feel the tradition.  Overall a great hotel.
"Overall good. Staff are very friendly and helpful. When turn on the tap for hot water, it takes long time (5 minutes) to get hot water. Hygiene can be further improved. The foods at the restaurant are excellent."
Khun Smile welcomed us very warmly to the roof top Blue sky bar. We enjoyed some delicious cocktails served by Khun Meaw and Khun Keng took some great photos of us with the city as a moving background. The ambience was super and an additional surprise was the Birthday cake. It was our daughters 21st birthday.  A memorable evening with special people. Thank you Blue Sky Bar.
"Overall trip experience was pretty good, Always i am expecting some south indian / Indian food for breakfast, since 2 years i am visiting Bangkok & staying only @ Centara grand hotel. Expecting some Indian breakfast to be included."
The hotel is just amazing very close to the metro station.  Facilities are great. Went on last week of dec with my family for new year's in Bangkok.  Are at chatukchak cafe. Chef Mr Arun Nag did his best to accommodate our request for Indian vegetarian foodand prepared really good food.  I would have given 5 stars bitt I was disappointed as the number of staffs were very few in chatukchak cafe and they were not able to provide the expected service experience.  Overall I would recommend the property.
"The pool is very small for such a big hotel. Rooms are neat and clean. Its an extremely busy hotel, check in and check out takes a lot of time. Very strange but check in time is at 3:00 PM, and we got our room at 4:00 PM. But its a huge and wonderful property, good dinning options and very good breakfast well."
"They managed to keep it grand even though we can see the building been running for a long time. Good service. Good breakfast. Walk distance to the mall which can lead to BTS station. There’s a green/garden/outdoor area with pool, perfect for unwind in the middle of hustle bustle Bangkok. Got a rooftop bar if you want to chill out at night before bed. They got us complimentary birthday cake for my husband when I requested... overall is a good experience staying with Centara."
"One of the best located hotels in bangkok. It's at the heart of the city, with 3 shopping malls adjoining the hotel. Options of good indian food available inside as well as outside hotel. The staff is very courteous and helpful. Special mention of aditya (one of the hotel manager) who took care of us like family."
Attentive staff and good rooms. Club lounge was a bit small but intimate. Choose the rooms facing away from the school. Noisy traffic controls at times Buffet dinner is good value considering the range of seafood and deserts.
"Very clean and safe, comfortable rooms. Excellent staff and very efficient and friendly. English was well spoken. The rooms were well appointed and spacious and the bed/bedding was very comfortable. I would highly recommend."
"If you come to ladprao area, for any reasons, to find 5stars hotel may not easily unless going to city center but at central plaza shopping mall , you will see a tall building where both BTS & MRT train stations meet, Centara Grand hotel, old but keep it well hotel, I was there to have meeting with partners, at Libby lounge whereby you could find comfortable sitting area for casual meeting and enjoy nice coffee   Buffet dinner with varieties choices of international culinary, also Japanese cuisine for your sushi or traditional cooking dishesp  Try it if you not have anywhere in your mind.."
Cenrara Lardpraw gave me the highest comfort and convenience. I thought the hotel was too far from the city center but it was not at all because of the BTS public transpirtation. The hotel has the direct access to the station and the large shopping center. I enjoyed the stay.
Stayed here with my wife as part of a four centre trip to Thailand. Primary reason for visit was a friend’s traditional Thai wedding in Bangkok and chose this hotel for its proximity to the wedding venue.   Can not fault the hotel facilities or the staff who were always friendly and helpful. Not necessarily convenient for the major tourist attractions and worth bearing in mind that for large parts of the day the traffic will double the time for most taxi journeys. Use the Grab app and book a car rather than a taxi as it is fixed price.   Breakfast is amazing. Also ate at the international buffet one evening with the choice being superb and catering for all tastes.   Hotel is attached to the huge central plaza shopping centre with lots of food choices.   For me another plus was
Hotel is near the BTS station and really convenience to anywhere along BTS stations. Walk across the car park could go to Central Department Store as well as shopping mail & supermarket. Eating and shopping are very convenience.
"I stayed in this Hotel north of Bangkok visiting our factories. This hotel was located near shopping centers and transportation. Hotel has most of the normal areas we would want and a well serviced SPA there. Staff was very helpful to me. Don Giovanni dining was excellent. The food there was good. I tend not to order Duck, because it is hard to find people that cook it well. Here it was done well. One waitress there was so wonderful to me to, I wish I asked her, her name!"
Very nice and quiet area comparing the city hotels .  Atrached to the mall.  Big room .clean and very well equiped.  We have a bath and shower .  The room service is amazing not expensive at all .  The top roof a big huge bar from where u can see bangkok  clearly .  Must try .
"This was truly the perfect hotel for both business and vacationing.  The staff at the front desk, concierge, and the Club Executive Lounge were very professional and friendly.  We spent a part of a day at the beautiful pool and my husband enjoyed a 2 hour spa treatment.  The food was fantastic at the breakfast buffet with so many dishes to choose from.  The hotel is next to one of the beautiful Bangkok Shopping Malls, Central Mall, with top designer shops.  The hotel also has a shuttle to various places near this area including the weekend market."
"We spent 3 night in this beautiful hotel with excellent service. We got free pick up and drop off. A room was quite large, clean and comfortable. Staff helped with free upgrade for better room. They are very professional. Next time we coming back to you."
"Rooms are very good, staff is super friendly, location next to the mall is very convenient, the rooftop bar is great for a drink, but what makes this hotel exceptional is the breakfast.  Many choices from Thai, Chinese to Western, fresh juices, fruits and a huge sweat corner paired with very friendly staff makes a stay here amazing."
"As a hotel, this place offers pretty standard rooms and surrounds.  The staff impressed me with their efforts to be friendly and helpful.  My taxi driver from the airport took me to the wrong Centara Grand as did my tuk tuk driver so make sure you get the address right!"
"I stayed at the hotel for business at the recommendation of my business partner. The hotel has a wonderful staff, clean and well appointed rooms and several excellent restaurants. The location is near to Don Mueang airport and you can walk to the shopping mall"
"Stayed in a club level suite on our last night in Bangkok.  The club lounge provided us with breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. We were given a free up grade,  the room was lovely, which included a free standing bath, shower, and chaise lounge. This hotel has direct access to a shopping mall and is near the BTS station. We went to the breakfast buffet which is open to all guests, and I  can honestly say i have never seen such a choice from cereals to spare ribs, curries etc etc  !"
Comfortable and cozy experience at the centara. I recommend to join for a stay short or long. Also the facilities are very good and the food is amazing alla the time. If you had the chance it is worth it.
"Hotel was just great, beyond expectations! Nothing came to my attention that could have impacted my experience there. Highly recommend both for vacation and business needs stay! Breakfast was simply amazing!"
"Check in was very efficient and quick. Had to pay a 6000 THB (£155.00) deposit for a 3 night stay here, would be better for guests if this was made clear on the hotel booking confirmation, it wasnt mentioned on ours. The room was of a high standard. The staff were very friendly and attentive. Breakfast was very good, with plenty of choice. My only complaint with this hotel is the lifts, the lifts worked fine, BUT every time one of the lifts was called / arrived it let off a loud ""bing bong"" noise to announce its arrival. Not a problem during the day but all through the night intensely annoying. Bearing in mind that this hotel is used as an airport hotel, including cabin crew staying here, there are guests coming and going through the day and night. Management really need to go"
"Beautiful hotel, my favourite part was the beautiful cozy bath tub. The room is spacious and staff are friendly. The hotel is a bit far from city center which was an issue as it takes ages by taxi to reach anywhere. The good part it's located next to a shopping center and metro station."
"It is nice stay in Centara Grand at Central Plaza Ladprao Bangkok, Hotel is nice and comfortable. Came for several times and like it very much especially with opening of BTS connect to Central Plaza, make this hotel a good place for stay / shopping / eating and transportation."
"Services everywhere were excellent. Room was made perfect. Pillows and linens were comfortable. Courtesy water bottles were mostly enough, but could be three bottles a day. Had some internet issues. Breakfast and food at the restaurant were of remarkable variety and taste."
"First class hotel in every way, highly recommend it..  Staff very friendly, rooms good size and very well equipped, food excellent. I would have no hesitation in staying in this hotel should I be in Bangkok  again."
"I reservation room & lunch & cake about 1 week but when I have lunch and take a cake employee tell me. Sale not reservation lunch & order cake with restaurant cannot take it. I call sale K.Prapaporn, She tell me for check and call me back but no call . after I call  her again but no answer.very bad for this Before I reservation room @krabi. Sale use 1 week to answer me & tell me can not stay in this place (So long time) I feeling bad"
The ambiance was exquisite. services are on the dot and accommodation is very welcoming. the one thing i only dislike is the position of the pool wherein it is outside the premises of the building not in the building itself. it was late to know that pool area is on the ground floor.
"The hotel is very clean, this includes the room. The breakfast buffet was very good with variety of food. The hotel staff were friendly.  What I like best about the hotel is the free Wi-Fi service which is very good, the comfortable bed and the breakfast buffet."
Connected to Central Plaza and so many restaurants in the mall.  We also had access to executive level 24. We are going back for two more nights!  I signed up for a member and booked directly on hotel website and very happy with our stayed last week.
"Hotel needs refurbishment. Service (check in and out, and restaurant/breakfast) is slow. need to be more efficient. However breakfast menu was good (only missing basic thing, like steam plain white rice) Restaurant staff needs to learn more English to communicate with guest."
"How do I begin? This spot has been recommended to me by many people, so my expectations were high. Right off the bat, the staff here are excellent, from the front of house, to cleaners, customer service is number 1. The room though was disappointing, although it is nice, it's standards of a nice room has aged. Perhaps it is my expectations, but the condo I stayed at before here felt nicer."
"Since we are working in Aviation, Centara Grand at Central Plaza Ladprao is the best choice to stay. Near to ICAO office. Halal food available made it even meaningful.  Used the gym for a quick sweat out. Didn’t get to use the sauna. Overall, a good stay. Keep it up."
Excellent hotel. Very kind and helpful staff. Restaurant Don Giovanni good but slightly expensive. Good cleanliness and comfortable rooms. The Club is really very comfortable. I'll be back in 2020 for another business trip.
I do recommend this hotel for everyone... Obe of the best hotels all over the world  Thank you centata for the good service and customer service you have and the amazing team in all the hotel ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Hi,i was staying in this hotel as because we are part of observers  to support our national team in AseanSkills.  i would like to recommend this hotel for those who loves to shopping because this hotel is attached with a mall. The room is also spaciuos, great service given by the staff in front of the house. After done check in, u will have your welcome drink to be redeemed at the bar. For muslims traveler, do not to worry they have a complimentary fruits juice for u. But for the food, as it complimentary with breakfast, i would just ate cereals and fruits only. and of course with juice and coffee. Thats all. But i love to spent  in Centara Grand Hotel."
A nice hotel to stay at in Bangkok. Shopping centerand BTS station just nearby. Good for person want to fly off from BMK airport. Not too far from Bangkok CBD. Will recommend this hotel to friends who like to come to Bangkok for holiday.
"This is an ideal city hotel where everything you need is very close by which is ideal in a busy city like Bangkok - huge shopping centre attached to the hotel for international brands and local food / bars both inside and close by outside.  There is nothing missing in the hotel for a luxurious stay - nice rooms, gym, pool, and many restaurants, we especially enjoyed the club lounge where the staff were the most friendly and professional we have ever met anywhere in Asia. We will be back."
"Good and clean and spacious rooms. The facilities as Swimmingpool and Spa is fantastic. I would stay Here again. There is an easy Access to a very big Shopping mall with Great Restaurants and a bin supermarket. The Location is a Bit Outside of the central area, but BTS nearby."
Take Sky Train to Chit Lom Station. Diagonally opposite on a short walk is the Central Shopping Mall. Seven floors of shops and a foodhall on the top floor. A modern shopping mall within contemporary building. High end brands and quality products.The foodhall on thd 7th floor has many choices of international as well as local Thai food. Very helpful and courteous staffs.
Highly recommended. Lactation is perfect convenient for transportation. 15 minutes from Donmueng airport by taxi or airport bus. 5 minutes to BTS “ yekladprao” station.  Room were very clean and comfortable. Good view from the room. Staffs were very friendly and caring.
"The staff at Centara Grand were so friendly and helpful, it really was the highlight of staying here. Of particular note was the extra effort made by the front door staff to hail a taxi for me early in the early morning of my departure - that is they actually went out of the hotel grounds and down to the main road to flag a driver down.  I do agree with other contributors that the actual hotel is a bit dated and could do with a renovation but this is completely out of the control of the staff and I would certainly return here in the future."
"The hotel reservation service is very bad. If you send mail to book the hotel, you need to send same mail over 5 times. For the pick up limousine service, you need to send mail 10 times, and you can get the confirmation letter. The hotel is one of the worst experience for me."
Great stay. Amazing staff and the breakfast had a really big selection.   Stayed for a tournament in the shopping mall just outside. So location for me was perfect. My wife whent shopping and just used the skytrain that has a stop connected to hotel and the mall so everyone was happy.  Will stay here again.
A very convenient hotel with BTS connection and mall connected to it. Good breakfast and is halal friendly. The room is nice and clean and they use panpuri as their shower gel lotion shampoo and etc. Really nice smelling and leave a good feeling after it.
"thank you very much to all staff, this was great. My last visit, in the then called Sofitel, was 20 years ago and it was a great return for me - very, very good, indeed! The Quality provided is the same or even better than 20 years ago and the profesionalism and friendlyness is outstanding."
"The room is clean, comfortable and quite spacious. The staffs are very friendly. Especially Ms Nongnuch at the Executive Lounge is very attentive and amicable. We felt relaxed and well taken care of at the Executive Lounge after a day of hard work."
Stayed at the Centara Grand while on a business trip to Bangkok.  Experienced true Thai Hospitality at the hotel with friendly and courteous staff. The hotel is linked to the BTS and Subway Station through a shopping center and the location is great. Almost anything you need is a stones throw away including the famous chatuchak weekend market. I will certainly consider this hotel on my next trip to Bangkok.
"We arrived at 23.00 PM but I need to waiting the room about 40 mins. It's long time for me. They should be prepared the room for urgent guest and need to know how to reduce the time to waiting the room at your hotel's. In the room very cleanness and the bed very comfortable, breakfast have a variety food."
Great location with its own shopping and entertainment. Guests who bring their own cars will have a hard time with parking. Hotel has only one bridge connecting to parking garage and hotel doesn’t block out a parking area for them
"A very nice place to stay at the heart of the city. The cozy inside matches the busy of the outside. Great service, reasonable prices, and a lot of activities for both young and elderly. I'd recommend this hotel for short or long stays. Well done!"
"Overall good stay. Convenient to access public transport, food and mall. There is nearby BTS and MRT station. Friendly staffs everywhere. Variety of breakfast buffet is available. Just being frightened by the television sometimes as it goes blackout on and off in my room, guess was connectivity issue"
"Can be better. And years when stay in Centara, the experience was great and memorable.  Today, I have experienced one of sour face receitionpsit ,and lie to me she did not charge my cards for deposit when she had already done so. ."
"I stayed here for 5 nights and it is a nice place to stay overall. The wifi is real bad though. It is linked to a big shopping mall via car park. After the mall closing hours, you have to walk a big round to back to hotel. There are not many massage available around. The price for massage spa in hotel is expensive compared to market price."
I like clean room and comfortable room when I stay hear. This hotel locate in central Bangkok with close to express way and sky train. It’s convenient to go to the other place when I travel. It’s also close to big department store for easily to shopping and select good food.
We stayed here for a week and never ran out of things to do. A shopping mall is attached to the parking deck and the room staff were accommodating to special requests. There is a small safe in the room but my favorite part was the walk in shower with a rainfall effect.
"I booked the room for my seminar  and also I need to rest here , I have a great  experience from the staff since the front desk area ,my seminar setting up at 3 am. anytime that I need special help ,these guys always shown up to support me even delivered my stuffs, equipments right through my car .

"This is our 2nd visit in 2 years . Everything to our expectations besides one comment I have to make , unfortunately on the day we had breakfast there was no live soup station which I was disappointed in my favorite country Thailand., however everything else was up to the high standard of centara."
