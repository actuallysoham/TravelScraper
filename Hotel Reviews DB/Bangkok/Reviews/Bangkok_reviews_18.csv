"Novotel Siam Square although quite dated, the hotel was recently renovated so the in-room facilities are sufficient in some aspects but still overall a bit dated. The location is the best thing about the hotel since it‚Äôs located in the middle of siam square. The staff are also friendly and helpful. I would recommend for business travels that require prime location."
"The location is fantastic located at the on of the most busiest area in the heart of Bangkok, closes to Sian square, Siam Paragon and Chulalongkorn university. My check in as fast and very convenient. The room is a bit small as a normal city hotel."
The room is nice and clean. Staffs are helpful. Food is delicious.   Location is good in the middle of town near many shopping centers. A lot of good restaurants. The swimming is a little small and need cleaning. Apart from that everything‚Äôs good.
"Hello Friend. I paid for DELUXE ROOM 2 SINGLE BEDS.   Reservation number: KFDSBFQR   Transaction number: KFDSBFQR_0300000082115051PP. Date of stay: From Mar. 07, 2021 to Mar. 09, 2021. I got SUPERIOR ROOM 2 SINGLE BEDS. No. 831. This number is cheaper than what I paid for. Why was I placed in a different room without compensation? Thanks you"
"Located at the foot of the BTS, perfect location for getting around Bangkok. Deco and old-fashioned materials. Very pleasant staff and service. Take care, if you have to park in the car park, be careful because pipes in the ceiling can ruffle the roof of your car. It happened to me and I would have appreciated a commercial gesture that never happened..."
"very good service and friendly stuff. Suprise took care of us and sownd a lot of time giving us a great service. The breakfast is good, mainly Asian food (well you‚Äòre in Asia). The location is perfect. A small market is next to the hotel. One 7/11 is across the street and another around the corner. Two shopping malls and a Skytrain Station are 2min away. I don‚Äòt have any negative points to mention. And for the price it‚Äòs a steal!"
"thanks for early check in, free room upgrade and good services.  no have guest scotter parking area, so i parking outside at staff's area. room was a bit old and shower room's invisible window was not well function.  overall was nice. thank you."
We went here for an early Christmas dinner and it was amazing. We will certainly try to return next year. The staff and food were wonderful. It was also a convenient location- only a few yards from the BTS.
"Love Novotel Siam! The ladies at the reception are the most welcoming hosts. Pump, Jah and Khun Tar ofc! ;) We always stay here and never disappoints. The buffet at their recently renovated restaurant is amazing. Highly recommended! See you guys again, soon! Khun Ben & family"
For shopping trip great location. Very easy for the mall and skytrain. Hotel came into age. Room more a tourist hotel. Junior Suite should have a coffee machine. Bed were very comfortable. Furniture furnishing cluld be a little more up to date
"First impressions were not the best as trying to unload a packed car along with having a sleeping child in the car. Pulled up to the front and was told by security that could not drive up to front unloading area as an artist was about to leave for concert nearby and that I should wait patiently in the front of the hotel...10 minutes go by and no word. I start to see my parking is causing congestion, so I decide to go park in the parking garage instead, as no big deal, understand a concert is occurring. Fast forward to when I am checking out and my son is having his after non nap. He obviously likes to sleep a lot :) So call down to the front desk and ask them if we can postpone 1 hour on checkout and tell them the little one is sleeping. Put on hold and told, apologies there are"
"We had to fly down to BKK for dental appointments and stayed at this hotel  Being an Accor Silver member and needing nights.  Check In and Check Out was quick and efficient.  Though I did do the online check in.  As most people know tourism is dead due ... Well I shall leave it at that.   We were upgraded to room 1701 on both stays.  Room was nice.  Had lounge chair, Comfortable bed. Very hot water. Plenty of towels and amenities.  BUT were it missed the mark is in two specific items. And if anyone from the hotel is reading this THEY DO NEEDED ATTENDED TOO.  Safe?  Does not work.  Dead as a door nail Shower head?  Way past its sale date. Water goes in every direction but down. A pure pain to take a shower.  On the 2nd stay I decided to include breakfast.  The Square restaurant,"
"The hotel is located very near Chulalongkorn University, so it is the best option for a nice stay during the commencement ceremony. The staff were polite and supportive. Although this was the first time I spent at Novotel Siam Square, I got an upgraded room from superior room to executive premier room. This made our stay so memorable. The executive premier room was on the premier floor and had a very nice city view. The room was very clean and convenient. The hotel housekeeping staff were also friendly."
Had excellent service from staff at Gourmet bar and with a good band ( A Coustic Jam ) it made a good relaxing evening. The band had good range of music and will take requests.  So if you like a relaxing evening this is a good place to come
Our stay at Novotel Siam Square was very comfortable with exceptional attention from all staff. I particularly appreciated Guest Services Manager Khun Thapakorn Nukerk‚Äôs friendly and thorough attention to our stay upon checkin and throughout our visit. Best location in Bangkok and very quiet. We will be back!
"We originally booked for 6 nights; however, we like it so much that we have so far extended for an additional 4 nights.  The Novotel staff are extremely nice, and Soft (‡∏ô‡∏∏‡πà‡∏°) is the best of the best.  She is always so friendly and cheerful that I always make it a point to swing by Reception and say hi to her.  Gift (‡∏Å‡∏¥‡∏ü‡∏ó‡πå), Piichy (‡∏û‡∏µ‡∏ä‡∏µ‡πà) and Tah are are also friendly and cheerful with us as  well as others whom I don't know their names.  Michael, the Resident Manager, is doing an excellent job and it shows.    The location of the hotel is fantastic.  It is about a 2-3 minute walk to the Siam BTS and a 3 minute walk to my favorite shopping mall in Bangkok.....Siam Paragon.  This is the 3rd time I have stayed here and each time I have had an excellent stay.   I plan on staying"
"Staff said room with upgrade for new renovated but he forgot to tell me about ugly view that can see disgusting roof and disgusting food chimney!unfortunately, room is not new just simple and nothing nice."
Last night i had a wonderful dinner with my friend during heavy raining.   Very excellent for location. It's very easy to meet my friend even heavy raining because of closed BTSü§ó  Very good service and good take care from Ex Chef. I cant remember his name but he is a very good service and come to ask us about the food.  The staff is very sevice mind as well.  One nice place to meet up friends and recommend!
"During these months of being stuck in Thailand due to travel restrictions, i visited Bangkok several times. I needed a conveniently located hotel at walking distance from major shopping malls, also a place not too far by taxi from Embassies on the wireless road,. I chose the first time Novotel on Siam because of the location but then i went back several times for the quality of service the beautiful room and efficient Gym and an incredibly courteous, efficient staff crew. the only reservation about ti i might have is that during the months of COVID 19 rates have been very low. If I were to pay full price I might define it a bit overpriced overall"
"We stayed in this hotel because we are a loyal ACCOR Hotel member and because my typical teen daughter wanted a ""shopping"" birthday spree at Siam Square.    Since it was our FIRST TIME in this hotel, we initially booked for 1 night, because we really didn't know what to expect. But..... because the hotel rate was inexpensive, we stated our intentions to the FO Manager during check-in of staying for an additional 2 to 3, depending on my daughter's wishes. Apparently,  we only lasted ONE night. üòÖüòÇü§£  ON-CALL, BEFORE CHECK-IN: 3-STAR - I reserved for a room via phone call. That went smoothly and hassle-free!  - I asked if we could request a surprise birthday cake for my daughter. The receptionist said they couldn't give us one, even if we paid for it since they needed a 3-day"
The hotel staff is very helpful and friendly. The location is in the centre of Bangkok. Variety of food for breakfast but the taste could be a little bit improved. The hygiene is up to standard for COVID-19.
"On arrival I was upgraded to a new deluxe room (thank you). The hotel and room was super clean, all staff very friendly, breakfast was also very enjoyable. Used the pool and gym before my breakfast again very clean. Well done Novotel Bangkok, I will be back, thank you."
"Our stay here was disappointing. The hotel appears to be of a high standard based on pictures posted online, however some of the rooms are dark and dingy, and in need of refurbishment. Some floors are still smoking, which added to the dingy feel.   We hated our first room so much that we paid to upgrade to a refurbished room-  and even then I found the general state of these better rooms to be shoddy with broken fixtures, bad refurbishment and patch jobs. The workmanship didn't seem up to the usual Accor standard.  The hotel is located in the busy siam square area, surrounded by plush malls, so excellent for high end shopping and restaurants."
"This hotel has excellent location and premises. Rooms are big and clean, and staff is very professional and helpful. Hotel has good quality pool with all day sun shine and spa services.  Breakfast buffet with lot of choices."
Great location. Novotel Siam Square is always my most favorite hotel in Bangkok. Very convenient to connect through Bangkok‚Äôs destination. Easy for shopping also you can experience with all highlight restaurant especially White flowers restaurant; Thai local food. This is the best Thai food for me. So I can said this hotel is valuable price good location and great service
"I have stayed at this hotel for my annual trip to Bangkok for FIVE straight years, simply because it ticks every box for me. First: it is smack in Siam Square, which is bright and busy and safe; with ample restaurant and shopping options; and a hop and a skip from the Siam BTS Station -- with links to practically the entire city. Second: the staff are just lovely. ALL the staff, from concierge to restaurant to tour serviced to housekeeping -- every single one will bend over backwards to help you. I have turned up way before check-in time, departed way after check-out time, and if a room is not available they always provide somewhere to shower/freshen up; and the lobby sitting area is wonderfully comfortable, with isolated cosy spots that allow comfort and privacy. The rooms are"
"I arrived at Novotel Siam Sq on 13 Mar 2020 for a short getaway with my family of 3. We were served by Ms Gift who was polite and competent. Though the usual chk-in time is 2pm, she swiftly settled our check-in at 10am. We didn‚Äôt have to loiter around the hotel area and could freshen up before we went for early lunch.  Another special mention was the touch of empathy on their customers. We were supposed to leave on 18 Mar 2020 but due to the border restrictions imposed by my home country due to the covid-19 outbreak, we had to shorten our vacation and leave 2 days earlier than scheduled. The concierge helped us to contact the airlines and tried their best to resolve the matter. Though their attempts were unsuccessful, I appreciate their gd efforts.   Just before we left for the"
We were warmly greeted by their friendly staff by the name of Gift and she kindly upgraded our room. Check in was swift and location is right at the heart of Siam square area. What a nice surprise and thank you!
"The location is convenient, rooms are spacious and overall service was great, especially front desk staff Toktak and Milk.  They were very attentive and welcoming with their warm smiles. Would love to plan my next visit here again!"
"Beautiful establishment, loved the hotel . Very clean rooms. Service was exceptional. Location very nice and close to all shops and restaurants. Very convenient location, easy to get too . Very clean. Service was extremely good. Staff very polite and professional. Breakfast buffet was amazing. Restaurant inside was beautiful. Rooms were ready on time. Staff very accommodating. Train stations minutes walk. Would definitely stay there again ."
"I was extremely delighted with my last week stay in Novotel Siam Square.  From the concierge staff, to the receptionists and the house-keeping team, they offered heart-felt and attentive services with professionalism. To my very pleasant surprise, my room was well decorated with welcoming kits and message in appreciation of my loyalty. I am particularly impressed with the hand written welcoming card with elephant drawing, not forgetting the beautiful painting of Siamese mermaid on the mirror. The room was maintained at exceptional conditions and fresh with a bouquet of fresh flowers that made my day. Because of these extra miles effort in elevating my enjoyable experience staying in Novotel Siam Square, no doubt I shall keep coming back to this fabulous hotel - thanks and kudos"
"Novotel on Siam Square was a convenient location, centralized, having BTS and OneSiam Shopping Malls all within walking distance. The room and bedding were exceptionally clean. Bell staff was very helpful from helping with luggage to booking a taxi to the airport. Front Desk staff was professional and knowledgeable, making checking-in and checking-out a breeze. The hotel's breakfast was simple, great for a quick bite, but more flavorful foods can be found elsewhere. I made the reservation last minute and perhaps it was why the view from the room was not great. Overall, wonderful hotel with great service. Don't stay in rooms ending in 08, they face anugly wall, with half a view of Bangkok's skyline."
"This hotel has a very cool lobby! Check out the swings in the lounge area....Breakfast was not included and pricey, but the best we had on our entire trip. The rooms are stylish and very updated , that being said they aren't huge. The location is near the skytrain and all the mega malls."
"I have stay in this hotel at least once every 2 mths for the past decade. The location is perfect with a BTS interchange, the hotel went through a decent retrofit and the staffs are great. AND Mr BEN, the manager, is exemplary. He hold impeccable service and it people like him that make a hotel stay awesome!"
"The hotel was very kind to have my room complimentarily upgraded to a deluxe room. The room was newly renovated and clean unlike all the bad reviews that I have read before my stay. The hotel location is superb as it was stone throw away from everything you need.   Most importantly, the front desk agent, Poh, shown an exemplary customer service. She was very helpful and cheery while doing our check-in and check-out."
"Despite being absent for over a year I was welcomed as a friend with many staff remembering my name! Kuhn Fon, Mam, Vi and so many others are a credit to the hotel. Great rooms fabulous location - would thoroughly recommend"
Stayed 3 nights here. Good location as near Siam Paragon Mall. Rooms were clean but somewhat dated with old murals on walls. Breakfast breakfast buffet was fine and it came with room. Went to the Gormet bar to order a made to order sandwich which they advertise on the menu wall. Two times I was told I could not have made to order but choose one of two premise ones that looked old and did not have the ingredients I was wanting. Walked away both times disappointed. Don‚Äôt advertise it if you can‚Äôt deliver it.  Other than that it was ok. Staff helpful.
"Front desk staffs Ms Tok Tak and manager Toey were very kind and help me out with my very early morning check in. Thanks a lot for your hospitality.   The room is spacious, hotel well located near train station and shopping malls."
Very good hotel with amazing service great people just like the pictures and right in the center of everything with 4 minutes to Siam paragon mall and beautiful pool gym and spa and has a great view .
"Hotel was in a very good location; walking distance to lots of shopping malls. Starbucks and 7-11 just across the street. Lots of foot massage places available; fruit stand nearby. Hotel said it was newly renovated but already felt tired.  Minimalist and simple hotel room.   Honestly, breakfast was disappointing for the price and Bangkok expectation were high- was simply not met.  Furniture was very bulky so it was tight walking to the buffet.  Not very enjoyable. All in all, great location and good nights sleep."
"Near shops and restaurants but inconsistent services as I did not get face and hand towels the second day and limited amenities.. like ironing board, iron and apparently there were no room service, a little surprised if you need some late night snacks..    At 15 floor, there were loud noises from mid night to 4-5 am as well as unusual loud noises outside the room at early morning.. sleeps were really deprived.. made it hard for early meetings."
"Warm welcome upon arrival at the hotel and Ms.Gift, the receptionist was excellent and helpful on advising us on the locations nearby. Our stay was fantastic and we will definitely come back again. Hotel is at a strategic location and very convinient to move around by foot"
"Very good and excellent service by Toktak! Very kind and helpful   Good location, near Shopping centre located at Siam.   Easy access to shopping district   Nice ambience and hotel. A warm and welcoming experience"
"My partner and I celebrated our anniversary in BKK and we decided to choose this hotel due to the good reviews and location. Needless to say, we were not disappointed. Front desk staff were friendly and welcoming. They never fail to greet us with warm smiles whenever we return to the hotel. they helped us with our itinerary and on the last day, they helped us book our ride to the airport which saved us quite a bit of money. Would definitely choose this hotel if I decide to visit Bangkok again."
"I stayed first time at this hotel.  I vow the location of this hotel! In the ‚Äúheart of Bkk‚Äù. Many shopping malls are nearby.  Very very very helpful and kindly stuff, especially lady on reception Giff !  Not bad breakfast;)  Value for money üòä"
"Stayed for 3 nights. Hotel enjoys a great location in city centre, you can access all highlights quickly. The rooms are very comfortable and the aircon excellent. The breakfast is excellent with lots of choice. The best feature of the hotel however are the hotel personnel - friendly, professional, couldn‚Äôt do enough to make our stay memorable."
Fantastic location in the central hub of city and excellent service. Food wonderful and great help from Thomas & Jay. Tour desk ever so helpful with recommendations...we even mastered the BTS Skytrain. Pool a great help to cool down after a day of exploring!
"In Novotel for a night, great band playing some fantastic music. Made the bar very enjoyable.  Decided to stop in the bar whilst waiting for a friend to get into town for dinner plans and had the pleasure of being approached by the hand after their set, lovely chat and very friendly. New in town but hope they stay!"
I have stay in.this.hotel and this hotrl.is the best location in bangkok. The staff Mr. Top was very nice and.professional. He made my trip unforgettable. And Ms. Jess always has beautiful smile. And Mr. TAR Abiigal Andrian. I will come back again soon.
"Wonderful location, only a couple of minutes walk away from so many fantastic shopping places, and surrounded by so many good eateries and massage places.  The service here is also excellent. Tizz at the reception was exceptionally helpful in making arrangements to suit the needs of our stay. It is such service you find at novotel that keeps you coming back, holiday after holiday, year after year.  My mother and I thoroughly enjoyed our trip, and we‚Äôll be back again soon!"
Great location it just located across Siam Paragon. You can enjoy food no matter local or international around the same area. Pool is nice. However the room is not as expected and we need to clean my room ourselves as the carpet has too much dust. Lastly I have to say thanks for the reception because my booked car didn't come but I was hurrying to airport. Their reception provided me their car immediately. Much appreciated!
"The location is unbeatable, step out into Siam Square with Siam paragon , Siam BTS , a bit more to mbk , central world and platinum. Food massage shopping all surrounding the hotel for all pockets. Add to this the amazing butler- like service of Tizz, who really dedicated his time and kind attention to my mother, sister and myself, addressing all our needs with the best solutions he can come up with, making us feel so special ! Tizz is a real gem in the service sector , and I am really happy to be served by him. He is quick witted and earnest in devising the solutions, saving me much time and money, really grateful to him ! Would also like to thank the other staff at the front desk, luggage counter and security desk at the entrance of Novotel, they always greet us with a smile"
"Room not very tidy or clean Bed sheet , pillow case are dirty when I check in the room After complained, they changed it Toliet basin also not probably clean up No tooth brush was given, other Accor hotel will provide except BKK"
"The staff was wonderful upon check in and during our stay.  Upon Checkin we were assisted by Joy and Toktak, both were delightful. They were able to assist with early check in and late check out in one of our rooms. I love the location of the hotel. Its perfect to get to and from shopping and Skytrain. We will definitely stay there again."
"The staff in here are very nice and the location is good also. Me and my friend are very happy to stay in here, and we are sure we will come back to stay in here again . Staff susi and her training Abigail are very friendly  thanks"
We stayed here for 3 night we got a good experience with the staff. The trainee can speak Chinese and front desk very friendly and helpful for us. Thank you Abigail and her Manager Ms.Susy for all good take care for us.
"My family had a really great experience staying in Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square, The checking process is particulaly smooth thanks to the Customer Service in charge Ms. Poh. All information are on hand and ready making the check in really fast and at ease. Poh was also very attentive and offering all info and tips to make the stay and stroll to the neighbourhood easy with clear instruction.  Eveything is perfect, well done!"
"Just check into the hotel and was presented with an amazing service from front desk service officer, Tizz. From taking our details to answering our request and the extra step of providing more perks to our stay.   We are no stranger to this hotel, the hotel rooms could be slightly dated, but the location covered it all. With easy access to Siam Paragon, BTS and lots of food options here, it‚Äôs easily one of my fav hotel stay going forward.   Thanks Tizz, you have made the start of our holiday great!  Looking forward to enjoy our holiday here!"
Thank you Mr.Tizz handsome Receptionist and his team Jess.Picchy and Zusi. They are all very friendly to us and provide good service. They are very welcoming too!   Thank you for welcoming us to this hotel.
"I stayed 2 nights at Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square. The location was conveniently next to Siam BTS station and in the middle of the shopping/restaurant district, making it one of the most central hotel location within Bangkok.  The hospitality was outstanding, from Ms Tok Tak and Nynn who checked me in, to the lobby bar team (with live band) that was polite and patient even with my late drink orders.  The rooms were clean and well kept.  An established hotel of high standards and excellent location, a preferred accommodation option at Bangkok. Thank you and see you again :)"
We stay just one night and we came early in the morning surprisingly we got warm welcome from friendly staff named TIZZ. He arranged everything perfectly for us. We can get the room within 15 minutes despite in the very early morning. He has a good service mind and good manner. Politely speaking is his outstanding charisma.  We did not expect such impressive welcome because we thought Novotel may prefer Chinese or foreigner than Thais but we totally wrong.  Novotel will become first in mind when we choose next stay.  Chumchuwat family
"Excellent service from the hotel reception team of Gift, Bow and Soft. It‚Äôs Chinese New Year peak period at this popular hotel but the 3 of them were very patient and try their best to fulfil my peculiar room requirements, and always with a smile.  With such service, I‚Äôm already a satisfied and happy guest, not to mention they managed to find a suitable room.  Such service level is befitting of a 5 star hotel.  Good start to my holiday. Great thanks to these ladies."
"I always stay at novotel at siam square when I come to bangkok. It may not be the most luxurious or newest but it never disappoints. The location is remarkable with the bts a few steps away and the link bridge can bring me to a few places down the train line if I choose to take a walk instead.  Even though there are new faces at the front desks whenever I come, their service is always impeccable. They are always smiling and ready to help. I want to especially thank Toey, Kate and Pichy for being so accomodating and helpful. You gals make my day!"
"Thank you to Mr.Manop! I accidentally dropped my sunglasses at the front door. Mr.Manop kept it and passed to lost&found in its original condition. Besides, guards at basement level and front desk receptionists were very helpful as well. Great service indeed."
"All the personnel in the hotel is eager to help you with a smile on their face, the hotel is in a very good location near transportation and commerce.  The breakfast buffet is also very good, and the rooms are comfortable."
We booked to stay for 2 nights here. When we checking in the lobby very nice and all the staff are greeting us with Thai smiles. The lady short hair who help us to check in very helpful and politely.Thank you for all front desk again.I will recommend my friend to stay here
"Basic hotel so you don't have to move around too much, located in the shopping precinct and a short stroll to MBK shopping centre. Breakfast looked grand but not much of a variety.  Rooms are basic with no frills or whistles"
Stayed three nights at this Accor group hotel. Price was ok including breakfast.    Checkin was smooth and quick. Deposit of 1000 thb per night was collected. Not mentioned on booking.com.   Room was adequate. Stayed in 1502. The first night it had a rather unpleasant smell in it. I put it down to the sewage system. Smell disappeared the next day. Bathroom was a little grubby and in need of some maintenance. Bed comfortable and large. Plenty of space and a lovely city view. Good housekeeping.   Breakfast was fine. Not awesome but adequate and very busy.   Bar in the evening was good. Excellent selection of gin. Very impressive.   Overall a nice stay.
"Booked 3 months before arrival as Accor member with full advance room paid, still  doesn't get any priviledge. Would not recommend to any unless stay in newly renovated room. We were recommending, booked 2 rooms and stayed with friends to visit Bangkok for the first time unfortuneately not impresive."
"Good service and close to shopping centres and good restaurants. Zuni, Tizz, Soft and Bow helped us check in and provided us with vital information were friendly.  The lobby was very nice with music üëçüèºüëçüèºüëçüèº"
I travel few time a year to Bangkok and always stay at Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square. The Service is Excellent and all the staffs at Priority Lounge are very Helpful and Courteous especially Khun Poh.
"We were in Bangkok for the weekend and had such an amazing stay at the hotel. Joy, one of the night staffs, was so helpful and friendly in getting us checked in. Not only that, she went beyond to help us find a place to eat that late at night and even helped us call a Grab. We ended up in Patpong and had an amazing time browsing the market! Highly recommend this hotel. Oh! Definitely recommend the breakfast as well. It was DELICIOUS."
"We checked in at midnight for 8 days. The reception manager, Toey and Tehtak Nynn, are so considerate and upgrade a luxury room. The hotel is stylish design and very good location to the shopping malls in Siam. The ladies are polite and sweet to guests, very good customer service so highly recommended :)"
"Close to the Paragon shopping mall and not so far from the Bangkok Hard Rock Cafe. No complaints, the hotel is complying with what you would expect in most Novotel hotels from Acor franchise. good breakfast."
"I feel appreciated about the best service from your staff on night shift under name Toktak,Nynn,Toey,Joy. Thank you for big help. Good location near the shopping mall. Many food store around the hotel and easy to to the train station."
Stayed at different novotel resort around Thailand but this one stands out in terms of location and services offered.  All team members work hard to make sure you are enjoying holiday.   We really enjoyed there seafood buffet every night. Its truly amazing and value for money spent. It was fresh and service was amazing. The hotel Resident Manager Mr Michael specially came to check our table to make sure we are enjoying our meals.  All in all it was a great experience and we are already planning to visit again in near future.
"This is my first time staying in this hotel, it has very good location / convenient and has very friendly staffs. Piichy, is very friendly and extremely helpful in assisting my requests. I will come back again."
"This hotel does not really deliver the standards it claims and does not match Accor reputation. Positive points: location, bed quality, check in/out process, cleanness of rooms. Negative: overall staff with poor English, aged restaurants, noisy and jammed breakfast room, poor finishing quality of renovated bathrooms.  Better go to Vie hotel, Accor Group also, but better value for money."
"This is my second time staying at this hotel. The location is amazing, it's within walking distance to all the big shopping malls in Bangkok. The hotel service is excellent, especially the reception who helped me checked in, her name is Toktak. The deluxe room is really nice."
"Apart from the location, being right smack in the middle of Siam with easy public transport, there is nothing positive to comment about this hotel. It‚Äôs incredibly worn out, staffs are pretty inexperience and not too helpful, massage and spa is expensive (extremely old and dirty as well), bed and bathroom...TERRIBLE! Totally not worth the price. This hotel should really close down in order to keep up Accor‚Äôs good name"
"We stayed at this very central location hotel on our family stop over in Bangkok. Delighted with our choice, close to everything, giving us a chance to shop.  Good breakfast and enjoyed our time around the pool bar on level four."
Nice hotel - good location. Room is great and has all you need for your stay. Taktak at reception was very helpful especially after arriving from a delayed flight.  Housekeeping is very good - made up my room later in the day - thanks!
"Arrived at 1:00AM after long international flight and Toktak provided excellent front desk service and got me checked in quickly. I've stayed here many many times and for my money it has the best location, amentities, and staff in Bangkok. Right next to Siam Paragon and the Siam BTS station."
Hotel is located very centrally in the downtown Bangkok - almost next to the metro line. Plenty of restaurants and shopping in close vincinity. Rooms seem to have been renovated recently. Breakfast is good but prepare to wait to find a seat - long queues can be expected. Decent pool. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful.
"Novotel Siam Square is probably the best located hotel in Bangkok if you like a location near a convenient BTS station and central malls.    From the Siam Station, if you prefer not to carry your luggage down the stairs, you could use the escalators in the Siam Square One Mall.    The area around the hotel is a little untidy with motor cycle parking and not completely covered drains.    The hotel lobby has a funky vibe but is looking a little tired.     Our queen room was of a decent size, modern in design,  and most amenities were provided (kettle, slippers, bottled water etc).   The only issue of note was that the room was rather dimly lit though they corrected it by trolleying in a large lamp.    I also appreciated that they remembered my birthday with cake and congratulatory"
Renovated room with fresh look and more practical space. Good service and excellent check-in experience especially for an Accor Silver member. Breakfast is always good and good spread provided. Perfect location!
"Front desk service was exceptional from Nyyn. The location was perfect for our needs - as close as you can get to Paragon. Loved how close it was to a small, quiet temple that we visited. Amazing view from our room."
Nice location nice room and her up me to the new room with renovated and the hotel is very close to department store which we can walk to in a few minute. Thank to pichy to good take care us during the stay
"Upon arrival we were greeted by the staffs. This hotel is located in a very good location, staffs are friendly and helpful, room is clean and cozy. A must stay hotel when you are in Bangkok. Thanks to Nat and Toey"
"The deluxe rooms were supposed to have been revamped recently. But don't pay extra for them. In the bathroom, the soap holder was already rusting, walls cracking, floor gradient badly done, causing water to accumulate instead of flowing to the drain. Very poor workmanship. Doors slam shut so loud on every room, non existent soundproofing. You'd wake up early in the morning from all the door slamming and loud talking from the corridor. I could even hear hotel phones ringing from another room."
"Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square: After I raised a few concerns with my room, I went to the front desk and spoke with Kate The Duty Manager, who fixed my concerns and upgraded our room at no extra cost.  I was so relieved and shed tears as i was so thankful for her understanding, empathy, professionalism and kindness.  *******Kate Duty Manager turned my tears into Joy!*******  Kate made our trip memorable by mentioning my disability to all the staff that I came in contact with. I am disabled as I was ran over by a car as pedestrian. I have multiple injuries and health concerns. I use a rollator walker or wheelchair. Kate checked up with me by phone and in person around the Novotel.  *******I would highly recommend the Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square for people with a disability."
"Stayed here for a few nights with my family, Very convenient location to all the shopping malls and siam station, rooms are clean. Staff are friendly and attentative, would like to compliment Susy for being  very helpful."
I use to visit Bangkok once or twice a year. I stayed in other hotels in Bangkok when I visited Bangkok in the last two years but still found that Novotel Bangkok on Siam Square is still the best hotel with friendly greetings and excellent performance during my stays. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others.
"stayed for total of 6 Nights, the first 2 nights was excellent in term of service and cleanliness. the next 4 nights after returned from Vietnam was a bit frustrating. at first we were given a dull dark smoking room, after numerous complaint we were able to get a non smoking room. housekeeping after 2 nights began to deteriorate. but it still one of my favorite hotel in bangkok due to its location"
"The stay was excellent as usual. Just wanted to compliment the wonderful services of Poh, Tok Tak and Joy who were friendly and made the stay awesome. they were also informative and helpful. The staff who were in the lounges were great as always."
"The hotel is situated in a very strategic place where getting to tourist spots is a breeze with the central Siam station. Not to mention a few good Thai restaurant that is just 2 minutes walk away. Overall the hotel experience has been pleasent with friendly reception, welcome drink and clean hotel room. Amenities are decent too."
We stayed at Novotel for a couple nights for shopping. Everything is walking distance! All the malls and it‚Äôs only minutes away from subway. The property is neat and tidy. Our twin beds also seemed bigger than usual.  Friendly staff. They can improve on the front desk area. It‚Äôs a bit messy as there nowhere to line up. The lift was also a bit old.
"I have stayed at Novotel hotels across the globe and first time it was such a bad experience at the Bangkok on Siam Square.   Basic courtesy  issues from the staff and they ask customers to pay extra for no reason, they don‚Äôt understand language (which they should try to work and improve upon, especially in a hotel which has a global reputation.  1) The breakfast area where food was served had cockroaches roaming around 2) room is not cleaned up in time and staff says they had lot of rooms to clean up, such a lame excuse 3) they want to charge double for room service despite the rates being clearly mentioned on the room service menu, the staff is totally pathetic and then they serve half quantity liquor ordered in the room 4) they want to charge extra for providing  breakfast"
"Staff was very welcoming and friendly. They arranged to combine both my bookings such that I didn't need to change rooms after the first night. However, the room allocated to me was twin bed room with a toilet design flaw. In essence, when closing the window to the shower, the main room is able to see the toilet and when closing the toilet, the main room is able to see the shower. This made no sense especially with people sharing a twin room. Spoke to the duty manager and they managed to move me another room where the toilet had no issues with privacy the following morning. Appreciate the quick and prompt service recovery. Other than this incident, the stay was great. Location was very near the Siam BTS station (2 min walk) and lots of food options / malls. Siam Paragon was just"
"I am visiting this hotel since merely twenty years, mainly due to its location. This time was  very mixed experience.  Check in took twenty minutes, despite nobody in front of me. Just slow staff. Finally reaching the room, both provided key cards didn't function,and the door could not be opened. Returned to reception, after further ten minutes, I had two new keys, which worked.  Due to my status, I received welcome drinks vouchers for the bar. Pretty much to my surprise, I was told, today no beer on stock - can you imagine ? Only imported brands, but those not on voucher. However, next day local beer on voucher was available.  Thought over the years, I would know ll the room types, and wouldn't need adapters s three pin sockets be available. However, when doing work, I"
