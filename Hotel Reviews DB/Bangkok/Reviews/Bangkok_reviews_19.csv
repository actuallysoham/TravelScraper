"Convenient location, suitable accommodation. The air-con is pretty noisy. During this complicated time of COVID19, this hotel suffers from the comparison with other similarly priced hotels though. I'd say it is an OK choice for a short stay, with nothing particularly outstanding. I would consider alternative places with better facilities and service for longer stays."
"This is not new hotel, but in very-very good condition. Huge room, absolutely clean. Nice location - 2 BTS Skytrain stations in walking distance. Silom Night Market and Patpong Night Market 12-15 minutes calm walking. A lot of street food places, restaurants and 7-11 around. Only smiles at the reception ) 2 bottles of free water. Lunch buffet for 89 THB is attracting many many people, so come earlier! Choice is good, food is tasty and typical Thai. 100% recommended."
"A lovely hotel that graciously upgraded our room free of charge. Great facilities and a good buffet breakest. It's in a good location close to restaurants, 7-Eleven and the BTS. Nui the room attendent was very helpful and friendly."
"I was fortunate enough to be stuck in Thailand during the COVID lockdown. The staff here is amazing, they have taken great care of me.  The housekeeping staff, especially Panisa (Nui), has gone above and beyond to make my stay comfortable, clean, safe and enjoyable.  The area is relatively clean and quiet. Room service food is delicious and reasonably priced."
"I stayed here for about a month and a half, because it was one of the few hotels in Bangkok that met all of my requirements, which were: kitchen in the room and a swimming pool/gym at a decent price. The price, in fact, was greatly reduced due to   the COVID crisis, and I got a free upgrade the day I arrived! It's a kind of business-style hotel, and the rooms are fairly spacious. The place is in the heart of Sathorn, down a small alley and surrounded by the chaos of the city, not far away from the BTS. The staff was helpful and welcoming, and addressed any problems I had. I think for the price it's hard to beat at the moment. The only negative thing I can think of is the free newspaper in the lobby -- it's (Chinese) propaganda!"
"Really love this hotel since the first day with nice and friendly staff, foods are delicious. Fitness and swimming pool are quite and provided alcohol gel during covid-19. All precesses which is concerned with virus are safe and hygiene. I like view from the room. Worst it."
"We were amazed by how nice the room was as we didn’t expect much from it due to the low price. The hotel was nice and clean and we got a nice city view on the 10th floor. Our room has a bathtub, a big refrigerator, and a cooking space but unfortunately there wasn’t any pots and pans we can cook. But we were happy enough with what we were given. At first we weren’t happy with the A/C because of its loud noise but the engineer came and it was kind of a bit better. Front desk Mr. Mint was kind and provided us everything we need. You might want to look for him when you come to stay. They also have a pool and gym. Seriously, can any hotel be anymore valuable!? Also, breakfast was nice and worth the price!"
"Tucked away behind the Bangkok Bank HQ and just a short walk from Chong Nonsi BTS, this property offers an ideal base for city exploring or business commitments in the CBD. The front desk team members are charming, well-trained and have excellent English language skills. Duty Manager Khun Prim is a real gem. Very helpful indeed. The restaurant menu includes a variety of popular Thai dishes at sensible prices. Limited parking but the hotel is easily accessible by taxi and on foot from the BTS station. Excellent value and highly recommended."
Enjoyed a 2 week stay. All hotel services were exceptional. Staff most accommodating. Room very quiet and comfortable. A prime location located between Silom and Sathorn Roads. Will be back again next year.
"Actually is 2 months that I live at furama exclusive sathorn and I really advise it.location very good near Bts and near lumpini Park.Very different kinds of rooms.staff very kind.price very convenient.i spend lot of the time at swimming pool, but this is my personal choice. At the end Furama International Hotel it's a garanty !!!"
The rooms are very old and noisy. We booked the premier room for 800thb (prices are low because if covid) we also paid 700thb extra for breakfast. I think from all the hotels in my life this was the worst breakfast ever. The staff is nice and the serivce is oke. But for this breakfast i will go to 7eleven next time. And will all the noise in the hallway maybe its also better to sleep at the 7eleven;)
"We are staying at Furama X Sathorn for a few weeks now. Prim, Mey, Tak and all the staff are great and friendly. Location is good, near everything and Lumpini Park for walks Tom and her coworkers keep the rooms very clean."
"Good location (near BTS and MRT), clean and comfortable rooms with small kitchen, professional staff.  The staff was very nice and polite. The restuarant was also good. Everything was excellent. Good place for both short and long stay."
"The staff here are professional, polite and always there to help. Especially the female manager, who by the way has a great haircut and Mint who dealt with anything I needed.  The rooms vary so make sure you ask for what you would like, I prefer a large bed, walk in shower and a view.  So they gave me the 12th floor perfect... Slept well, comfy rooms with small kitchen area.  Pool area and gym a great bonus.  The breakfast was free and plenty to choose from, only thing need improvement is the coffee which is a machine so not great. Everything else, cleaning service, room cleaning staff excellent and friendly. Very near Chong nonsi so good for exploring.  When visiting Bangkok I would definitely return."
Housekeeping and reception staff were fantastic during our three day stay including the trainee receptionist who was excellent. WiFi was good. On the negative side - Room 212 is to be avoided at all costs unless you like a very dark and depressing room. We were moved to 10th floor (again handled excellently by staff). However new room whilst much better re windows had a much smaller bed and a shower in a bath which flooded the bathroom every time. The shower broke but again was fixed extremely promptly. No walk-in shower like similar rooms. Air con was very effective. Worst experience was food at the hotel. A group of 24 of us ate the first night. Food was cold. Breakfast in three mornings was also cold and very little choice. Our worst experience of hotel food ever. No winder
"City hotel We had a fair size room which had a small kitchen Two ring hob,kitchen sink and loads of kitchen cupboards!!! Bathroom fine Good hot water Air con worked well Very large bed We were told not all rooms are so good No bar area and if you do get a drink they are expensive £10 for a glass of red wine😡 We had an organised dinner for a group which turned out to be a disappointment 👎"
"I booked a good deal for this hotel with Agoda (recommended for booking hotels in SE Asia).  Great location next to Chong Nonsi BTS stop and easy walking to Silom/Sala Daeng.  The hotel staff were friendly although they did initially send us to the wrong room - they corrected their mistake quickly, as we had only just taken off our shoes.  Once settled in the correct room, it was spacious and clean.  In the morning there was a free breakfast buffet - the coffee was not good but I was happy to get a plate of free fresh fruit.  Overall I had a pleasant stay and if I need to be in this area again, I wouldn't hesitate to choose this hotel."
"The hotel is located centrally near Patpong, it is getting old and in need of renovation. The rooms are quite large and the bath too, but the bath with a shower is a bit suicidal when you start to get old and stiff so only the shower had been better. the pool area was not that impressive either, the pool was ok but there was no bar where you could order food or drink. The breakfast is like in many other places where it is a bit cheaper, there are not so many Western products and more Asian dishes. If you are traveling through one or two days and do not set such high demands on the pool area then it is ok, on a romantic holiday you will probably need a little more."
"I was with a group and the staff made us feel very welcome, the rooms were comfortable and clean , the kettles were a bit crazy you got 2 bottles of water a day but it took pretty much all that to cover the minimum level. It is a good hotel but possibly not the best location in Bangkok but there were some markets nearby to explore and maybe 20 mins away visit Lumpini Park and try the coffee shop nearby."
"Great location close to Chongnonsi and Saladaeng BTS and to Silom MRT. The neighbourhood is one of the coziest in Bangkok. Close to Lumphini Park and Silom Rd. The view from the rooms are breathtaking. I really liked the pool area, which was sunny talmost half of the day even if the area is mostly high risers.  P'Lookpla and P'Tom were amazing hosts!"
"The hotel is in a very busy and well connected area but being on a side road it's  quite. The room was clean, although not new, and very big with a bed room and living room. The fabric of the sofa and the bathroom were a bit worn out. Breakfast and pool were just ok. From the pictures the hotel looks fancier than it actually is. Also, some of the pictures posted on tripadvisor are wrong, the actual dining room is the one with the orange and blue chairs, not the fancy one with wood chairs and sofas. It's a very standard Hotel, but being clean and quiet it's good value for money. We booked a room for three people but, when there, we were told we had to pay extra for the third person's bed and breakfast. Maybe it was our mistake when booking? I don't know, anyway be careful about"
"First time I stay in this hotel staff very friendly especially Ms.Nokweed, Mr.Karn very good service breakfast is very nice and room so good. Hotel have swimming pool near by sky train reception very helpful Mr.Adam, Mr.Tum I hope come back to this hotel again for next time."
Room is clean and nice staff here so friendly and service is good like stay home .. location is easy to go every where cos near bts . Near by hotel also have resturant easy to get food and local market in the day time
"We were greeted with a friendly smile and kind gestures. We rarely receive such friendly attitude at desk counters but here you get the whole nine yards. Thank you to thing thing , Porsche, Tak lookpla for their friendly and amazing service at this hotel. Keep up the amazing work"
"Nice hotel in a very central location yet nice and quiet.  Reception were very helpful on arrival and made the checkin easy, especially one of the staff named Lookpla.  On site parking nice and convenient.  Would be happy to stay here again."
"We love the Furama hotel in Sathorn, they really make you feel like you're coming home. The staff at breakfast always remember us and want to have a quick chat on our arrival.  Location is another plus but the main reason we continue to come is the people who look after us during our stay."
"Cet hôtel est très correcte.very clean.very welcome.hearty breakfast and excellent service.Thanks at San, Can, Karn, nok weed.I recommend this hotel with confidence.see you soon. Thanks very welcom all"
"The location of this hotel is extremely convenient with BTS Chong Nonsi Station less than 5 mins walk. Plenty of taxis and tuk-tuk readily available outside hotel entrance. Wide array of restaurants, cafes and street food around the hotel. Staff service were impressive. Room is a little dated but comfortable and spacious. Breakfast spread was good for this price. Highly recommended!"
"I stayed here for 3 nights from feb8-feb11, first of all an agency chose the hotel and we were immediately unimpressed after checking in. The hotel was located in a weird alleyway, hard to find and away from all the liveliness of the town and city, we had to drive everywhere! Secondly, the rooms were old and dirty, our shower wasn’t clean when we checked in, one of the two elevators didn’t work.  HERE’S THE WORST OF IT ALL!!! After I checked out, I headed for breakfast thinking all is good, then on my way out the door someone yells after me(mind you it’s 7am and the lobby was filled with ppl waiting for their transportations and some checking out). I walk over to the desk and the guy behind the desk with gloves on is picking out my towels from my room from plastic bag and going"
"Coming to Bangkok,many times always stay here.very clean;staff very friendly; good lacation next to the BTS.line. The food very good love the breakfast  And lunch. I do higley recommended. The staff here know how to look after the turismo. And they also have a knowledge of Bangkok,wich is very handy. And speak inglesh very well."
"Location wise, it's near BTS station and easily accessible to Silom area as well.  Front Office Clark Ms. Namaoy and Ms. Khanom are friendly and had smooth check out.  The room I stayed at needs a bit of touch up.  Other than that, I'm satisfied."
"We stayed at this hotel for two nights and we can recommend it. The room was clear. The staff was very helpful and nice. My boyfriend lost his phone in the taxi und the staff (Adam and Thing Thing Tum) helped us immediately, they called the taxi driver and my boyfriend got his phone back. We are very thankful for that!  The breakfast was very delicious with a big choice of food.   Only the lady at the taxi service in the hotel did not meet up our expectations. We just wanted to get a taxi from the hotel to Grand Palace. She wanted to sell us a sightseeing package and said that we couldn‘t see the temples without this package. At the end we had to get a taxi on our own. We didn‘t have any problems seeing the temples. And we even needed less money than the package had cost.   All"
"The staff are welcoming. Full equipment in the room There is a swimming pool, fitness, washing machine ready to live like a condo. Breakfast has a medium selection. Dinner is ok They work hard, rose pure kan Thank you everyone so much"
Have no words. It's one of the most comfortable stay we ever experienced. The front desk staff is so welcoming it almost feels at home. Tak rose thing thing and everyone there is so helpful and accommodating. They just take care of everything for you. A small cozy dining place in the lobby is state of the art and all the amenities provided are absolutely enough and perfect.  I will definitely would love to stay there on my next trip. They out of the way took care of my lil one. At odd hours they provided food for my baby. Thank you so much for making my stay so comfortable.
"Very friendly staff, Nice to children, helpfull, Nice rooms, breakfast is good everyday fresh noodles, and welcomed by the lovely smiles from Nokweed, Karn, San. Visiting Bangkok again we would definitly book this hotel again"
"No complaints. Excellent little hotel. Self service laundry is very useful & well looked after. Housekeeping staff are all pleasant & professional. Nokweed, New, Tea & Adam are great staff & always helpful. Would definitely stay again."
I stay here with the group and I would like to thank some nice staff Nui from housekeeping has taken good care of me. Lookpla and Mint from the front office has given me great smiles throughout the day . I feel very happy to receive such nice welcoming. I will surely come to stay here again.
"Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of SE Asia tour.  I'm usually a little unsure of hst to expect of hotels in large cities.  I'd consider this a hidden gem.   Location was excellent short walk from metro station.  Staff were very helpful  the room spacious and clean, very small gym area and a nice swimming pool.  Breakfast had limited choice but was more than ample.    Overall a great stay."
"It was the first time we stayed in this hotel. We were first welcomed by the staff in the check in counter. They found that we had been a VIP member so we were upgraded to a higher level. The staff Namaoy, Khanom and Tak were very polite and helpful."
"Review as non-staying customer. Thai food and steak are cheap and tasty, come with free salad bar and ice cream. Waiter clearly explain available menu and promotion. Food served in few minutes. Waiter list / รายชื่อพนักงาน สันต์ โรส เพียว ก้าน"
"This hotel is not exactly new, but the room condition is still nice. The room they gave me this time is with city view and not facing Hotel at the back. Thank you so much for the friendly male reception staff for this free room upgrade.  Many eating places and convenience shops around the hotel. BTS is 5-10mins walking and Silom Complex also is about 10mins walking. Breakfast is simple with asian and western food. Overall, it is s good stay."
"When you want someone is polite and friendly, here you can have first class service in real time. Even one night staying, I already know stuff by names when they follow my wishes. In security, they very helpful also when I needed to ask some services.   Not so many places with this value have so good service and feel enough luxury. Thank very much for example Rose, Nok Weed, Namaoy, Adam and many others who make my visit and feelings good about Thai people.   I felt very welcome here. Sure next time my choice when visiting embassy.  Even city area, you can find original Thai life in small roads , local restaurants and many other services. Even you travel in business, you feel like holiday with swimming pool, outside coffee place, big restaurant and so on. And also, there is 7/11"
"Friendly and service minded staff(Namaoy, Khanom and Porsche . Nice rooms, good breakfast. Great location. Big busy area. On walking distance to Silom Rd. I come here often, they always are kindful and helpful."
"Everything is great except WiFi could be little slow or giving issue at night. Breakfast is great. I recommend people to choose breakfast when they book the hotel. Phim, and Mint are very welcoming and respectful, as well as other associates. Everybody is very welcome. Area is very safe and not too far from central."
Nice hotel the reception girl Namaoy is really nice! Food and drinks arranged by Rose and Nam was really good allot of around the world choises. The people that work here are super polite. The pool was very clean and a good temprature
"Very good location if you have to go to the embassy also near the shopping airia.   Very friendly staff especially the girls at the reception, thingthing and Namaoy Lookpla. Super good breakfast aswel.  The room where I stay could use an upgrade, some details in the bathroom where missed aswel."
"Location was great & the staff (Thing2, Namaoy/Maew) were really good. They upgraded my stay to better which is more spacious .  Maybe the hotel is old, hot/cold shower is inconsistent. But still OK for me 😁"
The receptionist are friendly especially thing thing prom and mint. They’re helpful and guide us to where we want to go tell us the way and they speak in a polite way. Patient in the way of answering us question.
"Excellent Hospitality especially from the kitchen Crew ..San, Pure and Rose ..  great meal ..Good gym and amenities   Rooms were done up well, thoroughly enjoyed my stay   I will recommend this hotel to my other colleagues   keep up the good work"
"I have been stay in this hotel several times, the location is great with 5 mins walk to skytrain station, 10 minutes to night market. The room is spacious and clean. All staff is nice and helpful especially the tall manageress, Namaoy and Mint."
"I stayed in this hotel just for a night but I was really appreciated! First receptionist name ‘mint’ helped a lot with kindness. The hotel is in a good location, near BTS and many restaurants around. Gym and pool are clean. Many choices for breakfast with a delicious taste."
For last year i stayed here for business to long time and this year i’m also come here again the staff very very lovely and friendly.  Khanom Mayom Tak and another staff’s thank you very much for help us everything.  ICE
"Good hotel with very nice staff. The room was spacious and clean. Bathroom has pretty big showers, sink and toilet. Was very clean as well. There is also a kitchen within the room. I liked the location- only a few minutes walking from the Skytrain station. There are a lot of restaurants in this area and night markets as well. Breakfast was nice. The pool is small, but still enough for a relax in the bustling city of Bangkok."
"I stayed here for 3 mths & felt like at home. All the staff are very friendly & helpful. The front desk staff help me with a lot of requests such as to book grab for me, etc... front desk staff: Adam, Mint, Thing Thing, Mayom, Khanom, Nam Aoy and Lookpla. Very very dedicated staff.   And not forgetting the manager Ms Prim, MsTak & night shift staff.  Bellboys - Porsche and Tam and one more (sorry, forgot your name). Very good service.  Restaurant supervisor - Mr San and Nokweed and Rose. Hard working and good service as well.  Housekeeping - Mdm Tu. She does her work meticulously   And the rest of the staff that i have spoken to or met but forgot their names.  Will stay here next time when im back for business trip.   From Latiff"
"Stayed last December, and now in January. I was surprised with the extra kindness of the hotel staff! They made sure the guests are doing ok. Our room was upgraded with a living room and an extra bedroom. Very spacious. I wanted a kitchen so I can cook simple dishes but only the smaller rooms have a kitchen. I think they should make a bigger gym. It was so small. We had to book at the nearest gym for a month although we stayed in Bangkok for only 10 days. And because we go to the gym, we really need a washer and dryer in the room. They have a laundry space but with only 2 washers and 1 dryer so we had to wait for the others to finish in order to use it. They should provide baskets to put finished laundry just in case the owner doesn't pick their laundry on time so others can use"
"Furama Xclusive Sathorn could have been a perfect choice if only it's located in the city center. The hotel itself is nice. Although not new & modern, it's clean & well-maintained. The lobby also smells nice & they offer complimentary pandan juice.   The room is spacious. For the price that we paid for, we were not expecting a huge 1-bedroom suite with a living room & another large TV apart from the one in the bedroom. There's also 2 airconditioning units, 1 in the bedroom & 1 in the living room. Plenty of storage space, too. The other room that we got, on the other hand, is a studio type with a kitchen & large refrigerator. Complimentary bottled water is replenished everyday.  We were also satisfied with their service. Everyone was very nice, accommodating, & helpful."
"This is a relatively small and friendly hotel well located and with very pleasant helpful staff.  Particular mention of Mint and Thing Thing who made me feel welcome when I checked in.  Also Nok Weed, Pure, Karn and Kan at breakfast."
The Hotel is very nice and it’s located in walking distance to Skytrain. There are so many restaurants around the hotel and 7-11 which make you comfortable. The hotel staffs are also very nice. They are willing to provide for good services especially Mint and Namaoy. I’m so happy with this hotel and next time I will come back again.
"Thanks the service of Nuli and Lookpla!!! They are very kind and nice for the room clean service, on time and professional. It is my pleasure to have the stay in this hotel. Also like to visit BKK again"
"The Furama XClusive is like a hidden jem of nice hotel in Bangkok.Location is not far from Skytrain which operate till midnight.Surrounding the hotel have seafood local restaurant,24 hours convience store which make you comfortable.Swimming pool and fitness also make you enjoyable.And very nice & friendly team are amazing..  Big thanks Prim,Namaoy,Rose,Pure and Nokweed..keep continue your professional service and we'll come back to stay with your hotel again.  Strong recommendation for this hotel for someone who looking for the hotel around skytrain."
I just want to thanks to Ms Nok Weed for the amazing room service during my stay. Such as friendly and helpful I couldn’t ask anything more. And thanks again for making my NYE party fun in Bangkok so now I can look forward to 2020!
"Very nice Hotel with friendly stuff ( Namaay and Adam ). Got a free upgrade to room 303 🎉🎉🎉. If they give a free breakfast will be great 😬. Very clean , nice swimming pool, and very strategic location, close to silom and tourist area. Surely will comeback and stay here."
Helpful front desk staff changed our rooms after the first one was too noisy. Great pool walking distance to BTS. Comfortable rooms with New beds and linen and great pillows. Great housekeeping especially Nui. Plenty of bottled water in rooms.
"Great position in Si Lom. Rooms are big, comfortable and clean . The breakfast is very good with a lot of choice. Staff is super kind, special thanks to Adam and Namaoy. We strongly recommend this hotel."
Is good hotel near sky train very good staff ms.namaoi Mr.Adam and Mr. Beer very assistances breakfast very nice near Silom road room it ok clean and comfortable we will come back again to this hotel.
"I stayed  here around 3 months for business. The hotel was good , breakfast was really great and expectedly the staffs here have a great attitude and service mind. I would  like to thank you Khun Namaoy, Khun Adam, Khun Nokweed, Kan, Khun Rose, Khun Kan, Khun Nam, Khun Sun, Khun Karn, Khun Pieow a lot for your great services."
I know hotels around this area well and I select where to stay depending highly on the prices offered. This time Furama was a good deal. I know what to expect from this hotel and it did not disappoint me.
"price is reasonable, location is good, the room is clean.  show curtain can't block the water well, water leak to the floor easily after showering.  Room service staffs Ms. Noi and Ms. Pom are good at attitude."
This hotel is just of 3 mins walk to BTS. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The room is spacious and clean. It is an ideal choice for travellers who like night life and local food too. The only issue is about the air conditioner which is a bit noisy. This is common for many central air conditioning anyway. But it can be turned off if you do concern about the noise.
The hotel was nice.The staff  are very helpfy.And also the food was exerence.the location is nice in the centrr of the city very easy to go every where.The staff name Khun Nam Khun Pure Khun Rose and Khun Nok weed they are so nice and look after the clint very well and I appreciate so much.
We had a great visit to Bangkok and stayed a the FuramaXclusive hotel. We had a fantastic room and the staff was great. Very kind and great service. Especially Miss Rose and Nok Weed. Thank you for the great experience.
During our holiday we stayd in this hotel. We had a big room with an extra big room. The breakfast was very good and the people are very friendly. If you are looking for a good hotel in Bangkok this is a good choice
Rose is very swift and the serviced very well. She is an asset to the Hotel and based on her hard work I am sure she will achieve many more milestones in her career. New year 2020 will bring her lot of prosperity n which her all succeaa
"Got upgraded to executive suite - very huge and clean.  The hotel is located near the BTS station, and the staff are very helpful and welcoming!   Special thanks to Tak, Prim, Thing Thing, Namaoy, Khanom and Mayom for the birthday surprise!"
We've stayed at Furama few times since 2006. It was quite experience and trendy hotel then with lot's of Western tourists. Then we we witness how it became overpriced place with a bit tired amenities.  Nowadays it is affordable very nice located old (sorry guys) hotel with very warm and friendly atmosphere. The shift with Mayom and Khanom Lookpla was so helpful checked un us tired from a long flight as soon as they could. Many thanks and Christmas greetings for lovely young Ladies. Keep going like that and your place will be very popular for a long time more. PS. Breakfast is very good as well
Great location only 200m to the nearest BTS and on the same line to the Silom and MBK shopping areas. Excellent value from the generous room sizes to the quality breakfasts. Very friendly and helpful staff.
"I have during countless trips to Bangkok stayed in several hotels.  Furama Xclusive Sathorn has turned out to be my preferred choice.   Besides tbe value for money,  having both a swimming pool and a smaller f gym,  the location is extremely convenient and peaceful despite being in a very eventful area of Bangkok.   The staff has always been extremely flexible, friendly and helpful whatever I have needed and making me feel home and relaxed.   In general all have been nice to me amongst the very kind housekeeping staff. From the front desk I have always been greeted by Mint, Namoya, Phol and Tak whom always greets me kindly ""welcome home""  If above sounds appealing to you then this hotel is a great choice.   Brds  Thomas Stadler Nielsen"
The staff was very welcoming and nice. They offered us lemon grass juice and a plate of fruits just as we arrived. The room was spacious and clean and had an amazing view! The area is close to almost everything you'd need.
"We had a amazing holiday in this hotel, everything was super fine! We had an amazing employee in the restaurant her name is Nok Weed , she is such a good person thank you for making our holiday so good!"
"I always stay in this affordable hotel whenever I am in this area. Although the area is home to many new and chic hotels, Furama Xclusive Sathorn provides value for money. The hotel is well maintained and it is near the BTS and eateries.  This time, I am impressed by the staff's amazing service. I requested not to stay in a certain room because part of the king size bed is under the false ceiling. Khun Thing and Khun Tee not only acceded to my request, they unexpectedly upgraded me to a premiere suite."
"I used this hotel for about 2 months for a long stay.  The hotel is a bit old, but no problem.  The temperature of the bath water is slightly lower. ( Is this Thailand culture??)  The staff were all kind and helpful, especially Ms.Thing Thing,Ms.Tak,Ms.Namaoy!!  If I have the opportunity, I want to use this hotel again."
The room is nice and big. Very near to BTS station. Friendly staff like Ms. Namaoy and Mr. Mint. Breakfast fast also nice. Many street foods and restaurants around the hotel. You can enjoy your stay with FurumaXclusive Sathorn. WiFi also fast.
"I would like to thank khun khanom, adam, tum, eiang and joom for the wonderful service! Special thanks to the front desk for helping us claim back our lost item, we are very grateful for their excellent service and continuous smiles.  The hotel is also located in a wonderful area around many street food stalls, aesthetic cafes and a BTS station less than 5 mins walk away. I will definitely highly recommend:)"
"I really love this hotel & stayed at here for more than 8 times. Reasons, they have good breakfast, room maintained very clean and spacious. friendly, helpful & polite staffs who help me during my late check in (Their name are May, Thing, Aoy & Porsche). Would also thank you to house keeper auntie tidy my room every day. I will come back again Furama Xclusive Sathorn 😬❤💛💚💙💜. One more thing, restaurant crews always smile and great you every morning and make my lovely day."
"I just lived there for one night but their kind service impressed me a lot. Especially thanks Mayom, Khan, Adam, Tim. They are just too nice and sweet. When I checked out they double checked if I left anything and found I left my medicine in the closet. Really appreciate them for being so kind. Definitely will revisit it next time."
"A nice hotel with a good location close to the Skytrain. The service is excellent, and the personell are very polite. Mayom and Lookpla treated us very well, and upgraded our regular room to a suite upon check in, a very nice gesture. Breakfast is very good. Only downside with the hotel is that some of the rooms could need a light renovation."
"A nice and cosy hotel.Very close to the bts.Also very quiet even though it's quite near the street. I would reccomend you some great staff such as Miss Mayom,Mr. Mint,Miss Namaoy, and Miss Lookpla. They are very nice,they always smile and give me good service.Thank you"
I would like to say thank you to Kun Namaoy mint She provide a very good service to the hotel guess I have a package Will deliver to this hotel Kun Namaoy mint Help me make a phone call to confirm my package will arrive at this hotel in time before I check out. Thank you very much Kun Namaoy mint
"Nice hotel, good and clean rooms. Close to the metro line. Nice and helpful staff? 7-eleven close by.  Good place to start exploring metro: quick in town, and other direction in few minutes by ferries.  Next time I will book this hotel again."
"I’ve just checked in at Furama Xclusive Sathorn & the experience has been lovely & smooth from beginning to end. Lookpla, Namaoy, Mint & Prim greeted me with wide smiles & seamlessly checked me in while continuing to chat with me & make me comfortable. They also kindly upgraded my room due to unavailability of the room type booked for me. I will definitely be coming back to Furama Xclusive Sathorn during my next Bangkok visit. Keep up your good work Lookpla, Namaoy, Mint & Prim😀"
"The hotel staff is very friendly.  The house keeping Nui is very helpful she always assist me when I need room cleaning.Nokweed was very nice to me when I went to have breakfast.And last but not least the front office Lookpla is very cute,she always smile.  Furama has many lovely staff and service. I am very happy ,thank you"
"stayed at the hotel with my family for 10 nights. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Our special appreciation to Mayom, Thing Thing at the reception desk, Nok Weed and San for the excellent breakfast service and Mr Joe for the transport arrangement. The room was spacious but was a bit outdated. Location was accessible to BTS station. We enjoyed our stay"
Stayed here with my family on 12th of october. The check in was quick and the staff was very cordial and nice. The parking space is on the ground floor and very convenient. The breakfast can be better with more vegetarian options. We were even  upgraded to a better room.  Highly recommended.

"Whenever I come to Bangkok on business trip, I book room in this hotel. Very friendly and helpful staff and the rooms are also great. Only change I would request to have dessert in free breakfast menu. Rest all is great One of the staff (Pure) remembers that I had brought my son once and always enquires about him...☺️"
