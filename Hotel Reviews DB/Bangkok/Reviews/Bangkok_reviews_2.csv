"We truly enjoyed our trip at the Chatrium. The staycation package is such a great deal including the scrumptious dimsum buffet. All dishes were great! Our room was also upgraded to a spacious suite with the fantastic river view. We are thankful for the staff (K.Wasin, K.Amita, and K.Lalita) who assisted us with the check in. In particular, I would like to thank K.Wasin for showing us the room and providing us tips during the stay :) We shall return and look forward to our next stay!"
"Very good and big clean room with nice service. I stayed at Room 2106 with good service of Khun Kuakul, the floor 's housekeeping, as she is so friendly and always made gave best service to me.

It was the best two nights get away. The facilities are great. Staffs nice and friendly. Awesome view! Large room! The swimming pool area is so big. Breakfast is perfect. The only thing I have a problem with was slow running water in the shower. But my holiday was great anyway! Thank you k. ‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏π‡∏• for birthday song and flowers. You and the teams are thoughtful minded!
"Another enjoyable coffee  and cake at the lobby lounge! The team there are always polite, professional and smiley. Think it‚Äôs great the care they take to remember your name as it makes you feel really cared for. Thanks, will be back soon."
Mr. Wichai from concierge was very polite and helpful.  He assisted us in getting a taxi and filled us in on what to do in the area. His personality was great and I will return to Cahtrium because of the location and street walk.
"Beautiful hotel, super courteous and friendly staff.  The room, a suite with a wonderful view, was huge, with a living room and kitchen, an exception to the breakfast, plentiful, there was everything and everything was of excellent quality.  I really feel like recommending this hotel."
We had a great stay in a 2 bedroom suite! Our two boys loved the pool and the breakfast buffet! The hotel water taxi was convenient and fun to use. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. We would definitely stay here again!
"Have a great time with friends at this hotel, very good taste at Dim Sum buffet, spacious room with breathtaking view.  Special thanks to K. Nat and K. Chai at concierge desk who always make sure that our stay is top notch."

"My wife and I stayed at the CHATRIUM hotel with great happiness for different things. We were in room 2713 for half a month, this room represents all the quality of this hotel the Housekeeping service, efficient, helpful, always good mood. An exceptional view, pleasant and functional comfort. Felt like the home perfect time to stay here ... the hotel is clean all the staff is very friendly and very professional especially VARAPORN - the Guest service at reception and her team are amazing very helpful always greeting us with a smile. SUPANNEE and RAKSINA - efficient, calm, and on the lookout for all operations, restaurant waiter and their team have always impressed me and my wife by recognizing what we need, smiling, and providing very good service. We are very happy to vacation"
"The room is nice and well cleaned. River view from 33th floor look pretty amazing at 5-6 pm. Hotel staff greets us with friendly faces and politely, always feels like home every time. Highly recommend!"
"great, friendly, polite, effective, beautiful. We suggest this accomodation for many families in adoption process!!! Pool is a good safe situation for a child, starting to play and know his/her parents"
"My second flight to Bangkok and I chose this hotel for a riverside location at an affordable cost.  Excellent from all points of view, convenient with the boat transfer, good restaurant, perfect breakfast. Beautiful room overlooking the river.  I'll be back"
"Stayed here this week following a purchase of attractive dim sum voucher package. Check in was a hassle-free feeling where I contacted hotel an hour prior via FB messenger telling I was about to arrive at 1.30pm. The hotel admin was quickly prompted in accepting my request and made sure my check-in was prepared. They explained even clearly in details that my room would be ready however an additional request I made at short notice might not be ready. There was no problem for me at all.  I arrived at the hotel by driving and this hotel provided a convenient car parking space where I just hopped from where I parked to the elevator which connected me right to the lobby reception. With luggage I had, I did not have any difficulty at all.  I was revived warmly at the reception by"
This is our first time visit and we will definitely come back.  They have such a friendly staff and ambience environment.  Quality service and spacious room is beyond expectation!  We have a river view room and both sun set and sun rise moment is breathtaking.  Welcome drink is great.  Thanks to Kuakul‚ù§Ô∏è
I spent 1 night in this hotel as the first time visit. It's a great and remarkable experience by Riverside. Hotel staff are all excellence in exceeding guest 's expectations.  Seafood at Pier is a best choice for an evening romantic dinner with a river view besides you.  I only recommend this hotel to all and Kudo to all Front Desk team.
"The room is spacious, clean, has an open balcony to sit and watch the view, with a kitchen, a shuttle boat, have a chance, I will definitely return to use the service. Some sleeping nights dreamed of the joy of staying in this hotel."
"This stay was the first time to face the new year 2021's  fireworks. We stayed in Two bedrooms suites which facing to Icon Siam and also hotel's fireworks. Suite is very clean, they prepared alcohol hand gel and face masks. This hotel is very concerned with cleanliness during COVID-19. Breakfast was very superb. Big Thanks to Khun Chatchawan GM who well organised since recommended Suite, booked, allocated until checked out. We promised that we will be back to our Bangkok second home again."
Last friday I stayed with my friends and i feel that the hotel is a excellent hotel i ever stay in Bangkok with¬†a good services. Khun Varaporn and Khun Montana are a good staffs. They have a great service-minded! I am so happy to stay at Chatrium riverside hotel. I will back for sure!
"I was stay for my family trip. It‚Äôs really nice experience to stay here. Very large room and well maintenance. Food was great with a good taste. The view is amazing, either day or night. Definitely coming back soon. Thx to K.Anak to arrange this wonderful memory to our family‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"I highly recommend this hotel it has to be my most favorite in Bkk so far the rooms were large and clean, the bed comfortable and a great view of the river. The staff are absolutely amazing especially Khun Sudarat on the reception desk who escorted us to our room to make sure we were happy with the view of the river as we requested for my husband to do a time lapse and take photos and it was perfect. Even the staff in the restaurant were so attentive and apologized on one morning at breakfast due to being very busy so if you want an awesome hotel with the most helpful staff then this is the place to stay."
"The Lobby Lounge at Chatrium River Hotel Bangkok becomes one of my favourite place to hang and kill the time. I really like this place because it has a good ambiance and not too crowded as well.   One thing that I got fascinated by this place, they had the most affordable and best services from the two staffs at the Lobby Lounge who really touched my heart. Her names Miss Onchira Mahapuranon and Miss Kanokwan Daengsi. They are highly capable. They know what they‚Äôre doing and what they‚Äôre talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy is their main priority.   The service was very good, and the variety of pastries and coffee served in the ambiance was very satisfying and so relaxing.  Ms.Maneerat W. Nov 29th,2020 Customer"
"Service and staff over serviced with out the sincere and warmth to raise to the  highest comfort level. The exception was the service provided in the outdoor dining area which was excellent. The beds did not reach the same comfort level as some of the other 4 plus riverside hotels stayed at. The room stayed at had no reference to Covid-19 safety as other hotels in the area, but maybe just an oversite with housekeeping. Mixed view from excellent to could be better in the mentioned areas. Just misses from exceptional rating."
All staff at lobby lounge are very kind and helpful. This is my first time at this hotel and it is very impressive. I will come back next time. KHUN APHISARA AND KHUN ORN ESPECIALLY LOVELY. Ani I'll come back for internationl buffet.
"Very good service, friendly staff & house keeper did very good job in my room. Very clean & tidy. Specially thank you to K Anong. ü§ó make me have a wonderful & pleasant stay here. Recommended! Looking forward for the stay again."
"Very nice hotel, very nice view, very nice staff, very nice food & services and accommodation so big:) If you want to find a hotel close to river view i recommend this. Its once of you choice to make you happy."
"Hotel was beautIful, great service, great breakfast and very clean. All staff were well-trained. Special thank to Mr. Chatchawan for great services. We were reserved the room in high floor, 33rd so we could see the view of Chaopraya river very clear. Very nice and cozy atmosphere to relax. Great place with good price."
"It was really pleasant stay in the quiet, colorful place nearby the Chaophraya River. We have stay with kids which enjoyed the pool and sweets from the Bar. Thai food in the River Barge Restaurant was really tasty. Buffet Dinner was reach with variety of seafood. Staff was really helpful and friendly. We were happy there!"
The room is big and clean and has a fantastic view of the river. Staff were friendly. Afternoon tea session was impressive. Breakfast was good. Highly recommended for those who want to take a break and just rest.
There are very few hotels with balconies on the river at this price point with rooms this large. The rooms are generously appointed with full size refrigerator.  Bedding and furniture is very comfortable and the balconies for the suites offer a lot of space and comfort. The room  service menu is very large and the service is excellent. This by far is my favorite hotel in BKK.
Beautiful hotel and good view with Chaophaya river. Excellent service by K.Nat Concierge. Timsum buffet at Silver Wave is very delicious and many menu. Hotel location is located in town and near by many Departments store.
A hotel with beyond expectations Front staff name Amita and Wasin was extremely helpful. They know what I need and always serve it for. The room is huge then the price that you pay. Overall are 10/10.
"The room is very big and beautiful with nice interior design. Not only the room, but I got very excellent services from professional staff, everyone is so helpful. So I really enjoy staying this hotel."
"Chatrium Riverside was the first hotel that we made the decision to spend our vacation time after a relaxation of COVID-19 measures took place. We chose a Grand Suite Riverview that could sit in a balcony to savor the beautiful scenic Chao Phraya River in a panoramic view, take a deep breath, and enjoy the fresh air . The room is separated into 2 sections; bedroom and spacious living room. It also has a panty with a standard refrigerator size for home (not a hotel mini fridge size).  In overall, we are satisfied with the room facilities. However, we would like to suggest improving parking areas, it has unpleasant musty smell."
"Chatrium riverside, great hotel, lovely services.   Chatrium riverside hotel, great hotel, lovely services. Hotel by the Chaophraya River, In the heart of Bangkok, Thailand. Excellent services by full service mind staffs. Thai style hospitality that made me feel like home. Nice view of the Chaophraya river bank on both city view and urban view. Highly recommended for couple, for business. Easy access to BTS sky train. Only few minutes to get into Bangkok downtown. Recommend visitors to try Chinese timsum buffet at lunch.  Seafood dinner is also good for money as well. Overall 5 stars hotel and services. Good choice when you visit Bangkok, Thailand."
"This is one of the best in Bangkok by the Chaophraya river. Excellent services by well trained staffs. Nice facilities, very big room with very good amenities. Hotel is very near abs easy access to downtown. This is one of the best choice hotel by the Chaophraya river, Bangkok, Thailand."
"The M family found themselves in this delightful luxury hotel for a weekend break. Situated on the (rather grubby) Chao Praya river, the hotel is what you expect a 5 star hotel to be (though, perhaps, not quite so luxurious as the Oriental et al.). The 60m rooms and bathrooms (and kitchenette) are excellent and all fittings are top quality. The staff are helpful, respectful and the majority are ladies, all stunningly beautiful. The breakfast is very good, catering for all ethnicities.  My family pigged out on an English, then vindaloos, then salami salad, with capers and fresh walnuts.  Assorted Thai dishes were obviously available too.  Sided with this was an assortment of fresh bread, washed down with strong, freshly brewed coffee. The infinity pool on the 6th. floor is what"
The room is big and spacious. The kitchen in the room is handy. The river view over the balcony is marvelous. The swimming pool is large and beautiful. Breakfast is delicious. The service is excellent. All the staff are very friendly and helpful.
"Staffs were busy but still attentive. If you have to pay for the afternoon tea, then i would suggest you visit elsewhere, especially on weekend. Too crowded and noisy. The quality of bakery and sweet were less than expected. It made me feel like they throw whatever left over from BF and rebrand it as afternoon tea. Decent - macaron, cr√®me brulee, and scone (was quite dried and no butter smell), jam was good, the rest does not worth calories spent eating them."
"We had a wonderful stay. I would like to say a big thank you to Khun Chatchawan and his team and the Concierge team, Khun Mac, Khun Nat and Khun Tae who looked after us so well during our visit. We look forward to visiting the Chatrium again soon."
A peaceful of Chaophraya River can be viewed here. Nice Clean and Comfortable rooms and facilities here. Very service mind staffs with warm and advisable welcome.  We experienced Buffet Lunch Dim Sum at the River Barge Restaurant; beautiful ü§ü Should be a repeated experience here.
"I had a chance to stay with Chatrium for a night because I took my parents for a dinner cruise. However, the experience of hotel and staffs just terrific. I would like to say Thank you the most to Sophia and Tammy who work at front desk. They are really welcoming me and my old parents who are quite slow. Thank again of their brilliant service quality. Luckily, that we got a full breakfast service, chefs, staffs, foods are incredibly service. Room is clean and tidy.  Room 2807 ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Chatrium hotel is very nice . Kuakul ensured we had an awesome view and breakfast had a lot of information option .The pool is very big .l would stay here thanks to all houskeepping trem l come black again
"Convenience to go for sight -seeing both by the river, by road or even by BTS. The food is good in both Chinese Restaurant and the River Barge Restaurant Hospitality from all the staff, Salute to the Hotel Management Feel save from the way cleanliness and forrlow the golden rules from COVID-19"
The location and experience  are wonderful. The staff are outstanding and the service is always excellent. A special thanks must go to Miss Amita and Miss  Nopparat for sure we will return to this. nice Hotel
We had a great and wonderful time at the Chatrium Hotel.  Staff are all very nice and made us feel very welcome to be there.  The room was very clean with a comfortable bed and fantastic facilities.

We really appreciated the staff hospitality here. My car engine has failed and they gave their hand fully to fix and jump start my car. All the services here was superb. The room is spacious and homy. Certainly we will come back again.
Having a lunch with family at Silverware Restaurant and impressed by every dishesüòã.   Special thanks to Mr. Art for menu recommendations and followed up our order. The view of suite room is decent and worth the price!
"My mother and I are staying at the room with full river view, such speechless view to be honest. The room is well designed, organized and cleaned. We got a warm welcome from khun Chatchawan and khun Chalida both are super nice and made us feel like we‚Äôre home. Thank you so much for the best service ka."

"We have been staying here at the residence building for almost a year now and I would like to say that it has been such a wonderful time here. The place is very nice and clean and the people are lovely. Our house keeper Kun Anong, she has been helping us a lot. She is not just cleaning but also making sure that the room is comfortable for us. When we have to travel, she keep an eyes on things for us. She is really  nice and helpful. We have been so lucky. Other house keepers are very nice too. We are really appreciated the work they  have done.   I would very much recommend this hotel.  Wonderful place and people."
I‚Äôam staying at Chatrium Residence Riverside with my family. We were amazed to see such an active housekeeping staff like Khun Noi who take care our room very nice and clean Khun Noi she is very kind and friendly we very happy;) ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"Its been almost 5 years, my family and I stay at Chatrium Riverside Residence. We are really happy with our House Cleaner who clean our room 3 times every week. Her name is Khun Waraporn, she is really proffesional so our room really clean and comfort. She is also humble person who always play with my kids and kind person. Thank you, khun Waraporn and Chatrium."
I love Chatrium Hotel Riverside!  This is a very comfortable hotel and the staff are wonderful!  The room is always kept clean.  Housekeeping staff Ms. WARAPORN. She always smiles and works politely. I am really happy to stay at this hotel!
"A comfortable place with a very good view, namely the chao praya river. close to tourist spots and good food. the room service is also very nimble and clean. I was helped by Khun Anong. She is very skilled and nimble, clean and friendly. So don't hesitate to visit and stay here."
"First came to Bkk in 1994 and stayed in over so Hotels there over the years. Can honestly say the staff at the Chatrium are the best and so good can hardly be improved on.  Some things could be improved, the ceiling in the river barge cafe has been damaged and badly patched up, need a proper repair. Also the lights on the terrace in the evening are not enough, the cubes on the tables not bright enough. Over all a wonderful stay and the food is almost as good as the staff."
All the staff here are just brilliant and the rooms are spacious and very clean.  They took care of every enquiry and question with the utmost politeness and one of the front desk staff even went as far as lending me their personal laptop to use as the business centre PC's weren't available to me at the time.  Top tier customer service and a riverside restaurant - great!
"On this mother's day, though our house is in Bangkok. We decided to check in here for a relaxing holiday and pamper our mom.   We got a warm welcome once get off from the car, quite a distance frkm hotel entrance(not yet stepping in the hitel). A bell boy rushes to help with our stuff, without asking.  At the checkin counter, Khun Note (Front Office) has done an excellent quick check in. Clear information is given. He checked us in in a splendid skyview room with Chaophraya riverview. Offering late checkout,though in this low occupancy, we do really appreciate this.  So far a recommended hotel to stay, in a short holiday time."
"Awesome. That's the word I can only describe our experience in Chatrium. The food is great and the people are so friendly. My kids want to come back this December. I also love the bed, I would say this is my best sleep in a hotel so far."
"I had stayed for 1 night under name Thiti.  The staff at front desk especially Khun Monthana was attentive, always smile and welcome. Highly appreciated and I will be back to stay here again for sure. :D"
Varaporn from Chatrium Hotel is very nice! She showed us all the rooms and was very friendly.  Can't think of anything else to write so this is the space filler for minimum 200 character review for Varaporn.
"We stayed at the Chatrium Riverside Hotel and the Chatrium Riverside Residence for 7 months, including during the COVID pandemic. We felt very well cared for! The facilities are clean and well-maintained, the river view is breathtaking, the bamboo garden by the river feels like a sanctuary after a busy day in Bangkok. The location is great - short boat ride away from Saphan Taksin or a short tuktuk taxi ride away. The swimming pools are wonderful and the cakes and pastries in the lobby lounge sinfully good. Housekeeping staff are also professional. Highly recommend!"
"We Stayed In Deluxe Two-Bedroom Family Suite With River View, Water In Bathrooms And Pantry Smells Of Rust. They Should Have Bidet Faucet. Nice Breakfast. Hotel Is Very Clean And Located Front Of River. Highly Recommended For Family Stay."
"A lovely location to spend a weekend with friends. A very good French dinner by their new chef Jerome Bondaz and a spacious and comfortable suite with remarkable views of the river, it was the perfect staycation!"
"In December 2019 ( pre Covid-19 ) we made a non-refundable reservation for two rooms at this hotel for 6 nights in May 2020. Owing to the closed borders and no international flights, sadly our holiday did not happened.  This wonderful hotel was willing to hold on to our reservation with a six months extension. We had rescheduled our reservation for September 2020. At the moment, it is still not possible to visit and enjoy this lovely country in the near future. Business and private commitments make a holiday before the end of the year very, very challenging.  Again made contact with this hotel explaining our predicament. To our pleasant surprise they are willing to hold on to our reservation until May 2021. This is truly excellent customer care, service and understanding. We are"
"Hotel staff are very nice helpful hygiene and friendly with my kids  During the COVID situation they are very taking care well with the customers they always wear gloves and masks , there are alcohol gel spots around the hotel and the signs of social distancing... recommend to come and stay ...we definitely will come back and stay again"
"Really loved it from the moment we'd arrived because of the warmly welcome from your staffs, Khun Lalita, Khun Varaporn, and Khun Nontapat. I wish I could rate more than 5 stars. It's such an absolutely fantastic place with managed and maintained very well. The scenery from our balcony was extraordinary and the staffs were extremely helpful. I would love to get back to this hotel surely."
"The service is really superb! Every staff in this hotel shows a smiling face all the time, and they really do their best to provide an excellent service.  We encountered some problems in our room. We  just thought that it was due to covid, but they were kind enough to compensate it by upgrading our room to a 1 bedroom suite with one of the best views we had and even gave us an option to check out anytime we want. The food is also excellent. We thought that we will only have an a la carte breakfast for two days, but due to higher number of guests, they provided a buffet breakfast.Thank you so much, Chatrium Hotel Riverside. We highly recommend this hotel. We'd be glad to stay here again."
"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chatrium Riverside Hotel. Excellent and attentive staff. Very clean, well laid out facility with an excellent pool for families and lap swimming. We highly recommend the restaurant also. Excellent menu and affordable prices.  We also enjoyed that the location is close to Asiatique and Iconsiam. The BTS skytrain is close also for trips into the city.  We will definitely be returning here on our next trip to Bangkok."
This is my first time staying at Chatrium Riverside and I‚Äôm very impressed with how nice the staff members are and moreover the attached herewith view from my room. Surely I would highly recommend my colleagues and friends to stay here.
"The best ever with River and City. RIVER & CITY  And when you arrive, you will receive warm welcome from here host feel like you're come to friend house.  Wonderfully time at here! You will be another person loves the service of the staff here like me, when you're come to stay here!"
"It was a wonder place , nice view of chaopraya river  and nice location.  The room is clean and big enough for 2 people.   Hotel staff were very friendly and nice , they were very helpful of telling direction to go somewhere.  There was a boat service at the back of the hotel , it was free ."
I stay on 28th floor. Room was big but not clean as it should be. Dust and water came out a bit yellow when i first used. May be it because of the covid19. The unused of room and water. No bidet in the hotel (both in room and in lobby area) I find it very hard as i travel with kids who wearing diapers) The pool area was very quite. I did get into the pool and found it‚Äôs really slippery.   I had dim sum lunch which the food was very slow. The taste is average. I eat 3 meals in hotel. The variety of the food available is limited.
Really had a good time here at Chatrium Hotel Bangkok Riverside last week.I love the design of the room with riverside.It was really excellent and stunning! The staff at front desk who was very attentive and helpful.I requested for late check out at 1 pm. So kind Khun Lertchai.Thank you ! The poolside was perfect and beautiful. I will recommend this hotel to my friend ka!
"good opportunity to stay with nice hotel location and friendly staff '' Khun Lertchai '' He has a nice service that I never met , So thank you for your kindly service.  For our room also clean and nice view with reasonable price."
"Just visit there a week ago, hanging out on my vacation. Feel so good with the best view of the riverside in Bangkok. The staff were friendly and helpful. Was support by Khun Lertchai as well, finally love the food and service there. Super recommended!!"
"Chatrium Hotel Riverside Bangkok is located on the most beautiful point of Chaopraya river . The rooms are huge and comfortable . The hotel staffs are helpful and very kind ! I would like to special thank you to Mr.Wasin at the reception desk , he allowed me to check in very early with the fantastic river view room . And he also advised me to reserve the breakfast on the next morning with discount rate ! The breakfast have variety food and delicious ! I wish to be back again soon !"
An amazing weekend stay with friends! The staff were super friendly and helpful and they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. We‚Äôve even booked our suite again for next weekend! Thank you Chatrium!
Excellent stay with fantastic service and wonderful food. Delicious breakfast. The staff are very friendly amd helpful. We were given a late check out and allowed to check-in early as we arrived sooner than expected. A very good deal and have booked to come back the following weekend. Highly recommend.
"Was a very happy rest Good service, very good service since getting out of the car Until the day of departure Everything is perfect Especially the service of Ms Sudarat, the front desk is very good, most impressive. Will definitely visit again."
This is one of a good riverside hotels in Bangkok.  Its location is charming with a nice curve of Chaophaya river view.  Room is spacious in Condominium style with small kitchen and nice river view.  While food variety is great the taste is a bit disappointing.
"We have been coming here every year to celebrate our wedding anniversary. This is our fourth year. Chatrium has never let us down!!! The service is excellent. The room is spotless. And the view from our bedroom is breathtaking. Special thanks to K.Sudarat; our receptionist who took extra attention to all our requests, and K. Kuakul and K.Piyanut for creating a lovely swans on our bed. The hospitality here is the best, with no near second."
We spend our long holiday here.Staffs are  very professional and helpful.Thanks Khun Varaporn at front desk.She is very nice and treats me with her warm welcome and also Thanks Khun Lertchai for providing such a good room for me.you can say it's a huge room with fabulous view.There are big balcony facing to river and kitchen for cooking.The swimming pool has enough space for us to swim.Food is very good and yummy kaaaa ^^
We have a great time during our short stay at Chatrium Hotel Riverside Bangkok. Helpful front office staff especially Khun Note front office manager. We stayed at room 2912 this time and we have a great time during this stay and we will come back to this hotel again for sure.
"This was my second stay during the COVID lock down. It was just a week apart but the atmosphere has shifted from quiet place to more lively due to their room promotion. Nicely done! Also, big thanks to hotel manager whom accommodated my request in every possible way he could.    The 2BR suites overlook the river was stunning. View from the balcony at sunset and nighttime can really take your breath away and we spent a lot of time taking pictures there.   Love the location and how convenient it is to go anywhere.  Room was nice, almost fully equipped, but you can always ask the customer service if there is anything missing. In my case was toothbrush, but i didn't mind. All staffs are friendly and supportive. The reception remember my name and room number from my last stay."
"A home away from home with the service rendered from the hearts of all the employees here. You will never felt nobody in this hotel due to the concern of the people working in this hotel. If you want to make your vacation a joyful and hard to forget, come and stay at Chatrium Riverside hotel. You will certainly feel at home."
"A true 5* experience. The effort the staff go to to make you feel welcome is amazing, without being over bearing. Excellent English so no miscommunication. The welcome at check in, efficiency of check-in and check-out, room service and restaurant and the room itself were all brilliant. Unfortunately we stayed during the Bangkok lockdown so couldn't use the pool or gym."
We really loved this place! The room was big and lovely! The location was perfect and our room had a great view of the river!  We took the shuttle boat one day and used Grab rides to get everywhere else. Easy access to everything and in a nice calm spot.  The breakfast and dinner buffets were fantastic. Pay for the included breakfast when you reserve - it‚Äôs well worth it!
