"This place was such a gem to find! The staff were so kind and accommodating, and upgraded our room to one with a little outside space to sit. This was lovely, as we could work outside, but still in private! The bed was really comfortable, and we slept solidly. We had breakfast included, and when we arrived they mentioned that it was mainly meaty... but when we stated that one of us does not eat meat, they really went above and beyond! We had enough food to feed a whole family, and it was delicious! Fresh fruits, coffee, and juices, followed by stews, sweet fried dough balls (with condensed milk - these were WOW!). The whole experience was great. There is a 7-eleven and plenty of street vendors just down the road for food and snacks. We only stayed one night, but would definitely"
"We booked in here for 2 nights over a weekend to get away from work. We booked the Tawet Suite with the jacuzzi outside. It’s amazing how it’s so peaceful and yet in the centre of the city.   The staff - were excellent, professional and very helpful. Nothing was to much trouble.   The room - was lovely, the jacuzzi was a real treat, decor was nice and the bathroom was fab.  Cleanliness - the whole hotel was spotless, the room was immaculate and the communal areas and dining room were very clean.   COVID measures - masks are worn and there is space to social distance. Temperature taken on arrival, QR tracker and hand sanitiser available.   Food - we pre ordered a dinner for 2 set menu and the food was amazing, healthy and fresh and a lovely variety. Breakfast was also very nice"
"Right off the road you would never expect to find a place like this.  Its like this place is in its own little world.  The staff are super friendly and helpful and will change you $$ into Baht.  The pool is a great place to hang out and the breakfast was always great.  Room was nice and comfy and room service was always courteous.  Its walking distance to the boats to take to o see the temples.  The night life is a tad different, but street food vendors are everywhere with cheap amazing food, bought lunch for 2$.  This hotel is great I would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone."
"We only had 1 night here, but it was an excellent stay. Receptionist very kind and polite. Our room is Mattana suite our room was huge and well-appointed, and the comfortable bed and quiet room made for night’s sleep. Garden View from my room was very wonderful. I’d certainly stay here again if I was ever in Bangkok 💙"
"Round the corner from the busy Bangkok life is this quiet and tranquil hotel. It’s as though you’re no longer in Bangkok! Fantastic hospitality, it smells great, rooms are perfect and the breakfast has variety. A must for escaping Bangkok whilst you’re touring the city!"
Wonderful piece of paradise in the middle of Bangkok. Express boat on cha praya easily reachable (10min walk). We enjoyed the pool and the very well maintained garden. Breakfast can be enjoyed in the garden also.
"Good: We had a beautiful suite with a private garden and a jacuzzi and a sofa in the garden. The name is suite Taywet. The room and bathroom are beautiful, very spacious with a very stylish design. Everything was very clean. The bathroom has both bath and shower. The minibar has a few complementary drinks and snacks. The WIFI is perfect. The air conditioning is strong. The staff is friendly, helpful and they speak a perfect english. Could be improved: the restaurant is beautiful but the breakfast food was basic and of average quality (dry pastries, very salty rice, but the dragon fruit was delicious). I was expecting more from such a good hotel. We did not try dinner nor room service so I cannot comment. They have taxis to the airport for 500 bhats (it takes 40-60 mins depending"
"The rooms look really nice, pool and outdoor area are amazing. The breakfast is awesome, there’s a buffet and you also get a menu to chose eggs and sides from. They will make eggs for you fresh. Wifi is really fast. Staff is super nice. We had an issue with our room as there was mould on the wall under the aircon, but we got a new room straight away, which was even bigger.  Amazing hotel."
The grounds for this hotel are beautiful with a nice garden and small pool area. The food is excellent in the dining room and the front desk staff are very kind and helpful. However this is one of the noisiest hotels I have ever stayed in. We were above the dining room we could hear the hustle and bustle of the kitchen and dining room. And the walls are so thin you can hear the people next to you sneeze and when they move around their room your room shakes. There is also the loud noise from within and outside the grounds such as machines and motorcycles. Because it is a hotel there are inevitably people leaving for the airport at all hours of the night. We were woken up at 4 am one night and 1 am the other. You can hear everything in your room. While it is a beautiful hotel I
"We stayed here 3 times over the course of  2 week holiday. The staff were really friendly, very helpful. The welcome drink is a really nice touch. The pool is small but a nice place to relax. Breakfast is quite a small selection but tasty. All the rooms we stayed in were comfy, clean, beds are comfy. The hotel doesn’t feel like it’s in the centre of Bangkok. There are some nice restaurants within walking distance. We really enjoyed our stays here!!"
"It was my 3rd stay in Bangkok - this accommodation was definitely the best one.  Great location - very close to heart of nightlife, but far from all its noise. Staff was very friendly, always ready to help and answer all our questions.  I recieved detailed information how to get to hotel with estimated prices of transportation few days prior our arrival.  Not a single reason, to search for other hotel (if I will come again)"
"We stayed there 4 nights, 3 days they had events and wedding so couldn’t use the swimming pool as all the people from the wedding and seminars using the poolside area.   Imagine you would like to go for a swim but there are 50 people next to the poolside running around  and taking wedding photos.    Our room was next to the busy road and no lifts.   I guess only rooms around the garden and pool areas are noise free but if they do not have any events.   I really like this hotel in general however if they only have prioritised hotel guests rather than seminars and wedding receptions.   They have the potential but we won’t book again.   This meant to be a wellness, boutique hotel not a venue.   Staffs are very friendly and helpful, that’s the best thing."
I spent 2 weeks for traveling in Thailand with my wife. I looking for nice hotel in Bangkok and I found this hotel on TripAdvisor many people recommended this hotel and I booked here. When I come I feel most impressed for the service from front desk. He’s polite and smart. Roselle juice is amazing! For the welcome drink I never drunk before. Fantastic!!! Room’s very nice  unique  and  quiet but no view. The breakfast was good with tasty Thai style!  Hotel nearest main historical attractions and easy to go by boat about 20 mins.    Definitely if I come back to Bangkok I’ll stay here again!
"Worst hotel experience ever! Any 3* hotel in Bangkok will probably be better. Our tiny room did not have any window. This was not indicated in the room description. Whenever warm water was used in this part of the building, there was an annoying beep for 30 seconds. The staff was rather cold and not warm-hearted (unlike any other place we stayed in Thailand and SEA). The room and bathroom are dated and need refurbishment. We voiked a hotel pick-up to the airport ehich was 20 minutes late. We had to carry out suit cases th ough the parking lot and put them in tje trunk on our own - the driver and hitel staff were just watching. I cannot recommend this hotel at all!"
"Raweekanlaya is located away from the hip and happening parts of Bangkok, but the ambience is beautiful with heritage structures, old trees, chirping birds and cobbled pathways. One can spend time sitting under the banyan tree, watching the cool pool and hearing the birds, if one can ignore the mosquito bites which come as a bonus 😃 ! The reception is in an old building, so also the dining hall. There are a few heritage guest rooms too. But now they have constructed a new structure which houses most of the rooms. This new building is pretty and well done up , though the old world charm is missing. I got an Executive room facing the street which is a bit noisy and has lights coming into the room till late at night . There is no cupboard in the room which is ok as there are"
"We stayed here while visiting Bangkok for a few days before heading south to the island of Koh Tao.  The hotel is an oasis of calm in a city of absolute chaos. Bangkok is mad, there's something happening all the time, so when you come back from a day of sightseeing, the hotel gives you a very nice break. We stayed in their honeymoon suite, so we had a private garden and pool tub.  Everything is very clean, and the gardens are kept very nice. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful.  It was a great start to our honeymoon, if I was in Bangkok again I would go back to stay here."
"I like the pool, the generous breakfast and friendly staff. The hotel is small and I booked the smallest room, but coming from Japan, it's very cozy. Free drinks in the mini bar and fresh fruits. Helpful staff to hail the cab for you. Easy to get to Bangkok's palaces and the temples in the are."
"The garden and swimming pool are lovely, a little sun trap nearly all day. Unfortunately that’s where it ends.. the decor is gorgeous I found myself in love with numerous things dotted around!  However, you will find holes in your bedding, and a broken TV. You will not be in a serene bedroom opening your white shutters to look over the pool and relaxed gardens, you will be next to a main busy road which is noisy ALL hours. We paid for a deluxe room, and it appears these are all along this corridor, not a peaceful night sleep. That’s alongside the noisy floors outside your room that people seem to be walking up and down all hours..  unfortunately the hotel looks the part, but It’s falling apart at the seams.. literally."
"We stayed at this hotel for 5 days and the service was just impeccable. The spaces are clean, staff is so warm.  We loved the food served at the dinning, above all please try their papaya salad! I would definitely return."
"I spent 10 days traveling Thailand with a travel group and from the islands I took a late flight into Bangkok for one last night. I am so glad I picked this resort. I arrived close to midnight and was greeted by a sweet lady with tea. I was exhausted and I think she could tell. She was excited to tell me that she was able to upgrade my room! The room was clean and had a peaceful vibe to it. I was even more delighted in the morning. The resort was so beautiful. I had a great breakfast at the cafe next door after making a spa appointment for later that day. I had the most amazing 2-hour massage. The spa staff was so sweet and I enjoyed speaking with them. If I ever make it back to Thailand, I will definitely be staying here again!"
"The staff are excellent and are very friendly and helpful full. Even though the hotel is small, it is perfectly formed and feels like an oasis in Bangkok. The breakfast had a small amount of choice but the highlight had to be the restaurant in the evening. The food was authentic and with a great choice of dishes and was reasonable priced as well. Our room as one of the smaller options and was slightly tired but still clean and tidy."
Good staff and good location.Thai food is very well.The hotel is beautiful it look like thai house the room is good it comfortable for my parents.Not far away from the river to go to another place in bangkok
"I arrived at Raweekanlaya rather late in the evening due to my flight, but was happily surprised when a very polite young woman greeted me and the front door. Everything about this hotel is excellent, from the service to the accommodations. My stay was so great I rebooked the following evening.  My initial room was on the second floor. It was a small room, but the bed was very comfortable. I was surprised to find there were no windows in this room, however, it did not bother me. I found the peace and darkness helpful the following morning as I adjusted to the time changes.  The second room was on the third floor complete with windows! Again, very comfortable.  The pool area is beautiful. The food is great. And the staff exceed expectations."
"The hotel is so homey feel and there are a lot of garden area, colonial style house and the room is look like home style which is very hard to find in Bangkok in the present time.  Recommend to try and experience this hotel"
Me and my boyfriend booked a Mattana deluxe type room for one night but it’s turned out like we got a downgrade room!! They said the room that we booked got a problem with electricity but i think its a lier. The manager apologized to us when we checked in and asked us to stay in another room instead and offer a dinner set for usand late checkout. I think it’s unfair for us and made me feel like because we are thai so they can do whatever to us. Then I asked for cancellation they said its gonna took 30-45 days to refund us. The manager even said i choose accept the offer cus its the best way and they room that we choose he said is not the good spot also omgg!!  In the end we asked them to refund the difference they said they can’t do that. Finally we didn’t have a choice we have
This hotel is renovated from the house was built for more than one hundread years.So the trees are very big.You will feel like you find an oasis in the desert.Near the hotel there are a lot of yummy street foods and old style restaurants.Do not miss.
"It's a nice upper scale colonial hotel not too far from Bangkok old town attractions (about 4 km. from The Grand Palace). The hotel has nice, cozy style rooms with green/lush surrounding. So if you are looking for a place that is more cozy and upper class than Khao San road but still has some old nostagic feelings in general, I would recommending this place. The hotel also position itself as ""wellness cuisine resort"" (it's on the front hotel signboard). So you can enjoy Thai cuisine while be pampered here as well."
"We didn’t stay here but we booked the spa and dinner. The spa experience was truly amazing! We booked the Summer Bliss promotion and it was worth every penny. My therapist was K Chutikan (I’m not entirely sure) but she did wonders with that massage! Dinner afterwards was okay. It’s a wellness restaurant, so they don’t serve alcohol. I would definitely go back to experience the spa again!"
"This hotel is s little small gem in the middle of busy Bangkok, beautiful garden and cozy atmosphere. However, the service was really extremely bad. All the staff speak very little English and it's very hard to communicate. Our room was extremely small and the bathroom was disgustingly dirty. When we checked in, the toilet was full of bowel from the guest before us. We called room service, they cleaned it, but nobody apologized. In a hotel of this kind, this is totally unacceptable. The second day our bathroom was barely cleaned, the trash bins were not emptied, the glasses were not washed. We had dinner there the first night and it was one of the worst dining experience we ever had, very inexpensive, that's true but also very bad. Breakfast was ok instead. It's. a real shame,"
"Could not fault this hotel, perfectly clean. Gorgeous room, great range of free toiletries. Booked a massage for us both which was great! Pool was lovely! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Bangkok but escape the chaos."
"The moment you step in the lobby, it smells so good you feel like you are not in Bangkok anymore! The vegetation is luxurious, it feels like you are in the middle of the jungle. Also the staff is friendly and the rooms are very clean. Having chosen the executive room facing the canal, we were afraid at first that we would not be able to sleep with the traffic sounds coming up from the street, but it gets quiet at night so this ended up not being a problem at all. We would definitely recommend this hotel and come back."
"We stayed here for 5 days on our honeymoon whilst visiting the sights in Bangkok before moving into the a more relaxing location in Thailand. We only wanted a simple hotel stay as we knew we wouldn't be in the room much at all. This hotel was clean with pretty grounds and the staff were friendly. Although we didn't use it, the pool area was tranquil. I really recommend staying here if you plan to see the temples as it is central to all the main ones, we walked everywhere and this location was perfect for this.   One negative point was one day after cleaning most of our snacks and drinks were removed from the mini bar without being told. We thought the cleaners had done this as a tactic to charge us at the end but as soon as it happened my partner knew and said something. It took"
Good Lunch with green ambience of resort inside Bangkok old town. Thai food & dessert here are nice for Thais & foreigners. Impressive ambience with service but spa is not recommended.   Spa ambience was good but there was air con smell in foot massage room. I tried to ask therapist to massage softly but she may not get used to so she did not follow my instruction. The spa treatment was not soft as same as you could expect from this type of resort.
"This hotel was really nice!  It was like a little oasis in the middle of this big city and worth the money. The staff was really kind and helpful, wifi working with no interruption and overall it was a great stay. We liked the breakfast buffet a lot and the pool area was also nice. We had a very late flight back home and could leave all baggage there and shower in the evening. The location is quite good."
"Very good service, and nice rooms. Boutique hotel which will not give you the uniform standard of the big hotel chains, but a much more personal experience. Reasonable location in the city, slightly off the old backpackers districts."
"I would try to describe as much as possible in details. The first impression is amazing as the ladies as the receptions are incredibile gentle and skilled to welcome the guests. Then the first thing I didn’t like is that the room is not in the same building inside the garden but in the amenity building. But the worst thing is that the room is facing an absolutely noisy street also during the night with tuk tuk, cars and buses going up and down without any kind of sound proof. Another point they do not have any kind of wardrobe so be careful if u think to stay more than 2 night you will have problems as the room is also quite small so you will not have any space to walk and store your clothes! Worst impact sorry to say the cleanliness hairs in the bath room and also the shower"
"We recently spent two nights of our three week trip to Thailand at the Raweekanlaya Bangkok. We were greeted very early in the morning after our flight landed from Australia by warm smiles and efficient service and our bags were taken to our room quickly and professionally.  Being on a much needed Christmas vacation we had looked forward to settling by the pool with a cold beer after our long flight but much to our surprise and dismay we found that the hotel does not have a bar or indeed serve alcohol of any kind (although it can be brought in from outside). I feel that this is a fact a lot of holiday makers would be keen to know about as its not clear anywhere from our booking that this hotel is in fact more of a health retreat....Anyway, we made do, but still....  The hotel"
A lovely heritage boutique hotel nestled away in downtown BKK.   It was a surprise to have a boutique resort experience while being still in the city.   You get the peace and quiet of the lovely garden and pool but still access to the sights and delights of Bangkok.   The location is a 20 min or so walk to Khao San Rd backpackers area and a 20 min cab ride from downtown Siam shopping district.  But the extra time on logistics getting around town was worth it.   The rooms have plenty of charm and that heritage feel in the design.  The restaurant was good quality very fairly priced.   Breakfast options were limited for a 5 star hotel.
"Just spent 2 days at Raweekanlaya Bangkok and was pleasantly surprised.   Staff at reception are very friendly and service minded. Prior to my arrival the email communication was very timely. I upgraded to the Mattana Deluxe as I wanted a quiet room and happy that I did. The room was peaceful, spotless clean, nice size for solo traveler and bed was comfy.  The only negative comment I have is that the restaurant service was very slow. Food on a positive note didn’t disappoint."
"Not sure the criterias to consider this hotel 5 stars in booking.com. Looks a nice hotel in pictures but completely different when you get there, staff friendly though. Tiny room without window, very small pool and very limited breakfast."
This place looks amazing on the booking website but I was a little disappointed. The room was tiny and had no window but nicely decorated. We should have been warned about the lack of window. The walls were so thin my mum 4 doors down could hear my baby crying (oops). Pool is nice but completely shaded by trees which is probably great for most but not me as I like sunbathing! Ended up sitting in the car park to get some sun! Take your mosquito lotion as there are lots of insects (obviously not the fault of the hotel but just because of the gardens). Lovely old colonial building with very tasteful decor and lovely gardens/communal areas. WiFi terrible.  Staff lovely and welcoming. Late check out cost half the room rate which I thought was a bit of a rip off. Location is a bit
"I live in Bangkok but it was my friend's Birthday and we wanted to do something different so we booked this hotel for 2 nights. I arrived at 2pm. My room was not ready. So the hotel offered me a 30 mins complimentary foot massage while waiting for the room to be done. It was really nice massage. My Masseuse lady (i think her name is Khun Wannee) knows what she's doing. By massaging my legs she can tell that I have a back problem!! She is best!!  My room has no window. I felt like i could not breath when in the room. I can hear people talking , coughing , walking from next door or outside my room. That was a big downside I must say.   The hotel garden is amazing.  The pool is tiny. The staff are very nice and helpful. Breakfast and afternoon tea were good."
"Bangkok is nuts. Hot, impenetrable, chaotic. But the Raweekanlaya is a welcoming oasis in the city center. Situated in a pleasant neighborhood a couple blocks up from the Chao Phraya River, it's a convenient staging site for exploring the city. The guest rooms are clean and comfortable, and the garden-like courtyard is dominated by a large banyan tree. Lots of colonial charm. And the service is tip-top. One complaint: the small pool with limited seating. You want a pool in the heat of Bangkok."
"We stayed over 5 nights as our base in Bangkok. So if Asia becomes too much the garden and facilities can be a safe heaven to just chill and spend quality time.  Reception staff is quite helpful and you get impressed with the garden/pool initially when you enter. But the moment you sit to relax  in garden and order a drink you cannot find a single staff.. I have also seen people complaining in breakfast from same staffing issues.. next you find a person and find out hotel has no alcohol license! In Thailand!  On top of this they closed the garden for hours for a private event, where guests are paying to use the facilities! I am sorry but you cannot simply close common area where you promote your hotel to make money on the side.. That felt we were cheated..  Next on the rooms, we"
"This is definitely the best one in Bangkok. The Raweekanlaya is just like a palace and it’s near Khao San Rd., the good spot to go. The location is good. You can go anywhere by taxi and it’s cheap. There’s some local food near the hotel. People can get some food there. The service is also good. I also got lots of advices from Joobjib, who works at Raweekanlaya. She recommended me go to many amazing spots. She is nice and beautiful. I’ll stay at this place if I go to Bangkok next time. Hope to see her soon❤️"
"Hotel heritage style and all decorations were fascinating. Though the hotel was small, I can sit down and relax by the garden. A room was clean and neat, while food was good. The restaurant, however, no alcohol drink and slow service. Also, fairly bad traffic around the hotel."
"the view was very nice, the accommodation and decoration was beautiful as well. staff was polite and great service mind. the room was a bit noisy as it was near the street but we still have a pleasant stay at the resort."
"I have stayed in The Raweekanlaya resort only one nice with my team colleague, we have a very nice stay here and the resort decoration is perfect. The location quite in the old city, small swimming pool, so-so breakfast, beautiful style, view of the river was very nice, Staff was very nice, The price quite high when compare with others."
"It was excellent silent place where can stay till how long it is, the staff is so helpful specially at night and the way we get warm welcomed from receptionist its really impressed and for sure will stay here again very good environment.  I really appreciate the help from front manager black suite I would like to thank you him for helping my friends with his professional skills of service with brilliant english."
"Found this hotel on trip advisor , what a stroke of luck !!! It's a really beautiful  hotel from the wonderful greeting at the reception  where the staff are so gentle  to the beautiful grounds and wonderful building . Only stayed overnight  but we are going  back to Bangkok just to stay longer in this can't call it a hotel  more like a a home from home . Ok they don't serve alcohol  but that's no big deal  and an added bonus they are on the tuk tuk hop  route  which I really recommend  to look up  Tuktukhop.com"
"I stayed in a Mattanee Superior room which was spacious and a really pretty room (room 1307).  The room and service were lovely and the garden and pool area are a beautiful oasis from the hustle and bustle of Bangkok.  I had a lovely lunch out in the garden on my first day and highly recommend the food. I was a bit disappointed when I wanted to repeat that experience and was told they could not serve me in the garden. I’m not sure why it was ok one day, and not doable two days later.   If you can do Iunch in the garden - do it. It’s a gorgeous meal in a gorgeous garden. Probably the best Thai meal I’ve ever had!  While my room was lovely, it was on the third floor and there is no lift. Personally I was fine with that, but the stairs could be a problem or others. Also my room was"
"We stayed here for three nights before our flight to Singapore,  and it was absolutely fantastic. Service was exceptional, room was great, and the bed was fantastic! Definitely stay again when we come back to Bangkok!"
We stayed for an overnight stop before travelling onwards. We were driving in the centre of Bangkok  and the hotel was a gem in a fairly run down area. The Superior room was great and just a 15 minute walk from Koh San Road and a fun night out. A great stopover location. Wanted a beer but the hotel is dry but not an issue. Will use again
"Stayed here for one night before flying back to UK. Lovely welcome from the staff who can't do enough for you. The grounds are beautiful and well kept, even in the quiet season. We were upgraded to a pool view which was a nice touch!"
"My friend and I stayed at the Raweekanlaya on our recent trip to Bangkok. We arrived at almost 01:00 AM and were immediately greeted by Palm and Bye, who both checked us in quickly and efficiently. They were so sweet! We had a special tea waiting for us when we arrived to help with jet lag and relaxation. After our check in, Palm carried our bags over to our room.   Our room was quite spacious for a small boutique hotel, and there was a plate of fresh fruit and water bottles waiting for us. Our room overlooked the street, but it was very quiet considering there were many street vendors still bustling about on the road. We were pretty hungry, so after we dropped off our bags we ate at a small pho vendor - delicious!   The next morning we explored the hotel. The grounds are full"
"This was my first time in Bangkok and I can honestly say this resort was a good introduction to Thailand in terms of the scenery( lovely trees and flowers within the compound), it people and the food. The employees were BEYOND helpful and nice, More importantly, they took the time to write(in Thai) the addresses of all the locations my mum and I visited. This was super helpful to move around( I always had a sticky note with an address written in Thai). The breakfast menu was wonderful and healthy, I loved every moment of my experience here. My room was cleaned with a change of towels every day. However the room was a bit smaller than expected(the Mattanee Superior). When  I needed a taxi, I could casually walk into the reception.  There is a street market just 10 mins away from"
"Our first impression of the hotel was the decorations in Thai colonial style and the warm welcome from the staffs that made us feel special yet cozy and private while the location is close to the main tourist attractions in Bangkok center. The staffs were very polite and friendly. The room was comfortable, enough space to fit a king size bed (very good bedding materials) and a few pretty furniture pieces, not spacy. The ready-to-brew coffee they provided at the minibar was well selected. Loved their shower gel and body lotion, rich in aroma but felt so relaxing and charming after use. The breakfast was good with choices of pastries and their a la carte gourmet dinner was amazingly tasty! The jacuzzi pool was more for relaxing not for swimming."
"I booked the hotel because the pictures were looking really good online. The welcoming was friendly and polite. The pool is very small but the garden and the space is very elegant. The room was tiny, not even space to open a suitcase. It was extremely hot inside.  The toilet was really very basic. The building does not have elevator so don’t come here on a wheelchair or with a big case. The views were to an ugly ceiling of a house (see picture) The room was extremely noisy. All night long noises from rooms around and staff. Its actually very hard to sleep. For the price, i strongly dis recommend this hotel. There many affordable options in Bangkok that are way better than this one."
"The hotel was of a reasonable standard - generally clean, and as others have said, the lavender fragrance throughout is a nice touch. We opted for the small room, which was of decent size, though was lacking features such as a desk to sit at or any real space to store luggage. The hotel is not ideally situated. Buses and the pier are nearby, but train stations are not, so you must contend with unpredictable taxis and tuk-tuks to reach some destinations. The exercise room is adequate, but we found the pool area to be a little disappointing; trees overhang the loungers, and have stained them with various droppings. We didn't particularly want to use them. Food is ok, if a little pricey. Take care when ordering as we were confused when our appetisers and main meals were served"
"We visited Bangkok for the first time early June 2018. This place was our first experience and the face of Bangkok. It is not your average hotel, it is a mini boutique hotel. The staff greeted us at the door upon our arrival with a traditional drink and a mini Thai message. The room is a little small, however, the place is very calming and the smell of jasmine seeps through into the rooms. Tum from the restaurant introduced us to the Thai cuisine and helped us select our dinner order.  We did take advantage of the Thai Message available onsite for an extra $500 - $1000 bht depending on the length and service of the message. With that being said, The Raweekanlaya is a little far from the downtown hustle and about an hour and a half away from the airport. Most taxi drivers didn't"
The hotel is clean and a green oasis away from the city. It was a bit far out for anyone looking to go into the city and no good restaurants near by. Pool was great but the loungers could be better. Overall ok
"I live in Bangkok, in Sathorn area, which super busy all the time. It's actually only 30 mins from my home but when you inside the hotel. You will feel like  you are at another province. Quiet and peaceful, reading book and relax at the pool all day with a big tree at the middle at the hotel.  The room is beautiful with the decoration and everything. The lobby smell so good, even better in spa. Speaking of SPA, guys, you need to try a THAI massage there. It's feel so relax. Every stiff that I have is gone.  Such a great place to recommend to hear you thought and your heart"
My first solo trip was to Bangkok and this hotel captured the essence of what I was looking for. The staff was impeccably kind. The room felt like my home away from home. The surroundings and the environment was more than what I could dream of. This was the perfect hotel to start my solo journey.... I ended up meeting my soulmate at this hotel! This is where it all began! I can’t wait to plan my wedding there!  Thank you for a wonderful stay!! ❣️
"This place is near old town historic area and not far from destination to visit.There is only 38 rooms( not too much, not too little). There are many type of trees. The special thing for me is they have a set of authentic Thai meal."
"2 nights here, mixed bag. The hotel is beautiful and staff very friendly in the best of Thai tradition but little things let the place down, 1 no alcohol, apparently they do not have a license due to their proximity to a school (according to staff); 2 the showers in the rooms are very poor, low pressure and dont maintain heat and 3 the breakfast which was very average I requested soft poached eggs on toast and received 2 very overcooked eggs on soggy bread!   The thai food from the restaurant (for which the hotel is famous) justified the reputation but western dishes such as the pasta carbonara were bland and tasteless.   Really this place is so close to being truly great if it could fix those issues."
"I was so excited to visit Bangkok and Raweekanlaya was the best hotel for us.. very attentive staff and the facilities were very clean, comfortable and gorgeous. The poolside is small but gorgeous. I will definitely go back to Raweekanlaya."
This hotel was AMAZING. Their service was 5 star and the scenery is to die for. The room was more than what I expected. Comfy and made me feel important. Would definitely come back again and tell my friends and family.
"Raweekanlaya is a perfect hotel for all visitors who wish to relax in a calm, lovely and elegant atmosphere. The hotel is now my go-to place to sneak out of all the hustle and bustle.   I’m a Bangkokian myself, but decided to book this hotel to get away from all the chaos in downtown and let myself (and my brain) rest for a bit. I packed some books to read, pens and a notebook, 2-night clothes and that’s all.    The location of this hotel is very convenient. The famous Khaosan Street is within a walking distance. All the staff are extremely friendly and accommodating. They also have gym, spa, and pool. I was too lazy to move though.   Everything in the room is spotless and the bed is so comfortable.  The decoration looks minimal at first glance, but soon you’ll start to see full"
"We always dream of coming back to Bangkok and it finally happened after 6 years of our first visit to Thailand. This hotel has everything to do to make our second trip memorable and very pleasant and we love Thailand even more. We are greeted and served very well by the staff, the rooms are very nice, love the design. Hope to return again to Thailand one day and definitely will stay here again."
"Me and my lover had such a romantic time at this location. The facilities and staff were heavenly and the area is safe, fun, and beautiful. I highly suggest for any getaways with a special someone or family"
"We had a great experience at this hotel on our first trip to Thailand. The staff was friendly and helpful – always willing to help. The room was spacious and clean. We plan to head back soon, and will definitely be staying here again!"
"The Raweekenlaya is a good place for family or group of friends who wish to have peaceful staying in Bangkok. The room is clean and the staffs are friendly! You will see the Thainess in every thing at the hotel, from the way of decoration, bed, chair, tables, bamboo containers dining room... You could hear the sound of insects, frogs from garden, ponds at night... it's quite interesting like you are in the tropical countryside. The location of the hotel is convenient. You could walk to famous Khaosan Street and visit Grand Place, Wat Phrakeo nearby."
"An oasis to retreat to after a long day wandering in Bangkok. You can hear water flowing, birds singing, and smell floral aromas as you walk through the grounds. The service is impeccable. They will hail a taxi for you, so you can trust you won’t get scammed by the cab. The room was comfortable, though somewhat small. The bed was firm, comfortable and clean. Hot water aplenty. You can spend an entire day here relaxing if you wish. They have a spa, gym, fine-dining, pool, and little sitting areas around the property. This is definitely a place more suitable for adults/couples rather than children."
"I’ve stayed here for work twice while at the UN. It’s been a fantastic place. Really pretty, great service, nice food. It also has a nice spa attached to the hotel. I’d recommend it to those visiting for a holiday too. Pool is nice and the ambiance is very spa like."
"lovely, beauty and very healthy place. friendly staff especially housekeeper. wellcome drink was lovely sweet, restaurant with nice food, swimming pool quite small but fine.  reasonable to stay. i’ll come back very soon."
"The hotel is placed relatively close to the main attractions of the Grand Palace, Wat Pho, and lots of temples. Be aware of the following:  1. The area is a bit dodgy and scammers are running their scams in almost every corner of the surrounding streets 2. Cleanliness - there is dust in the rooms that can affect people with allergies  3. Montha Rooms do not have windows (at least the one that we were in). In the photos they have shutters/blinds but they are leading to a wall. This makes the place a bit dark  4. Swimming pool is small 5. Breakfast was good but mainly had eggs and bacon and sausage for the 'warm' dish 6. There is noise during morning hours and sometimes the cleaners are noisy as well 7. If you have the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door, they will still knock your"
We stayed here on the last two nights of our honeymoon in Thailand. The hotel was so relaxing and nearby to Khaosan Road. The rooms are lovely and the grounds and swimming pool make you feel like you are not in the Center of a city. There is also a great breakfast in the morning included in the price.
This hotel is not very close to anything so expect to spend extra money on taxi’s if you are staying here and don’t have a car. The shower didn’t get very hot and the beds were on wheels that couldn’t lock which was very annoying. (We booked a king and it was just 2 doubles pushed together with a huge crack in middle). The blinds hardly work and it’s very noisy close to the road so I would definitely recommend getting a room near the garden.
"I arrived at the hotel late at night. Receptionist handled check-in efficiently and showed me to my room. I requested double bed since I’m travelling solo, but I was given twin beds. The beds were put together, but with separate beddings. Since it’s very late, I made no protest. Only when I opened the curtains, I felt tricked. Instead of what’s advertised as having ‘garden view’ on Agoda where I booked my room, or on its official website ‘Overlooking the vast resort parklands,’ my room is facing a back alley 3 meters away from next building... I called the front desk expressed my confusion and got reply not long afterwards. I was told that there’s been some kind of mess-up but since the hotel was fully booked they will sort it out the next day. I was also assured that I will be"
"The Raweekanlaya is a small hotel tucked away in a garden like area just a block or so off busy Samsen Road.  Once inside the hotel grounds you would never know one of the busiest thoroughfares in Bangkok is just down the street.  The environment is one of lush greenery throughout, with the rooms encircling the green space and the small pool.  We had top floor rooms over the breakfast area -- one looking out onto the green space/pool area and one toward the back of the hotel (with no real view).  While you could hear people coming and going below you in the morning, it was just normal pedestrian traffic and was quiet in the evening.  Our rooms were small but pretty -- big windows, very clean.  This is a wellness type environment -- they offer massages (which need to be booked"
"We’ve stayed here for 4 nights and it was a great get away from the busy city of Bangkok. We arrived directly from the airport and because the hotel is quite new, not every taxi knows it. Real good and welcoming reception, room as expected. Breakfast good but slow service. We had dinner there 3 nights in a row and discovered a menu with a lot to explore, Lee and Milk were really kind but poor English made the conversation difficult and again, the service was slow even though they were kind and always helpful even if they didn’t always understood! Close to the pier and accessible for all the main tourist attractions along the river, so well located!"
"Stayed in Nov for 3 days.  The hotel is in the middle of a very residential area, in between small apartments and shops. It’s very clean and modern and the staff are very welcoming and hospitable.  You will be amazed at how clean the hotel versus the area it’s in. Rooms are good size, with all amenities covered. They provide bottled water and a welcome fruit basket. Breakfast is adequate and involves a continental breakfast as well as cooked breakfast to order. They have a pool but since it’s surrounded by jungle-esque trees, it isn’t a typical pool holiday experience since sunshine isn’t direct. Staff were great in taking bags and supporting with taxi order etc. Only negative would be that the room didn’t have a window, so was hard to wake up naturally and have sense of the"
"If you just want to simply relax but have no intention of leaving Bangkok, this is the place to be. It is not your standard hotel or lodging house as it offers you something that you don't find in big  hotels here or in many other cosmopolitan cities.  Think of yourself as jungle boy. Tall trees all around you, a pool in the middle. And at night, small frogs croaking. The buildings are not high-rise, more like 2-storey summer lodges. Which makes it so homey.  Couple these with a comfortable bedroom that appears  like your own bedroom in your own home, and very courteous and cheerful staff, and you have what it takes to have a very pleasant and relaxing stay or maybe staycation. And if you plan to visit the Grand Palace or Wat Arun with its beautiful sunset, it will be a breeze"
"Beautiful, quiet and tranquil resort hidden amongst the hustle and bustle that is Bangkok. Rooms, cleanliness, staff and food are all fabulous. 35 minutes from the airport, 10 minutes from Khao San road. The only issue is taxis sometimes have difficulties finding it, but they always managed in the end. Oh and there is mosquitos amongst the plants by the pool, but that can't be helped. This is the second time I have stayed here and would happily stay here again!"
"What a delightful surprise - you turn off a busy street and find yourself in the middle of a garden paradise. Soft beds, great food, wonderful staff, and a pool to boot. Would definitely stay there again if we go to Bangkok. Although we would try to upgrade the room - it was extremely small, and without a window (although most seemed to have them - check before you go)."
It is a vey nice place to stay in a small (boutique) hotel in a middle of Bangkok. I found the room quite small and some rooms have no window. These are the major minuses of this property. Service and staff really great.
"Positives: The staff were extremely welcoming and hospitable. The pool, small but ideal for cooling off with outdoor sofa-bed-loungers to relax on after a day's sightseeing, in a wooded patio-garden setting. Rooms comfortable if a little small.  Negatives: No wardrobe or drawers for clothes! - First hotel I've stayed in like that."
"Pros: delicious breakfast, soft comfy bed, very clean, staff helpful and friendly, well kept hotel area, elegant combination of modernity and traditional interior, top bathroom, close to river ferry (sathew pier)  Cons: taxi drivers are not too happy to drive you there so you need to bargain (hotel calls taxis for you - no need for bargaining! But when you return it might be difficult). Extremely cold aircon in the breakfast room.  Hint: we stayed in room with garden view which was convenient as it is well away from the street. Rooms to the street might be noisy..."
"I stayed at the hotel earlier this month (August) and it is truly one of the best places to stay. The staff was incredibly helpful, polite, and kind. The room was beautiful, clean and very comfortable. Breakfast was great and the location perfect for my business trip. I felt like I was in a sanctuary throughout my stay. I will definitely be coming back"
The hotel was really nice with oldie Thai ambience. The room was well set up like the old house in the past with modern facilities.  I love the poem on the headboard.  I feel like flash back to the reign of King Rama VI. The hotel was greened by the little forest and made me feel really relaxed. The breakfast was really good I really love it. The staff were very friendly and professional. I would definitely return. It is really worth the money.
"High quality hotel which has a homely feel (as opposed to being a tower block). Everything about the hotel is very tasteful (reception building, rooms, pool, gardens, dining room). Great place to be able to come back to for some peace & relaxation. Breakfast was excellent. Staff were attentive & excellent. The pool made it, being able to chill out & cool off was very welcoming. We were leaving late (10pm) so after checking out at lunchtime, we left our luggage and then were able to use the showers next to the pool before heading to the airport. As it's recently opened (April 2017), some taxi drivers didn't know it but the 'taxi card' handed out by reception assisted. Highly recommended."
Had a great stay here. Lovely hotel. Reception staff are very  friendly and helpful. The room was very nice and the bed was comfortable. The breakfast is really good! I hope to come back again and recommend to my friends.
Our family likes to increse experiences by spending our weekend to the new hot challenging resort. The reason we are here because of my friends' recommendation. Great  in warm welcome especailly for soft drink which smells sweet in Thai herb. What such a wonderful of Thai meal! And good hospitality of staffs are magnet for us to return this hotel again
"This hotel is so cozy and warm. When you want to relax, this place is suitable. Staffs are very kind and helpful. Food is very good too. Fresh from garden can heal everything from your tired. Love this place so much and want to come back here soon."
"Had a really enjoyable stay at this cozy but posh boutique hotel. The hotel has probably less than 50 rooms but all the facilities of a large 5 star. The restaurant is a rare find, with 'chaowang' Royal Thai cuisine. So all in all, superb in everyway. Hope to stay there again soon."
