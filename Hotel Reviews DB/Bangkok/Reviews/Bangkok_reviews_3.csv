"I used to stay here for 10 day in January, the hotel was super nice and cheap. Good employees and all are able to speak proper english, this is definitely a plus. Back then the price was around 420baht a night. In March in decided to stay here for 1 night. The price is now about 200 Baht more but the service is still the same. Everything nice, good and super professional. The price is reasonable. The hotel is located near the Si Lom complex with nice restaurants and shops inside. It's close to the lumpini park (15min walking),  close to the Bts Sala Daeng (walking around 8min) and close to the MRT Si Lom (walking around 12min). For short and long stay I can highly recommend the Quarter. With a motorcycle it's only 10min from Asok/ Sukhumvit where the Terminal 21 is located. The"
