"I enjoyed the stay of The quarter hualumphong hotel very much and the most.  Whether it is the service of the employee  Or accommodation  It is the best one I have ever received.

Situated on the 12th Floor, the hotel offers a panoramic view of Bangkok city centre and old town. Did we mention that the hotel is only 10 minutes walk from the Chinatown? Besides Chinatown there are other attractions nearby.  The lobby is modern and spacious. There we met attentive and helpful staff. Khun Noey (‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏¢) and Khun Pound (‡∏õ‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏î‡πå) who assisted us through check-in. The deal we got for superior room with breakfast was undeniable.

And the view from the room is so stunning. Next time I will stay here for sure!! üòâ"
The hotel is a short walk to a street food lane called Soi Sukorn where the local Thai would come eat at street vendors‚Äô pop-up shops each night.  It‚Äôs also close to Chinatown and central station.  Next time I will ride the train and explore the countryside.  The room is spacious and designed in modern Chinese theme.  I didn‚Äôt try the breakfast.  The view from the function room is amazing.
