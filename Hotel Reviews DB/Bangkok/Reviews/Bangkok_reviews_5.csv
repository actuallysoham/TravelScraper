"We've been staying here for 3 nights with my husband all the staff are very polite and always greet us whenever we passed to reception, specially the Filipino staff who always assist us in the breakfast area. i will definitely stay here again in my next visit at Bangkok."
"I've been staying here for almost 3 months already now and i must say that it's worth every penny. It feels like home, the staff are really great and very accommodating specially those from Philippines and ofcourse thai."
"Initially front staff of KAN so kind that upgrade room charge free and I requested late checkout she hearing time and granted.Furthermore she introduced this hotel that easy understanding for shuttle service time to BTS station at Phrom Phong,buffet breakfast time and floor,and pool floor. So clean room comfortable👍  最初にフロントスタッフのKANさんがとても親切で、無料で部屋のアップグレードをしてくれて私のリクエストのレイトチェックアウトを希望時間聞いて叶えてくれました。またホテルの紹介が非常に分かりやすかったです。(BTSプロンポン駅迄のシャトルサービス＆時間・朝食のビュッフェの時間＆フロア・プールのフロア)部屋もとても綺麗で、快適でした👍"
"We stayed at this hotel many times. Staff night shift very polite for us. There are tall guy and another one.  We ask for things more in our room, they can bring it at any time. Very appreciate all of them.  Chk."
"I stayed here last week. When I came to Bangkok, I always stayed to the other hotel before. Fortunately, this time, I stayed here and I felt comfortable with nice service by professional staff, Khun Somo. Love^^"
"This hotel is very wonderful. Such a great service of reception, Nice bellboy also good take care of hosuekeeping.   There are Sai and Moo at reception nice service, really great support. In the middle of city near by Emquartier and Terminal 21.   This is The best place to rest in Bangkok even I have been stayed before, from the BTS Phromphong Station and lil' thing important they have shuttle bus service take me to there easily’"
"This is a great hotel in the heart of phrom phong, close to all amenities and a free shuttle service around the area. Fantastic rooftop pool and gym, as well as a superb breakfast. The staff here are the best, can’t do enough to help you and always so polite. Sai and Somo in particular will go that extra mile to ensure that your stay is as comfortable as possible."
Recommended for the person who want to live nearby the downtown but silent residence. We got the free upgrade so the room install with Big flat internet TV. If you  love to stay in the room and enjoy your show or movies I recommended.
"Very convenient location as there are many restaurants around. The hotel provides a parking area. Room is comfortable enough for one or two people at a reasonable price. The staff were friendly especially Ms Som, she recommended me to very good restaurants call ""Isao"" near the hotel. I will be back soon. Thank you."
"A reasonable room at a reasonable price with nice facility on 8th floor. Wonderful staff with excellent service (Esp. Front desk staff). Great location, it is very closed to the mall and sky train. Very nice to be here :)"
"k.kan and k.meen are very friendly and good take care of us. The room and hotel facilities are very good. Even though the hotel location is far from the public transportation and shopping mall, they also provide you the transportation."
I gonna stay for 22days. Its good for image and nice receptions. But its little bit far from bts or mts. But nice room and comfy  Friendly staff  And around a good restaurant If i back to bangkok i will choose again^^ Thanks for kan and meen
"it's not just the comfy bed, or the 100 channel giant smart TV, the sunny pool or restaurant, the well equipped gym–even the sauna or steam rooms; It's the service driven staff that makes the Quarter PhromPhong exceptional.  After months of staycation, they still treat me to their ear-to-ear grins. Krit, the manager, has gone beyond my increasing requests during these trying times. Then there's Gan, the front office smiling face who also truly takes care in his absence while Sai, Fah, Moo, and Meen juggle the ongoing stream of check-ins and outs who are not as fortunate as I am to be staying here long-term.  Even the food is still tasty as the talented Jin mixes it up and keeps it fresh while Michael, Angie, and Oi are still dishing up their early morning greetings.  And lastly,"
"We are staying for 1 night here we love the people and the food is amazing too and i would love to back here for sure ,and tell to all friend to come back here too thanks for great service and amazing time here"
Warm friendly efficient staff.   Khun Pma really helpful Room well equipped & nice decor& beds very comfortable. Buffet breakfast well presented & with good variety. Kitchen staff are great also. Taxi & motor bike taxi available & good shuttle bus service to sky train. Really enjoy being here!
"We stayed for only a night with 5 rooms in total. Rooms were nice but balcony was too small making it feel congested when you're there. I would prefer having that tiny balcony added into the in room floor area. Upon check-in we requested if a late checkout at 2:00pm would be possible and they said ""only for the 4 rooms and until 1:00pm for the twin room"" so we were fine with that. We checked-in around 4:00pm and they gave us 2 rooms first saying that the other 3 rooms were not ready yet because we want rooms on the same floor (isn't it obvious that all bookings were named after 1 person and there's a high probability that we would need rooms on the same floor?), we turned a blind eye on that because we want to have a swim first.  The next day we swam again after breakfast--"
"Easy to travel by bts, near a lot famous place (pub, bar in thonglor). If anyone wanna to hang out for several day, this would be your choice because it has good service and comfortable room, also there are cheap price which could tangible. @Kan"
"This is the kind of hotel that I love: mid-size, great location, superb facilities and quality breakfast.  Staffs are well trained and fitness center and pool are very good.  There are good restaurants nearby that the locals and the expats frequent."
highly recommend this place the facility is  awsome also the room is  great clean and comfortable.also the breakfast fantastic also the staff nice and friendly specially  thanks to Mr. michael he help me a lot. we pretty sure we visit again this hotel
"Great price. Great Location. With one side of the property faces another building, it might be hit or miss with the room you are assigned to. Try to get a room on the west side, or front, to avoid claustrophobic-mood room. The water pressure is strong but it is one of those places that you cannot really get a fix water temperature. The warm water can turn hot in cycles. Like other UHG managed properties, the hotel is clean, offers a good selection of breakfast, and courteous staff."
"Fantastic Hotel,i been there for my first experience with some kids from Pattaya for(2weeks)football camp ,great staff. I will like to thanks all the staff: Micheal,Angie,Raymond,Aoi,P.Ma And Aui.🙏👍"
"The location is  perfect! Sitting in the prestige area of Sukhumvit 31. Only 7 mins walk to the Phromphong BTS. (There’s also free shuttles by hotel ) luxury malls and diverse of restaurants nearby. The breakfast is International breakfast all you can eat buffet style. Food are delicious and the service is always professional and warming. Thank you Raymond, Angie and Michael  for your kind service at the cafe! Also, great great job to other front desk staff Amy, Mickey ,Beam, Guy, And Oui !

New hotel in good location if you want to stay at Sukhumvit area .Have mall and restaurants not so far from here. The hotel have good facilities nice swimming  pool at the roof top. The room is new and clean and have small balcony which you can see partial  city view from room. Breakfast is very good they have many Thai selection and taste delicious and the Staff there his name is Raymond and another Thai lady they’re so nice friendly and have good customer service. Definitely I will come back again.
"Stayed in The Quarter from Oct 14th to 18th. Very impressed, great value for money modern rooms, incredible staff thanks Nui, Aui, toy and shuttle driver Pop. Pop saw me walking back to the hotel, recognised me as a guest and stopped and picked me up. Not part of the shuttle service and very much appreciated as it poured with rain 2 minutes later."
"In the centre of everything. 12-min walk to The Emquatier shopping mall. 10 mins to Villa Market supermarket. Lots of great coffee shops, restaurants, and spas within walking distance.  I have been staying here for the last 6 nights. The hotel is very new. The room is very clean. No nice view from the room, but that’s what you would expect from the most competitive price in the area. The parking is a bit limited and the staff can be too busy during crowded hours. But overall, I can say that the staff are trying their best to accommodate what you need.  P Ma, the concierge, is very friendly and always helped me carry heavy stuff to the room and the car for me. I really appreciate his help."
"The stay is pleasant and convenient. The staff is super friendly and helpful . All the staff including Beam, Oi who made my stay soothing and relaxing .   The room is very cozy. The bed is super comfy and creational area is very pleasant ."
"It's time for an update to express my continued thanks, this time to gracious restaurant staff at this conveniently located hotel.  Ably led by restaurant manager Michael, Angie, Raymond, and the new Thai wait person, named Oi, always brighten my morning with their big smiles and generous greetings.  They are quick to offer the ""eggs your way"" menu and direct us to the additional (mostly) Thai hot buffet. Kudos the the kitchen crew for, as already mentioned in my previous review, ""keeping it fresh"" as the tasty selection changes daily.  Also, a warm shout out to the staff member who put together the humorous note alerting us that ""Spiderman"" would be dangling from roof as maintenance and window cleaning were performed:)"
Nice hotel with good staff and excellent service (hospitallity). The hotel is located in the center of the city. Near to seven eleven and have shuttle car to BTS  asoke and phrompong. Near mall Emquartier and emporium. Thanks to P. Ma for always helping us...
"I’ve been a long term guest here with my fiancé since the start of the covid pandemic back in April and I am still here in October. The hotel staff are all really helpful. Great service. Ma, Mickey, Beam, Amy, Sky and all the other staff are always there to greet us with a smile and offer help when needed. Would highly recommend other travelers who are looking for a comfortable and easily accessible hotel with great services"
"my visit is only a stopover before heading to the north.  Very surprise when I got into the room, I paid 22 euro for deluxe room with balcony. but the room is very clean, new furniture. and modern.  my room was only on the level 2 with no view but who cares.  Very good service,  front desk are very helpful and friendly. the cleaner ms Fhasia is very lovely and smiley,  i meet her in the lift, gym and pool she said hi and smiled eveytime. but I had no time eating at the restaurant.   City view on the rooftop pool is pleasing . overall, I like this small hotel and the unexpecting service they gave me.  Only the nearby construction woke me up at  8. Anyway, I will be there again soon"
"Clean room and service is excellent. location is supreme as it locates in middle of Bangkok near by Emquatier department store, 7-11 convenient store, public park and many famous restaurants. The reception I meet  is K.Mickey"
The place is in the center of city. There has a many places for look around. No need to choose a balcony view because of the neighbor so close. There is near The emporium shopping center and BTS (skytrain) Prompong station too.
"Helpful staff, speak English. Nice breakfast.  I want to thank Alú for the help and hospitality !  This is the center of the city, good location.  There is a parking. Excellent view at the 8th floor , swimming pool area."

"Great service and accommodation. Good facilities, swimming pool fitness and room were all great. Location is good in the heart of sukhumvit. Good cafes nearby. Parking space is decent. We got an early check in and was great (Beam)"
"The reception staff named Beam is really nice. The hotel is very clean. Suggest for everyone. It is located in the town. Easy to go everywhere by bts or Grab. I very suggest it for couple, student, teach, every occupation."
"The hotel for the price is wonderful. The receptionist Ami was so helpful and friendly when she welcomed us. Ami explained all the hotel facilities and was kind enough to arrange a take away breakfast too as we had a very early checkout the following day. The room was very clean, good big bed, everything you need. I used the gym, steam room and pool all perfect. Breakfast was varied and plentiful all staff very friendly and helpful. Love the location. Would definitely stay here again and recommend."
"My mom and I went to bkk for the business. We are looking for hotel and found this.  ✅The price is very contrast with the room. The room is very clean and perfect.  ✅The staff is very nice. Her name is Beam. She guided us every detail of the hotel. I feeling like staying at home here. The service is very good.  ✅The security, driver, and the man on the 2nd floor are good at English. ✅ The House keepers are also nice.  ✅ I love this place and I will come back here. See ya"
"Immediately on arrival we had a warm welcome from the friendly staff, collected our bags from our taxi and we received a welcome drink while we checked in. Without asking, we were offered a room on a higher floor without asking. When we got to the room it was just like the photos - great design, huge floorspace, option of shower, modern decor. The safe was really easy to use, The location was good - near Asoke sky train station, which is a 15 minutes walk away and gives you access to other stations and locations, like the subways. Thank you Aui for your information. Amazing hotel would definitely  recommend and stay here again"
"A very Big thank you to the Manager of this hotel Maud, thank you to her and her team, i was in a complicated situation and nevertheless she did all she could to help me and always with a smile, i am grateful for her help and kindness, i would like to thank her and the whole team, all have great service, from reception to housekeeping the staff is always super friendly and ready to help, Will definitly come back  thank you to Maud the manager and her team"
"Clean with good service and good breakfast quality, price is acceptable, location near convenience store and shopping mall. The hotel has free shuttle bus to the sky train. Staff Khun Beam provided good advice and friendly."
"The hotel is new , clean. Located in convenience location. The hotel has proper parking space inside the building.  Thanks Mickey, Ami for upgrading my room. The breakfast is superb with variety kind of food, and coffee machine is one of my favorite here. There are many Pilipino staff who can speak very good English and Thai.  I definitely recommend this hotel."
"We loved the kindness of the staff, very attentive and professional.The room was clean, spacious, beautifully decorated, nice service friendly staff Thank you K.Aui for welcoming when we check in. Will come back again."
"It seems only fair to continue to update my experience as I will probably become or am already The Quarters longest residing guest.  First, my thanks and compliments to Khun Ohm for immediately taking swift and decisive action on the curtain issue in the bedroom.  Housekeeping has been fantastic all around. They are perhaps the sweetest, yet most invisible people in the entire hotel. However, I deeply appreciate and acknowledge their presence.   At FNB, there is a young gentleman who is always cheery and has a memorable hair style. There is another host who stoically yet efficiently runs the floor - always offering bacon or omelette. The lady also is all smiles during breakfast.  The trifecta of front desk ladies: the assistant manager, the courteous Filipina, and Beam all seem"
"Only stayed one night after late worked and lazy to travel home. Location quite far from BTS .. not walkable you need taxi or motorbike to get in, it located inside Soi Sukhumvit 31. They also have free shuttle to BTS but it quite limit of time, you can ask reception for it.     Very nice staffs from reception, shuttle driver and restaurant staffs.   Room is ok. Floor a bit dirt i found some sticky spots right away after step inside the room but I had slipper for it so that still ok. I like the bed, smart TV and hot shower there. AC work properly no noise but room not really soundproof I still can heard people talk or walked pass the door. In room also provided coffee and tea bags , 2 bottles of water complimentary and some bathroom amenities. Their shower gel and hand gel also"
"Nice place to stay, location is good but the hot water is not stable. I’ve been here three times in the past two months yet it hasn’t been fixed yet... please fix it... Look forward into stable hot water for my next stay."
"Really helpful staff - came very quickly to solve any problems we had, opened doors, smiled and super friendly. I had some calls that I needed to make and they let me use the meeting room to do so - really flexible. Rooms with the bath are surprisingly spacious. Downtown and easy to walk to both of the big shopping malls. Would stay again."
"Great hotel, super friendly staff.  We have now used this hotel many times when in Bangkok and it will always be my Go to hotel from Now.  Pool is super nice.   We have had apartment, regular room, executive room and all good options.  Even got a free upgrade  Great hotel well recommended."
"The hotel is convenience from BTS Phrom Phong. They have driver to pick up us at Emquarter. Staff(K.Beam) have been nice. Moreover, she accept early check-in. It’s comfortable for working. The swimming pool is great.  👍🏻"
Just checked into our hotel and was instantly greeted by Beam who was extremely accommodating and patient with us and explained all the services available here and her information was clearly explained with recommendations. Very happy we picked this place to stay for our anniversary and happy to have Beam at the front desk check us in!
"Excellent service and reception by the receptionist Aui, great room comfortable clean and modern, once again Aui very helpful with everything I needed he is and will attend to your every need, good hotel to spend your vacation and easy access to the center very convenient"
"to Be honest, it’s difficult to find a good hotel like that and not to expensive. Everything was absolutely perfect. I mean... when I stop in a town to rest after my road trips, I need a good room, a nice big pool to swim and a gym. They have everything and in addition the breakfast is pretty generous. I was super happy. The staff is really nice too! Thanks to Aui. I had some laundry and job stuff to do and he was really helpful. I definitely recommend this place!"
"What a wonderful stay! I'd stayed here only two nights but it was very impressive!...very nice hotel. Close to the main nightlife.Just about 15 minutes walk to Sukhumvit Road and commercial centers like Emquartier.Good breakfast, amazing staff, friendly and helpful. Many thanks to Aui for his amazing service!"
"Where to start? drop my car secure parking. My room was a suite room, wow, with everything you would ever need, large bath shower unit, hairdryer etc, huge 6ft square bed, flatscreen tv, fridge, room safe, gowns, slippers drink-making facilities, the list is endless, and would not justify how good this hotel is valued what you paid for. If your looking for a central Bangkok hotel then this is it. Staff friendly and excellent speak english, Thanks to Aui for a good info."
Thanks Aui for the help getting a taxi while it was almost impossible getting one due to the rain. We had a flight to catch! Nice hotel. Beds were very confy. Nice gym and pool aswel. We enjoyed the breakfast. We def recommend this hotel.
"After a long drive, I arrived at the hotel 2 hours before check in. The room I booked wasn’t ready so they gave me a free upgrade. Location is great. It’s my second time here and I’ll be back again. Check-in is extremely fast and efficient too! Beam was the woman who helped me, very friendly and speaks great English!"
"I have been living in this hotel for almost 3 months due to the COVID situation as I cannot get back home just yet. It has been a really enjoyable experience, such a nice and new hotel. It has a nice pool and gym with good equipment, a good restaurant with reasonable prices and nice food. The rooms are really great, 5g internet, comfortable beds, big flat screen tv and they are a good size room too. Above all the staff are just fantastic.  A nice mix of Thai and Philippine hotel team really provide such a high standard of service at all times. Always a smiling and friendly face whenever you arrive or leave the hotel. The rooms and housekeeping are also excellent and everything is clean. A big mention for the front desk team who are just superb in what they do every day. Ohm,"
"It's one of the nicest hotels in BKK, located in Sukhumvit which is a business area.  The  room price is reasonable and the room itself  is very clean and big  enough. Staff members are very friendly and very helpful.  There are a nice  rooftop and mini golf in the hotel that are very wonderful.  Furthermore, you can find food easily in this area , many restaurants and street food nearby.  Thank you Mr. Aui for a good service"
"Amazing stay at the Quarter ! The staff was so friendly and helping, especially Ari and Pop, looking forward to coming back here ! The view from the pool is great, the breakfast is delicious and the room are quite decent"
"What a fantastic place to enjoy the CV19 lockdown!  Management was a dream to deal with as they empathized with our situation.  Stressful times were silky smoothed to the point of perfection as the hotel's amenities were kept clean and safe at all times.  The staff took a certain pride in their attendance to detail and guest comfort.  The kitchen crew made the buffet breakfast a joy as we wondered, ""What will they serve today?"" Good coffee too!  I would certainly stay there again!"
Khun Aui and Khun Mund did give is an excellent service. Location is decent. Pool and gym facilities are good for we paid. But the room we stayed has a blocked view. That's the only unfortunate. The rest is good :)
"I stayed here with a friend in a 1 bed apartment suite.  Suite was immaculately clean,Spacious and modern in design.  Looks exactly like the photos and bed is very comfortable.  Staff here are all very friendly and polite. Reception staff speak perfect English and are very helpful.  Breakfast selection is international and very good for the price you pay.  Location is fantastic and the pool gets sun aaaaall day.  Will definitely stay again! I realise I said “very” a lot. But I stand by it!"
"Thank you all staff here Khun Ohm , Khun Beam , Khun Aui and Khun Ma for nice support , friendly and good service . Great location in a center of bkk. Easy transport and closed to department stroe 💓💓"
"Title says it all! Aui was amazing for the moment we checked in, super friendly and welcoming! Definitely coming back! Location is very close to shops and bts and rooftop pool was awesome!!! Thanks Aui and team!"
"This was my first visit to the property and I was pleasantly surprised. Whilst the car parking is limited the security found me a place without delay. I was upgraded when checking in and the receptionist was cheerful and helpful. My Room whilst small was perfectly adequate and the bed was very comfortable. The kitchenette was clean and well stocked with plates, glasses etc. The was a TV in the bedroom and one in the lounge area and the bathroom was modern with all the amenities one could want."
"I enjoyed my stay at the Quarter a lot, I expected it to be good but my experience was even better. The price is amazing for what you will get, my stay was fantastic.  Incredible bed, huge and comfortable, you will sleep like a baby. Clean bathroom with great rainshower. For a small price you will get an amazing breakfast with fresh buffet, a high variety of western, Asian, fresh fruits and good coffee. The staff was very Helpful, kind and polite, big thanks for Aui for taking care very well!"
"This place is superb value for money, great pre check in service with a free pick up from BTS Station and then a free upgrade on arrival (thanks to Aui in reception....so helpful and polite!)  The room is small but well put together, very modern with all the facilities you'd need and VERY clean.  Would definitely recommend this place 😊"
"The hotel is near BTS Phromphong and shopping mall e.g., Emporium and Emquatier. In a nice weather, you can walk around 15 mins, but if you lazy, you can use hotel shuttle service. The staffs was so helpful and friendly especially Khun Aui. He helps us to find and arrange the room according to our requirements e.g., early check-in. Our room was very comfortable and clean. This hotel absolutely a place I would come back to:)"
"The Quarter Phromphong is the new hotel in the heart of Bangkok (Sukhumvit31). Nice beautiful design room & every clean. Mr. Ohm, Mr.Aui and Mr.Phop is every friendly and amazing service mind. They upgraded the 1 bedroom type for me"
"AU AND PHOP is very friendly and kind  The room is very comfordtable and beautiful . The hotel is near most places ex: park , Bts skytrain , department store easy to find..I will come agian . Thank you"
"We are a couple who stayed at The Quarter for the first time. We requested a room with a bathtub, and big thanks to Mr.Ohm and Mr.Ari, they upgraded for us! Also, the room is super duper clean and as expected from what we’ve from the picture."
Ami Ohm and Beam at the front desk are great.  Booked for 1 night to check out the area then decided to stay longer due to the great service and amenities.  Ami speaks English and is very helpful in running the hotel.  The shuttle bus is awesome they run at certain times and instead of me asking they as you if you need a lift.  May other places you have to ask.  Ami can also help you get to a certain place if there is some language barrier.  I would stay again if had to be in area.  The park is not so far to run and hang out and same with the mall.  Only thing is the gym is small but it’s ok because you can just work out on the roof where the pool is.
Although not big but looks modern and perfect. A staff name Beam take care and helpful everything. One bed room is big and comfortable for the price. Great location near BTS and shopping mall. Surely. I will come back:))
Nice decorations for living in a limited space. Perfect for a long-term stay and also highly recommended for daily stay. Welcomed from the reception. K.Beam was very nice and helpful. Feeling safe and comfortable.
"The service of this place was literally great. A staff named ‘Beam’ was really helpful, she did give a great solution. You would feel the staffs provide service with all of their heart. I would highly recommend this place."
Received good welcome from Muan & very attentive to guest concerns.TThe rooms I wanted was not available & Muan managed to get me on highrt floor with an upgradeTthe rooms amenities/cleanliness for the price being charged is very very fair.I would visit this place again.The room is really very very clean.The bed is big though no bath tub the shower room have ample of space & one does not need to squeeze in.
"I have booked and paid for the superior room but they are already full when I’m about to check in. Luckily, I got the upgraded room from the front office here(K’Beam) with no upgrade room fee. Guys it such a good complement. I am really appreciated and definitely I will back to stay here again in the future. Good service, good room, great night"
"Everything perfect and amazing! There are amazing beds, amazing breakfast, good location, good view and good restaurant. Staff are very nice and help me with everything. Absolutely, I will be back there again."
The staff was super helpfully.Ami&Ma was friendly too I'm booking room on facebook page. Admin reply my messages really really fast. xD If you have any question you can ask him on facebook too! beds were super cozy and comfortable Location near BTS Promprong and The Emquartia. You can ask the hotel shuttle bus service to bts without charge too (but before 3.30pm)
"The rooms are amazing. Great bed. Great shower. Great TV. Great Breakfast. Great staff. Nice gym and great rooftop pool. Low price.  Special thanks to Ohm, Avi, Ami, and Mund for their kindness and hospitality!"
"Amazing place very luxurious and clean ! We originally had a problem about the free breakfast with booking.com they made a mistake, but the friendly staff member Aui went above and beyond to get us the free breakfast will definitely be staying here again."
Perfect location in Phromphong Bts and close to Emquartier.  Rooms and facilities are verry good. Staff are doing an excellent job. I d like to thankful to Aui. He was very helpful for my document. I love this place. #aui
"Perfect location in Sukhumvit. Close to Terminal21, EM Quarter and many good restaurants. Ohm and his team are doing an excellent job! Rooms and facilities new and very good standard. Will return for sure. Christian"
"First of all, I'd like to thank Ami, Beam and Phop for taking care of me in this trip very well and Miss Ratchadawan for helping me booked the room. I love the design and how they decorated the hotel. The room is very clean and nice! And the best part that I love is facilities, which is GYM, high quality equipment. I'll return again and again!"
"My second time staying here. I really enjoyed it! The room was just like in the pictures, a bit small, but very clean and new. Towels are soft, good quality and smell so nice. Comfy bed with internet TV!! You can log in to Netflix, Apple TV, Youtube etc. with your own account, but don't forget to log out before check out. The location is great. You can take a long walk to the BTS or take a free shuttle from the hotel. The staffs are very friendly and helpful. Thank you Amy :)"
"Quite conveniently located, the hotel is a great little gem. Very tastefully furnished pristine rooms - mine was anyway. Whilst not huge, the room was very comfortable with a great bed and bedlinen. Perfect for a good night sleep. The team members, especially those at reception, were always very friendly and helpful - always with a smile - small but highly important thing especially since my stay was during the Covid-19 crisis.   Special mention goes to the shuttle service the hotel provides to the nearby BTS PhromPhong/ EMquartier shopping centre - on one of my excursions out of the hotel, the driver, who had somehow recognised me (i was several minutes away from the hotel by then), stopped to offer me a ride as he was going past - it was a gesture but one that goes a long way."
I stayed there for 7 days. The room services were ok. It was definitely a pleasure to stay in the place. All of the staffs were so cordial and humble. I will definitely recommend.wish you have a pleasant and enjoyable stay.
I have a good time staying at the quarter :) will definitely stay again. The staff Ohm and Mund were super great and helpful :) Other staffs at the kitchen also helped me warm my outside food as well. I really enjoyed staying there
"Very impressive ! Nice & Clean hotel.It s much of comfortable stay with full amenities. Staff K.Beam ,receptionist she is smile prompt service and kindly gave of the information details. I will recommend friends to book The Quarter ! Thank You."
Aum and Ami and the rest of the staff are incredible here. The price of the rooms compared to the service is a steal. I would highly recommend this place and want to tell you that the staff here is out going and also very helpful including the hard working security guys and the house keepers. Aum and Ami thank you again and keep up the great work!!!!
We stayed here for one night Mr. Sompob and Miss Amy had a excellent service when we were check-in and check-out. The room and facilities are pretty good. We will come back here again next time for sure.
"I am staying there for few weeks. Room is very new (i went to many hotel, most of them are old renovated including 5 stars). The breakfast is very complete including cheese, bacon and eggs. I like real  coffee with milk foam and there is a machine making what you want like american coffee or barista. The swimming pool on the top is big enough to swim and relax. The place definitely worth the money paid. In addition, the staff is good from managers to house keepers, special thanks to Jida and Aul for the welcoming."
"We stayed 17-18 April 2020. The hospitality at the check in counter was impeccable. The room was very cosy, clean and modern looking. Great views of the city from the rooftop-pool and excellent breakfast. Will be back this weekend!!!"
"The hotel is very good for short and long-term stays with nice location. All staffs are kind and service mind (Especially thanks to Khun Aum & Khun Beam, I got an early check-in by 4 hours with NO extra charge). There is also the free shuttle riding to BTS Phromphong. Highly recommended this place."
