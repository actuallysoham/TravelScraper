"The room is new, clean and modern. The location is amazing, so close to bts ari. Very convenience. Enough parking and the parking is big enough and not scary like some buildings in Bangkok. There're boots and 7-11 in the building. The room's got super nice view. K.Ting and k.Virat are very kind and helpful."
"Clean and convenient room. Nice staffs who always answer my question esp. N‚Äô nam, the a/c in my room has a problem at the midnight but this hotel is available service all 24 hrs, the officer came and fixed it immediately."
"Thank you team of the quarter hotel for this beautiful stay. The Ari district is great to explore with a lot of nice restaurants, bars and cafes. But Especially the welcoming day with the arrangement was awesome. Thank you thai ghan"
"It s a Great location, really pleasant and clean rooms, but the thing that makes this such a good place to stay are the staff.   Let s come to staycation here. Beautiful hotel and convenient hotel. Impressive."
"I was stayed in this hotel on August 2020, nice place, nice room, beautiful pool on the rooftop. Staffs are so kind and helpful, especially K. DEW(GSA) who took care of us in the early morning for checked out. I really this hotel because of full of facilities. Breakfast was perfect with beautiful panorama view. Once I get a chance to visit Bangkok, definitely I'll pick this hotel again for sure."
Very Bad Experience in this hotel.  Very bad receptionist  SCAM hotel 2000 baht for a stain on the sheet with bleach the stain is gone. I pay 4000 for one week and 2000baht for the sheet ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨  NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL !!!!!!
Very nice rooftop swimming pool and gym. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The staff is very friendly and works on a professional level. Especially  Boy is always very kind and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Bangkok!üëç
"Location 5/5 Close to BTS Ari & bus stop also have many restaurants all the way. **Front of the building also have Amazon Cafe, Starbucks, pizza and 7/11.   Room 4/5 Clean and comfy. I might give 5 if air-conditioning sounds better than what I heard during my stay. Seems like the structure wasn't that good like it present.  Food 4/5 Breakfast tasted good and have variety choice."
"The Quarter Ari by UHG is a very nice modern hotel and it is appointed modern high rise hotel with good facilities including a number of shops and restaurants located on the first couple of floors and the hotel has 180 rooms all with good views.  There is a very well equipped gymnasium, one of the best I have seen in hotels and there is a rooftop cafe and pool which offers excellent views across Bangkok.  The hotel is located about 10 mins walk form the BTS Sky train so it is within walking distance from BTS Ari Station  The rooms are large comfortable nd well appointed and I would recommend this hotel. It is good value for money, clean and comfortable.  Pros: Modern new hotel over 34 floors Great views from the rooms or rooftop pool area Freeform infinity pool Fully equipped"
"Enjoyed staying here! In my opinion the hotel offers good value for money, rooms are nice and big and the gym is very good, aswell. And the staff is friendly, too. Would stay here again when in Bangkok."
"My second time here. The hotel product is just like a photo and new. BUT staff need to be trained! except bell boy(They're all nice, active and helpful). I feel they're not welcome since we arrived. We were there early than the check-in time but I called them already and a lady said she will prepare a room for us. I did a check-in process with bell boy(registor) and gsa ask me to take a seat and wait for the room. Then we wait for 15-20 mins which is fine for us cuz we know that we arrive early. Then we got the key, went to our room and while we were relaxing the housekeeper try to open the room door with only one knock and open it immediately but we use a double lock inside so she couldn't get in and realize that guests are in the room. We were shocked, my partner open the door"
"I come here many time. For this time I feel like aVip person. staff name K kean , k Rose K lookmee  do for me as this is my second home. I recommend is the people find the good hotel. Beleive my stay ."
"First time here. I love the location near  by sky train. Room ok with good price. Sevice very good as 5 stars, Rose , Lookmee take  a good care on checking in.  Will be back again with big family on February."
The hotel got a nice city view and reception staff are welcoming. The one who named pang was so friendly and helpful. The deluxe room was so comfortable and reasonably priced. I would definitely come back here again.
"I just pass there to take a relax for a few day. I saw a very good price here , then tried one night for my experience.     Of cause, this wow! for the room with a nice of the city view together with this location near by sky train, 7-11 minimart  and some place night life .      Also staff there good take care, Rose, and one girl difficult name Haein. They were do warm welcome like I am a VIP customer.....Sure will be back again, love this place. Be impressive."
"It was an amazing hotel! Highly recommend everyone to choose this hotel when visiting Bangkok! Nice location, nice service and nice facilities! Fantastic! Especially Nat, who works at the reception was so kind and helped me a lot. If got chance, I would definitely come here again."
"This is my first time to be UHG customer. It is beyond expectation for this price. Good location, excellent services, nice room and very nice view on sky lounge. You can walk to many many good reasturents."
"Rooms are clean and spacious, staff is friendly and helpful, breakfast buffet is fantastic, and location, about a 10 minute walk to the BTS Ari station is very convenient. Also lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. Best of all was the price, which during low season was very affordable. We loved our stay here."
I got the room at a very competitive price probably due Covid. The room was very clean and comfortable with all the amenities we could looking for. The position is very good abd I could moving in the city easily. The staff is very nice and I will back here for sure
"This is my favorite hotel in Bangkok and from UHG chain. Stayed at different UHG hotels and by far this is the best among them.  Whenever I stay at this hotel I feel very at home and had peaceful sleep. Luckily, I got the same room I had during my birthday.  Felt very happy!   The staff and management were accommodating! Forgot their names but all of them are amazing! Kudos to the one who arrange my special request.  If you stay here you will get your money's worth with excellent service. I will keep returning back."
Excellent hotel with great location! I was there for just only one night but leaving with a lot of lovely memories. The staff are very nice and kind especially the lady names Aor-Ae. She was giving me an early check-in and seeking the room which is match to my reference. I would never forget this memorable stay. Keep up on your good working!!!
Hotel is new and facilities are fine. Room is fine. However first day we checked in we found hair in bathroom sink. How it can pass SHA? Also on first day housekeeping didn't set up hand towels and have only body towels.   Bed is comfortable however rooms are not soundproof. Our next door neighbors were watching TV late in the evening and in the morning. You can hear every word from TV in other room. How it is possible for 4 star hotel?  Breakfast was more like a mess than experience. Choices are subpar. Variety of of food more remind me of 3 star hotel. Waffles station. You need to make waffles by yourself. Egg Station when I came was unattended. Only one good thing is coffee machine. It is nice but also not properly set up as latte need to be served in tall glass however near
First time staying here for service is really good  I come to check in before 2pm. staff k. Earth give me a special early checkin thank you for your kindness. Room also clean enough and the best is view form room is so nice. I recommend for this hotel.
"Impressed with welcome work  Check in early.  Because during the stay there was a room available, the staff named Nut provided a very good service.  If there is a chance to come and stay again.üòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä"
"We arrived early to the hotel before our set check in time and the welcoming and caring receptionist allowed us to enter our room early. As we first walked in, we had an amazing room with everything a four star hotel should include."
"It was a very good experience I stayed here.  I was greeted by a staff name Lookmee.  She's not just beautiful, she also took good care of it,  spoke well, funny  and good attitude to me.  She impressed me with this place.  And moreover that, the room which she choose was nice, clean, good view, suitable for relaxation a lot.  Of course I have to come back again."
"It's my first time, I have stayed here. The location was really good, you can walk few minutes to Ari station nearby. And very nice the hotel with a view, clean and good service by staff name is Miss. Lukmee always smile, friendly and nice talking when I was asking some questions. Thank you and come back again!"
I have chance to Stay at quarter ari before booking here I checked the reviews and it seems ok but when I arrived there for checkin it was so amazing It not take a time like I read very fast check in.staff K.earth is very good service and polite sorry for little girl who work with k.earth she also nice and good information that she informed to guest but my bad I didn‚Äôt notice her name. For room are good nice view and the swimming pool are amazing 360 of Bangkok view
"Due to the circumstances of the current Coronavirus pandemic we didn‚Äôt have the option of travelling to the hotel , the country that we are from closed its borders and all flights going out were either cancelled or changed to a different date. In regards to all this we decided to write to the hotel two weeks before our journey to ask if we could change the date of our arrival we didn‚Äôt want a refund but simply a change of date however the hotel did not fulfil  our request as it did not think the pandemic was anything different and it said it operated as usual. We are extremely disappointed with the decision of the hotel as this is the only hotel that didn‚Äôt take our request on board and accepted our proposal but the other two we contacted we didn‚Äôt have a problem with"
This is 1st time I rest here .It such a nice place to take a rest in Bangkok. Special thanks to all staff at the front.Thanks Khun Nat to provided a great service to me. I definitely recommend this place to stay here.
"We stayed the second time here. Everything is amazing, the rooms, the pool and the breakfast. Mr. Boy and Nit from the reception took care of all our wishes. Best place in Bkk! We will come back for sure!"
"We love the bangkok view in our room, by the pool and especially the bathtub.   But they were understaffed when we went, so service was average. Also security wasn‚Äôt very impressive. Anyone can go and out of the hotel. They also take covid 19 precautionary measures lightly. They didn‚Äôt even check our temperatures."
"This is our 4th month running here in The Quarter Ari by UHG and we are loving it! Special thanks to the management team for making sure we are having a comfortable stay here. I especially would like to mention front desk staff Khun Nat who is absolutely a sweetheart and a wonderful person, for always providing us great service out of her way whenever we need any help or assistance. Would definitely recommend this place for a great stay."
"This is our second time, perhaps not beautiful, but all the lovely checkout staff speak very nicely, especially the staff name is Pae. Because we're working the same way the first thing to impress the customer is to be a good service mind.  Wansuk Team leader hotel"
"Due to Covid19,  we spent two and a half months living at The Quarter Ari.  We can't begin to thank the amazing staff enough for their care and understanding while we were at the hotel.  From the breakfast staff to the reception staff (especially Nat and Suki), everyone went out of their way to make sure we had what we needed and were taken care of.  We originally stayed in a double room, but then moved into a suite when we realized we would be staying longer.  The accommodations were very comfortable even for a long stay, and the amenities were great, especially the rooftop pool and fitness room.  I highly recommend staying here if you're in Bangkok and want to stay in the Ari district."
"Very nice and clean hotel, the staff is very friendly and helpful. The room is clean and comfortable the bed is amazing I slept like a baby. The breakfast is delicious with many choices I recommend the broccoli soup. The swimming pool has a stunning view. I will be back definitely for my next trip in Bangkok."
Hotel is situated Ari business district. Very new Hotel with everything within walking distance.  Swimming Pool and Gym is amazing.  SUKI and NAT are the best guest service agent. You can ask for their help anytime you stay!!!!!  Ao and Booth are also very helpful.
"From the moment I entered the building to check-in I had a positive experience. Door man quickly came to help my stuff from the taxi, smooth and quick check in and was impressed with my room. I love a new fresh building and this hotel is new and modern. Rooftop Sky Bar and swimming pool and GYM with fantastic day and night view. Great breakfast, beautiful indoor and terrace restaurant facing the city view from the 22th floor. I am speechless with quality and comfort in this hotel and you're reading from someone who is picky with hotels. Special thanks to the gorgeous looking front desk staff named Suki with professionalism and great charisma, I love you and will continue to stay and be back in future."
"Insufficient cleaning seevice twice a week... Only two towels in the bathroom and nothing for hands and face.   The hotel was supposed to be new but instead it is already old: shower full of limestone, water infiltration throughout the bathroom. Whose door opens so antifunctionally.   In the bedroom a long laminate top is recessed into the wall without even a lateral support and flexes downwards:  a HUGE design error! The staff is unresponsive and hardly cares about guests.   There is an urgent need for a change of management and start doing maintenance."
From the beginning the experience at this hotel was great. Min and Nam at the front took care of us and helped us with a wonderful room. I can't believe how good is the value here. This is my new top recommendation to family and friends in BKK.
"A week ago I've celebrated my birthday at this hotel. They made it extra special because the staff and management are wonderful and responsive to my request.   An 8-12mins walk(depends on how fast you walk) from BTS Ari Exit 4,there's starbucks, 711, pizza company, pharmacy, mini talat in front of the building and restos nearby  You won't regret staying here, affordable with superb service! My friends are envious of the beautiful pics I took during my stay. They are too, looking forward to their future stay!"
"When I came, there were stains on the linen and it all diid not seem to be fresh. Also the pillows had awful odour. I called to the reception. It was 9 pm. They were very ""surprised"" to hear that I want to change the linen ""so late"". I waited 30 minutes for somebody to come and had to call them a few times. A guy came to change the linen. I left the room for a while. Later I found out that my international charger worth 40 euro disappeared... They are supposed to refund any loss up to 5000 Bahts. but they did not give me anything. They said that the cleaning staff say they did not take anything... Of course, what else should the staff say? I had to lock all belongings all the time when I was leaving room.  Plus - I had very noisy neighbours, the TV was on all the time until 2"
"Excellent hotel. Decent clean room with a good center of bangkok‚Äôs view, staff are nice especially khun. Suki she very helpful with professional manner. Totally value of money for business and family stay"
"Really enjoyed the atmosphere of the Hotel, very modern and elegant(especially the white marbles in the Lobby). All of the Staff was friendly and very helpful. The view from the 22nd floor during breakfast in the morning and the view from the 33rd floor in the Evening very amazing. It‚Äôs like you can relax and still being in the middle of Bangkok. Would definitely stay there again!"
"The best place to stay in Bangkok, not far from BTS skytrain station. Swimming pool is very wonderful city view. Room is comfortable stay, many shop and mini mart at the ground floor. Staff service is good"
"Amazing room with an incredible view and ensuite bathroom.  Amazing rooftop pool and bar. Amazing breakfast included, wide selection on the buffet. Good location, short walk to the skytrain and to nearby restaurants  Nothing negative to say about it"
"My husband and I arrived at this hotel earlier this month, and so far we are loving it! It is indeed a gem and the rooms and the overall atmosphere is truly amazing! Thanks to Mr Jet for his warm welcome and hospitality for showing us around and helping us choose a room according to our taste! Breakfast is also great with plenty options. Definitely worth staying!"
"I do recommend the quarter Ari by UHG. This was my second visit in a month. It was a really pleasant stay. The room and the view were super amazing. I got upgraded my room to be two-bed-room suite. For the couple travelers, I totally recommend this room. You got the bathtub with the spectacular view of Bangkok. The bathroom was huge, clean, and new. I gave extra point on the big mirror in the bathroom. I loved this place and I will totally come back. The breakfast was also great, various choices and located on the 22 second floor, breakfast with a view literally. Rooftop pool can beat all the five-star hotels in bangkok; you will get all the 180 view of bangkok and it was real relaxing. The staff here is super friendly especially Nat, she is helpful and also the manager. 10 out"
"Having a delightful experience at this hotel during the catastrophic events throughout the world , my profession is Hospitality in which I have a Hons degree and 30 years experience , I am most impressed with the front of house management and staff, in particular the lady called Suki and her colleagues who during our stay have served as many of our needs and wants as is possible going that extra mile and taking an interest in our plight , unlike our travel agent and Airline. We will hopefully be back one day and sample the Pool on the Roof üòéüç∫ü§ó"
"Besides from comfortable and spacious rooms, beautiful views and convenient locations,very Good breakfast,ALL the staff too many to mention each and everyone went out of their way to make our stay an exceptional and unforgettable experience...special mention to front desk SUKI  she is so helpful and accommodating with all our request."
"I was assisted by a very kind woman, Nat, at the front desk. She greeted me and was very helpful with my room. This hotel is very beautiful, clean, and a positive environment. The pool roof is beautiful and serene at sunset. Positive experience. Thank you Nat."
"The location is 5 min away (by foot) from a BTS station. The hotel is new and clean, however, the towels look not so clean. Also, the food at breakfast is not that good while the coffee is too strong."
"Good Breakfast and a comfortable place to stay,  well located and walkable to nearest BTS is ARI. The room service and hotel staff were polite and friendly.  The city sky rise view from room is awesome."
"I had stayed in this hotel alone for business trip.  The suite is really big, nice Bangkok view and also comfortable work desk that good for me!  Thank you K.Nut for upgrades the room for me.  She's really nice staff with good service mind! I definitely listed this hotel to the next trip!"
"Nice view, nice equipment and facilities. The price compared with other hotel, it is cheaper but more worth to stay. All the staff are friendly and helpful, specially from front desk, Ta, she is so nine and help us to finish checking in. I will stay here again if I come back to Bangkok ."
I had stayed in this hotel with my family for trip to bangkok. The suite is really big and they will give you full size ginger grass shampoos and shower gel. Infinity pool on the top floor made our days in Bangkok full of joy!!! We had arrived to this hotel around 10am and they let us check in early!! (They will not provide toothbrush and toothpaste)
"thank you Ta ‚ù§Ô∏è for helping us find our forgotten bag in the taxi. You helped us make the calls with a lot of patience. thanks again. The French.  H√¥tel beautiful,pool is very good Pour les fran√ßais c'est un tr√®s belle h√¥tel belle vue sur Bangkok et les chambres sont tr√®s bien üòÅ"
"Great great great! Wonderful attention!! In top roof there is a wonderful infinit swimming pool with wonderful city Views. The gym is the best and most complete I ever been! It is near Chatchu tak night market.It is a little bit far from the main attractions, but there Is a tra√≠n station ( Ari) 5 minutes walk. The room Is spacius with big windows, with great Views. We Will defenetly go back again!!!!"
We were in the quarter ari hotel on February 2020. Staff - Tan and Ta were very polite and helpful. View from our room was amazing. Room was clean and well equipped. After check out we could left our baggage and use shower.
Ta was super helpful with everything. The rooms were very clean and the Pool was super nice. Both the restaurants and Club were very covenant. The building still looks very new from all sizes. When vacationing don‚Äôt for get to stay here.
"We are a small family of 3 and we were kindly upgraded by Tan Ta when we arrived. The view of the whole town in the upper floors is breathtaking, the crew helps and is very nice, the sky pool literally pours on the city, the rooms are large and make immediately yourself at home. We wish we could stay longer!"
"We chose this hotel as we arrived at night at Don Muang airport and departed from Suvarnabhumi the next night. For us it was important to have 24 hrs access/reception and closeness to the BTS. Our room was on 32nd floor and we had a nice view over Bangkok. As we were given an upgrade we had a kitchenette, a living room, a bed room and a balcony. The room was clean and there was a lot of storage space, most probably for business guest staying a little longer than us. We did not have the breakfast, but heard it was good. There was a pool on the roof, which had a nice size and a good view over Bangkok. I like the area of Ari as there are nice (hidden) bars, restaurants and coffee places and it's good to hang out for a day or two. I wouldn't want to stay at the hotel for a whole"
"Modern, spacious and clean room with panoramic views of the surrounding area. Good location - around 10 minutes walk to Ari BTS station, and a further 20 mins to the city by BTS. It was around 30 mins from the airport by taxi. Good WiFi and pleasant breakfast also in a nice room with good views. Staff were always courteous and helpful. Malls and street food not too far away - with spas/restaurants. Some parts of Ari neighborhood are quite hipster with a nice vibe. The hotel is far enough away from the crowds but close enough to the city center."
"The Quarter Ari is a gorgeous property and offers breathtaking views from both the rooms and rooftop swimming pool. My room was quite spacious; it even had a larger-than-expected mini fridge and microwave (perfect for leftovers and stocking up on ice cream from the 7-11 downstairs). I loved the whole modern look and feel, and it reminded me of a lot of hotels in New York City, but much bigger and for only a fraction of the price. Ari is a pretty fun area to explore with lots of cute cafes and restaurants. I really enjoyed the Tell a Story restaurant around the corner that had a local band playing and showed movies outside. I was only at the Quarter Ari for two nights, but would have loved to stay much longer."
"We were there for 3 nights with 2 year old, we liked our stay. Pool and gym areas are very good. Breakfast was ok, we are vegetarians so it was little boring for us. Location is not that good, but luckily there is bts station near. Taxi to city centre took about 30-60min."
"I was recommended this hotel by a friend who visited Thailand the year before me and loved it. I stayed two nights at this hotel: my first and last nights in Thailand (three weeks apart). I couldn't have stayed at a better place to start and finish my trip. The staff is incredibly nice and the hotel facilities are great. The pool is on the smallish side but I haven't had the time to use as I was out and about exploring BKK. The views you get of the city are incredible and the location of the hotel is really good too - about 8-10 minutes walks from the Ari BST station meaning that it is very easy to get to the hotel from any of the two airports by public transport. I had a small issue with my booking where I was sent to the wrong room after check in, it didn't bother me at all"
"The Quarter Hotel is an excellent hotel. Major positive features are the location (only ~8 min walk to Ari BTS station which gets you into downtown Bangkok quickly and easily, but also to Chatuchak Market in 2 stops) the modern quiet rooms, the swimming/fitness facilities, and quality breakfast. I would definitely be happy to stay here again."
"Our family stopped here for a layover and we were not disappointed. Wonderful location (walking distance from Ari stop, take exit 4 and it‚Äôs on the same side of the road). Only 6 minute metro ride to Mo Chit which is walking distance to Chatuchuk market (about 100 meters from Mo Chit stop).  The staff are super friendly and helpful, and the rooftop pool and the gym really nice. Rooms are spacious and large comfortable beds. Breakfast has many options and is nice. Would highly recommend this location as there are many things around and it‚Äôs close to the green line of the BTS."
"The Quarter Hotel Ari is located on the 22-34th floors of an office tower in a residental/business area of Bangkok. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from Ari Skytrain station and 2 stops from the famous Chatuchak Weekend Markets.  The Quarter Hotel has become very well known by Instantgrammers for the amazing views from the 34th floor swimming pool, particularly during sunset. The infinity pool is smallish and only has room for approximately 15 sun loungers so it can be a busy and not very relaxing experience. The Instantgrammers I encountered there were selfish and rude, not considering any other pool users in their quest for the perfect shot. It appeared to be a fashion photo shoot all the time, with swimsuit-clad women in full makeup and preened men strutting and flexing.  I"
This is the first time that I travel Thailand. It is a nice hotel with a convenient location (takes less than 10 mins to BTS Ari station).  The staff at reception named Tata who is very nice and helpful girl with lovely smile and courtesy attitude. We will stay here again next time!  We love the hotel service as well! Thanks all staff in The Quarter Ari.
Clean and quiet rooms with calm yet stylish decor. Doors and drawers are dampened to minimize slamming sounds. Minutes walk from Ari BTS station and connected to the back of the Ari Hills office building. Exceptional help from receptionist named TA.
"I‚Äôve been visiting a few different hotel, the front desk in here so far is the most polite with great services (her name is called Ta). Hotel room is extremely neat and cozy~ Bell boy is really helpful and willing to answer all our needs~"
"Liked staying in this hotel which is close to the BTS station Ari. Comfortable beds and good pillows! The staff were helpful, especially Miss Ta. I really appreciate Ta's smile and her help to solve an issue as I don't speak the local language.  Breakfast was good too. Would stay again."
Our team are currently working on a long time project in Bangkok and have selected Quarter by Ari as a potential hotel to stay in. This was the second week I stayed at Quarter by Ari and again was hugely disappointed.   1) There were building works and constant drilling in the middle of the night from the moment I went into my room at approx 11pm at night. 2) I called the hotel reception several times to fix the issue however there was no answer after several calls.  3) When they finally picked up they sent someone to the room who said they will fix the noise and tell the technicians to stop - this didn‚Äôt happen. 4) Called reception again to complain yet the drilling continued for over an hour after past midnight.   The hotel was doing building works in the middle of the night
"I just stayed here for the first time for take a relax on holiday. The overall service by staff is good especially Miss TA (front desk officer) with good hospitality. The room has good view , new and clean with modern decoration.Breakfast is great in this price. I think I will come again next time."
Has checked in. With great experience.. TA has been great in term of customer service front desk. Excellent. Keep up good work with the right staff. Very friendly environment with great hotel service so far.
"I was suggested this hotel by a friend who lived in the area and was told it was the best to stay at in the area and although I can't make a valid argument for or against that I was overall pleased with the hotel.  Pros: this hotel was kept very clean and the staff I interacted with knew enough of my native language to properly communicate as I'm still a little new to the local language, I never got to the pool or the fitness center but the complimentary drinks were a nice touch and the green voucher incentive was nice to see as well, I saw in the lobby there was an attraction board for tourists who weren't sure what to do or go see. The staff was friendly and didn't hesitate to help me when I asked for it. Cons: There was a little confusion with my booking and I almost wasn't"
We were twice at this hotel and we really love this place. The staff is really helpfull and kind (especially MS SUKI). The Room view from 30nd floor is amazing and great pool at 33nd floor.  The next time in Bangkok - Only in The Quarter Ari !
"Amazing city view, the rooms are modern, clean and spacious. The staffs are helpful and professional, I could early checkin for the third time. The corner rooms are amazing where you can enjoy the complete view."
"Great stay, great staff, especially counter staff, Ms TA. Demonstrate great professionalism. Best of all, greeted with a lovely smile.  Clean and tidy room, even the toilet and bathroom. Working TV and remote.   Easy access to Ari BTS.  Overall, great stay."
"We stayed 5 nights at this property only because of nonrefundable prepayment. The king bed was the most uncomfortable of 5 hotels booked in Thailand on this trip, The lobby was full of travelers sitting around waiting to check in as there was no allowance for anyone to checkin before 2pm. (Their hotel and their policy) Housekeeping was very good and friendly. The rooftop pool and bar on the 33rd floor was nice. The breakfast buffet was overall good, however we never could get an egg cooked to order of our 5 mornings. Strong WIFI and refrigerator and kettle provided. The BTS skytrain Ari station is .6 km walk so be prepared! There are some restaurants and a bar on the lower 2 floors including a Starbucks and 7-11."
"Hotel was clean and the rooftop pool was nice.  The best service you can get. Suki in the reception is one of the sweetest and most service minded persons I‚Äôve ever met. She helped us with different bookings and gave us a lot of good tips. Would love to come back just because of her exceptional service.  - Alex, Andreas and Julia"
"Very nice hotel, but there was something missing. We have requested early check in (we know check in is at 2 but when you pay you can actually have it - and this is not the first time I go in Bangkok). Food was average, breakfast was definitely not worth 450 baht. It was mostly asian and for western jetlagged people fried noodles in the morning is something we are not used to. Reception was okay, not extremely friendly, but kept reminding us what we have to pay. Mini bar had only complimentary water, nothing else. Room was spotless clean and big - we had an apartment overlooking the city and it was very nice. I would recommend it, but for what we've paid you can get a better hotel more central and probably will be cheaper!"
"We have stayed at this hotel first time and with good high quality of service and attention to detail remains.the staff is amazong especially John the Bartender we enjoyed talking to him his speak American englishand and entertaining making good Sex on the beach cocktail & his very polite,and attentive staff,nice talking to you Sir.And the rooms have beem comfortable and immaculate.      The only thing that needs to improvement,in my opinion,is the quality of the food in-site restaurant.this seems to be an issue at quite a few kemptons that oparate the restaurant rather have it run an outside entity.Just my opinion.(although we had room service twice and it was excellent.  Become an inner circle member .great perks."
"Very modern hotel with friendly staff. Very good breakfast buffet-large variety and tasty.it caters for all dietary needs (even vegan). Breakfast room and the infinity pool have amazing views of the city skyline. Rooms were modern, spacious and very clean. It is approximately 7min walk to the bts station Ari."
VIEW IS VERY GOOOOOOOOOOD And clerk(paeng) were very kind  We arrived early but we coukd check in early I will sleep next time also  Really good night  Especially swimming pool was awesome and view also.
Aey and Paeng are nice and good smile cute. They are very helpful upon we check in. Good advice from them. Happy to stay at The quarter Ari.  Good locations near sky train Ari Station. 10 mins walk from Hotel to the station
"Wanderfull hotel in Bangkok. The staff is very kind, in particular Mrs Paeng, available for everything. The breakfast is very good and the roof top swimming pool is very amazing! Best choice in Bangkok!"
"I stayed here for a week. The rate was exceptional! Facilities first class. Room spotless. Beds very comfortable. The infinity pool superb.  Another thing that made this a great stay was the staff. Always smiling, always helpful. We even got on first name terms with Suki from the front desk. She was so helpful and her local knowledge was astonishing!  Nothing but great things to say about this hotel & amazing staff!"
"I have mixed review about this hotel really. Yes its rates are keenly priced. Its signature roof-top pool (and gym) is definitely the wow-factor that‚Äôs on par with some of the others top-rated hotels in Bangkok. But I think that‚Äôs where its attractiveness ends.  ¬†  This might be a new hotel (which is why I chose), but other than the reception lobby, restaurant and pool which looks closely related to the management photos, the core function of a hotel ‚Äì room standard and its services ‚Äì are just extremely basic. The room d√©cor is nothing fancy and yet it‚Äôs also of poor quality ‚Äì it certainly feels more hostel than hotel and hence its competitive rate reflects. We booked a ‚Äúpremier suite‚Äù which is nothing too premier except it comes with a living room and on top floor with good"
"Breakfast is very good. View is good. Location is good. Near the Ari station. First floor seveneleven, starbucks is so convience to me. very clean. Microwave, refregiater, airconditioner, bigsize television... and so on....  Good good good."
"Hotel with good wiev. Pool is really nice at the 33 floor. Breakfast was really nice and variety. There is also restaurants, Cafeterias and grocery store at downstairs. Also water maker, fridge and safedoposit box at the room. Bathrobe would be nice.   Only down side was when we went to the restaurant at the night and hade to wait over and hour to get food. There was only 6 people table before us. Staff didnt say anything for the long wait. Would go somewhere else if we knew that had wait so long time to get one food."
"Very good hotel. I would have given higher rating if breakfast would have been included. Very spacious room (I had a king suite), very clean, modern bathroom and very clean as well. Rooftop pool is good and has a great view. The gym is quite well equipped. The bar is quite expensive, but that's what you can expect in a hotel like this. Location is ok, ten minutes walk from the BTS skytrain station. At the ground floor of the hotel building there is a Starbucks and a 7 eleven supermarket; very convenient."
"A very convenient, inexpensive, modern and clean hotel with great facilities including a rooftop infinity pool, bar and adjoining gym and bar/ restaurant serving superb fare by friendly staff. It‚Äôs 33 floors high so the 360-views over Bangkok are superb. We had an en-suite bathroom and shower plus a spare bedroom and separate shower, a kitchen with hobs, microwave and proper fridge, two cool TVs with many channels, large lounge and bedrooms with very comfortable beds. Breakfast was delightful and open from 6.30 to 10.30am. Outside there were plenty of shops. Brilliant value for money and very family friendly. Youngsters would adore the pool and choice of food and drink and adults would appreciate the hospitality, relatively low cost and other amenities, including easy access to"
Arrived.  Smooth check in by friendly staff.  Room was spotless and bed very comfortable.   The infinity pool was amazing as were the views.   Breakfast was buffet style with plenty of variety and again amazing views.  Concierge organised taxi to airport and helped with luggage.  I understand this is their job however staff were particularly helpful and patient.  Would stay again.
"I was stay for 1 night befor flying back to Australia, after get off from BTS train at Ari station I was walk to the hotel under a very hot weather the walking was take me more than 8 minutes, I was very wet and hot and I realy want to drink a cold water and need to check in have a shower.  but I have to waite untill 2pm to check in, the front staff were very slowly to do your doccuments I was stand at the front counter with my wet pace and wet my shrit no any welcome cold drink, after finished documents and pay for the room they told me the check in time at 2 pm then I have to leave my bags at the hotel and come back 2pm. the hotel room very clean, bed very comfortable but so many chinese tourise I am not sure will be back to this hotel again in Bangkok so many hotels to stay"
"The worst hotel I ever stayed in. After arrival no hot water, bathroom full of hair, licking air condition, infinity pool glass completely dirty you can‚Äôt see through. During our stay we needed to contact the hotel but on the phone number given on web page was someone‚Äôs personal phone so we couldn‚Äôt reach the hotel. Management don‚Äôt care, we got complementary dinner as apology and when we went to have a dinner from a list of 50 foods only 10 available. For this amount of money definitely not worth to stay and we really don‚Äôt recommend. The hotel actually ruined our last days spent in Thailand."
"Stayed for 2 nights.  Hotel on paper is fantastic but management is clearly not up to the job.  The whole hotel had no hot water for the complete day.  What made it frustrating was the complete lack of communication and lack of management staff on site to deal with such a major issue.  The manager Ms Tommy was nowhere to be seen after numerous requests.  Finally we were told she had gone to head office for a meeting leaving the poor front desk staff to deal with the problems!  There wasn't one manager available to make or take any decisions, we found this very strange.  A reputable hotel would have at least contacted each guest and even offered some kind of compensation even if it's a free drink.  The manager never did contact us before we checked out and I doubt she spoke to"
