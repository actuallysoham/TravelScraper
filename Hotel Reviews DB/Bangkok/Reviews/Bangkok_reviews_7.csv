"Good location, best service, better than manyplace of 4 stars hotel other, thai restaurant very delicious and affordable to dinner. Room so very clean and comfort. Hotel staffs good at service mind and cosy with me, i will refer to many friends and come back again"
"We stayed here for 14 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We got a fabulous rate for a 2 bedroom suite that was a perfect size for our family of 4. The hotel is new and super clean. We opted for daily breakfast which is delivered to your room Mon-Fri and then available buffet-style in the restaurant on the 2nd floor on weekends. It‚Äôs great breakfast and worth the price and convenience. The pool and bar on the 18th floor is awesome as well.  The hotel is right next to a 7/11 which was super convenient for snacks for our kids. It is also conveniently located within walking distance from Mercuryville, Central World, Siam Paragon shopping centers as well as Lumphini Park and Erawan Shrine.   The staff was incredibly sweet and accommodating, especially Naphat, who was always"
"I've been here twice for my dinner. For the first time I tried their Thai food which are roasted chicken with fried rice and deep fried chicken wings. They were both great, especially their roasted chicken. It was marinated nicely with Thai herbs ang got a hint of lemongrass. For the second time, I tried their dried tomato and shrimp pasta and pizza, which were also palatable. The prices are reasonable. Khun Tan, June, and Nueng are the staff there. They are very helpful and attentive. If you're looking for a place for dining, this restaurant is highly recommended."
very enjoyable. My second time here. Still good as new. less than 5 mins walk from BTS Chidlom. Thai food at Treat is to die for. All menus are so authentic and distinctive. Signature dessert is  what you have to order to finish your dinner on a good note
"This‚Äôs my first time at Sindhorn Midtown Bangkok and it‚Äôs was starting well when k.Focus and K.Ma-now greeted me with a smile and very friendly helpful attitude.  Staff is so important, They really make the difference and can make/breaks your stay.  K.Focus and K.Ma-now made it !!   Overall a very good Tr.eat with staff as the biggest+"

"We recently stayed for one night as I wanted to take the kids to Harborland and the hotel was offering a promotion with free entry, along with room upgrade, early check in/ late check out and free meal for kids. It was a good promotion for the price. We had a two bedroom corner suite on the same floor as the pool which was very convenient. Being relatively new, the hotel is clean and modern with a stylish pool/ bar area. Breakfast was good, if a little limited, but the lunch we had was a little disappointing. Another downside was they only issued one room key and this stopped working a couple of hours before check out. It was quickly resolved, but not ideal when you‚Äôre trying to get your kids showered and changed after swimming,  Staff were friendly and helpful. We‚Äôd definitely"
The food was great with the reasonable price but even greater with the nice service from N.Moo at  the pool bar. He was friendly and gave all needed info. We really enjoy the experience there; will surely come back. Thx!
The brand-new hotel place in The middle of town. I visit Treat by Saneh Jaan by lunch time. The taste of food was good. Do not miss Phad Thai!!! Staff was nice and good service.  Special thank to Khun Ake-Suwit gave a tour to see hotel facilities.   I like the idea to put Sharp air purify as hotel standard for every rooms. This is the must for the world famous hotel.
"My family and I spent one night at Sindhorn Midtown Hotel on February 26,2021 to celebrate my niece‚Äôs birthday. The hotel staffs made it as a very special day with all complimentary stuffs and the decorations. All rooms were nice and clean. There was also the great turndown by Khun Sorawit,  room attendant. It‚Äôs my second time here and I‚Äôll come back again for sure."

Comfort accommodation with Harbourland next door is great for the family with kids. Thai food at Tr.eat is superb with great service from khun Fern. Don‚Äôt miss authentic thai dessert ‚ÄúSom-chun‚Äù. The location is also perfect for urban hanging around.
The service is good especially from K.Au and K.Tan who are very attentive. The ambience is cozy. Most of the dish are delicious but some are too salty. Dessert is good but too less of choice. Anyway the price is reasonable.
New hotel located on Langsuan Rd. which close to BTS Chidlom Station. I really love the location! There are many restaurants nearby and 7-11 is right in front of the hotel. Spacious room with cozy and modern interior. All staffs were nice and friendly.
"Great hotel with reasonable price.  I've a wonderful stay with my family.  All staff have been helpful, friendly especially Khun Focus at Front office. He has been helpful, cheerful for us throughout the stay. We also had smooth checkout by Khun Manao. Thank you! üòÄ"
The quality of the room is nice considering the price. The pool area is slightly overcrowded. The reservation for the pool use should be for day bed not the pool. The service is confusing at time (we tried to order wine for in room dining) but the operator said it‚Äôs impossible. The service however was elevated by. K Tam (bellman) who was very hospitable.
"I am currently in long stay status at Sindhorn midtown. I liked the facilities here, the gym is big and plenty of machines, the horizon pool is clean w/ view from the 19F. I also liked the house keeping everyday which keeps my unit clean & neat. Lastly, they have nice staffs- very friendly & accommodating. Special mention to kun Naphat, one of the staff who helps me a lot."
"Restaurant is Great decor with delicious food. We love Somchun, thai dessert with fresh taste. Also lovely, warm welcome and wonderful services from staff (K.Piamluck, K.Fern and every staff here) My team and my business partner are pleasure here üòä"
"I had dinner with my friends at Tr. eat. The food was nice as well as the atmosphere. The staffs and manager were also very attentive and helpful, especially K‚ÄôAu Manager, K‚ÄôPloy, K‚ÄôPan, K‚ÄôBoom and K‚ÄôTitle. Definitely,  recommended for the special occasion."
"I've booked a Vday package for a very last minute as I want to celebrate my vday with my husband being away from other ppl to keep me safe. This package is everything we're looking for; includeed all meals serving at our room. For dinner, it's 4 course dinner set with sparking wine to celebrate privately. For breakfast, we can choose the options from the hotel. All meals are really nice esp. the dinner, we love it so bad!   Moreover, the location is very convenice in the heart of BKK with clam surrounding and there's 7/11 just in front the hotel.  The room's very nice and clean. My room type's a suit with a little kitchen, medium sized fridge, dinning table and living area. These are what we've looking for our great staycation for our social distancing vday."
"Really appreciate the service provided by all hotel associates, since step in the lobby. Special thanks for Khun Napat, Bellman who had assisted when I was waiting for my friend for Dinner and served  me a superb welcome drink!. Thank you to Khun Manao, Receptionist who has a welcome smile and give me a really nice information and recommendation. Dinner was really nice and all F&B staffs were really friendly too."
Need to say ‚ÄúWoW‚Äù very appreciated the service here especially K Oh at the reception i feel her smile even under the mask. Welcome drink was offer while i waiting for my friend at the lobby. i will come back again for sure and thank you the staff at the restaurant. The food is really good. Welcome drink is real nice.
I visited the hotel with my friends. Tomyum welcome drink was served by Khun Napat was delicious. People in the lobby were friendly and welcoming every time we passed by. Swimming pool on 18th floor was so great. You can enjoy Bangkok city view when you spend time in the pool.
"Very convenient location next to many shopping malls, central Chidlom vella .Clean spacious room. Excellent very helpful and friendly staffs. Delicious Thai food. There‚Äôs a 7-11 just right infront of the hotel"
I booked a hotel because I have seen the picture with the view and the pool in the roof top which is so amazing. The room was great and you can enjoy the view of BKK city. Though the room has offered you all the facilities that you might need in the other hand for toiletries they couldn't provide you toothpaste and toothbrush as the room is look like 5 star to me. However the rest in the room was nice very neat and clean. I ordered a room service for my dinner and that's so tasty as well. And you can walk to BTS only 5 minutes if you want to explore the city. I would definitely come back again and I have good time there.
"Our special dinner at Tr.eat, good food and details added. Chef made one set as vegetarian as per request, it came so good and delicious. Services also fantastic, thanks Au and Tan. Will be back again."
"Dear. Sindhorn Midtown,  First time of my stay at your hotel. I'm very impressed, since I call to book dinner v-day. Your team is very helpful.

"This is my second time to stay. I choose this hotel again as I loved their staff service and also their restaurant, all menu from Tr.EAT was delicious and the price not too expensive when had compare with another Thai restaurant in another hotel.  I got 2 beds room suite, we loved all decorations inside the room, big sofa, pantry area and also have air purifier setup inside living room, this is the best for me as I am allergic and sensitive with PM2.5  Back to hotel facilities, I loved to visit panoramic outdoor pool to enjoy unlimited drink package at pool bar, their have created delicious cocktail and food for us.

Nice bar with sorted cocktails rum based. And Savory cocktail was worth for trying. Pim the bartender quite nice. I would took another chance to back here. And the location wasn't far from sky train. BTW I can't upload the photos.
"Food is so nice, Thai food and spaghetti were really great! the price is reasonable as well. The service are very wonderful! especially K.Nueng, she served me so well!  Thank you for this great dinner and excellent atmosphere."
"We stayed Sindhorn Mitrtown for 1 night, we chose to have dinner at Rhumba at 1st floor beside lobby, the atmosphere of the restaurant is very comfortable, friendly, the staff who take care of us name Khun Fern can advise us on the menu to celebrate our Christmas tonight.  Khun James, the bartender who selects the menu that is suitable for our food.  Excellent advice  My boyfriend is very satisfied.  The menu are reasonably priced with quality. We will back again for sure."
"Perfectly located. Helpful and friendly staff. Thank you to Front team Khun Best, Nan, Naphat and Tam. Also an excellent breakfast and dinner. We will definetely come back with friends and I would highly recommend this hotel."
"Went to Rhumba with the family for dinner last night. The Thai food served in this hotel just off Langsuan Road is an upscale version of street food without the exorbitant prices. Choices are good without being overwhelming.   We ordered from the Rhumba menu as well as Thai food from Treats by Saneh Jan and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner.   During dinner,my teenage son cut his finger on his braces and when we asked for a plaster from the staff, 4 of them came over with a fully stocked first aid kit to check if he was ok üôÇ.   I was commend the caring attitude of Au, Cherry, Manow and Naphat.   Will definitely be back!"
"Visited for the third time here, every time we are so happy with how staffs treated us and made we feel so entertained with their charisma, good services and impressive cocktails This time our experience were blessed by talented Oam, Ferm and Pim. Thank you and You will keep seeing us drunk and laughing like madmen. :)"
"This restaurant was very good. The food tasted good. Our favorite was fried shrimp balls and fried fish cakes.  The service was excellent.  K. Tan, our waiter, was very friendly.  üëç A place to recommend!"
The ambiance of this restaurant is quite nice and I‚Äôm satisfied with their services as well as the taste of food. The place was not busy even on the Saturday afternoon. Very reasonable price in my opinion but still too less options for food/dessert.  ‡∏ó‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏¢
"Rooms, food, haborlandfor kids, safety, clean, all are excellent, I will come again.  Convenient transportation in the middle of the city, close to tourist attractions and shopping. Highly recommended for families with children."
A very good place go try authentic Thai from Michelin-starred team ‚ÄòSaneh Jahn‚Äô. stir-fried Sanoh w grass noodle n fermented pork is one of the dish u cant miss. Also Monn Curry and Pomelo salad are really worth trying.
Great atmosphere and service. Clean and quiet place. The best choice at Langsuan with a reasonable price. They have a spectacular view at rooftop pool. Convenient for going out around Bangkok. You should try once!
"Perfect infinity view pool (lovely floating bean bag) and also amazing interior designed by the value furniture. Impressed service from every staff, especially K'Focus and K'Gie. Hope to come back again. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Without doubt one of the favorite hotels I stayed during my time in BKK! Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff. The staff was extremely friendly, the check in/out time is very flexible under our request!   And I have to mention about the staff name ‚ÄúNaphat‚Äù, who is such a warm personality and highly motivated guide (recommendable!). He helped us to open the shortcut door again and again. It saved so much treasure time for us during the stay epically with baby kid.   The hotel atmosphere is so special that it really felt like home to me. All respect for the staff who have done a great job here; a true sample of excellent hospitality!"
"A derivative of One MICHELIN Star traditional Thai fine dining, Saneh Jaan. This Tr. EAT restaurant made us an impressive welcome with spacious high ceiling space located at Sindhorn Midtown Hotel, right on Lungsuen Road.  ‚ÄúSaneh Jaan‚Äù is famous for first-class materials from all across Thailand  for food preparation and I hope this Tr. Eat restaurant keep the same strategy because the food taste good. (I didn't have time to find information about this material thing while we were there).  We were a big party of 60, 30 kids and 30 adults, that well seated (kept) in one section of the restaurant and everyone loved what we ordered. We only selected a la carte menu and some stater dishes,  Pad Thai goong sod, Tung tong Sai gai, but now thinking about coming back to try other main"
"I live in Bangkok but wanted a change of scenery and decided to book 3 nights at this hotel. I'm not sure where to start - everything from beginning to end was pretty amazing - Room (Urban Premier): minimal design but makes you feel at home. Perfect for WFH: great wifi, usb plugs, big enough desk Super comfy bed, smart TV and there are many amenities you can ask for. - Facilities: the infinity pool itself is quite worth the stay and offers a 180 degree view of Bangkok. It feels quite amazing to witness the hustle and bustle from your sunbed. Haven't used the gym but it shares the same view as the pool - Location: it's right in the middle of Bangkok yet feels so quiet and relaxing. Chidlom BTS is a 5 min walk, Lumpini park a 10 min walk. Around the hotel you have plenty of"
"I am quite impressed with attentive yet friendly staffs at this hotel, I mean everyone I ran into seemed helpful and have beautiful smile in their face. On top of that, the location is right in the middle of Bangkok on more tranquil side however easily access to both public transportation and by your own car. The hotel is well-decorated (love the design) clean and full with facilities I need. Thank you for your great service.   Would love to come back for another stay."

"First of all I like to mention the friendly, helpful and capable staff, with on top of our list reception manager Priauw. But all the other staff members we met during our 8 night stay, did their utmost to make our stay a pleasant one. The modern and clean hotel, with facilities like a swimming pool, fitness centre, sauna, pool bar, lounge bar, restaurant is situated on a location not far from for exemple Lumpini Park, the Erawan Shrine, Sindhorn Village with some nice restaurants and a very good supermarket underground, many malls like Central Chidlom, Central Embassy, Gaysorn Village, Central World, Sian Discovery, Siam Center, Siam Century, Siam Paragon, the Platinum clothes mall and the good old MBK. They are all in walking distance from the hotel or not more then one"
"+ Love the location as it's very closed to my workplace and my kids school.  + Love the cleanliness and the newness of the hotel. + Love the view at the sky pool.  + Love the decoration of the lobby, the 2nd fl.restaurant and the 18th floor rooms' style. + Love the hotel amenities in the bathroom; The shampoo, conditioner and bath products are unexpectedly very good.  > Bedsheet softness could be optimised. > Bathtub water leak when using shower (in the 2 br type) should be reviewed."
"If anyone is looking for the staycation or long stay in Bangkok I highly recommend Sindhorn midtown hotel.  The location is very near to the BTS and siam. The room is very modern and comfortable, feel like we are at home.  We are so enjoy and happy to stay in this hotel, even one night, but not the last time to come here. Just want to say thank you so much to all the staffs for taking care of us."
"The staff are wonderful. Very knowledgeable and helpful. Particularly Cookie, Pui, Fern, Oatto, Pim,James,Ohm, Uma, Tai.  I know I used the word particularly, but everybody was fantastic. I would definitely return here frequently."
"Very good value hotel in a great location in BKK. What really makes it, is the staff!! They shine bright, like the glass entrance doors that are so clean I have seen people walk straight into them on both visits to this lovely hotel! The modern rooms are very comfortable and stylish with all areas maintained to a 5 star standard. Special thanks to the reception staff and the assistant restaurant manager, actually everyone!!  I wouldn't imagine this hotel need worry about having a marketing department providing they look after and keep the staff they have!"

After they reopen again during Covid situations, I have good experience at this hotel, firstly I would love to say thank you Khun Note from sale department as she is the person who take care my reservation and make my dream staycation at this hotel.

"It‚Äôs a newly opened hotel in Langsuan area. The location is considered close to restaurants and transportation (BTS Chidlom).  Hotel is modern. Bar is good but not so many selections.  Upon check-in the room, we found the room had problem with the air-conditioned (really hot) right at the spot by which we could not change the room temperature then we called the front desk. Later (5-10 mins), they sent someone to fix the issue which turned out that there were a problem with the wire as it was teared out of the digital panel of air-conditioned.  So we came down just to see how long it took to finish fixing. We sat for a while then asked the front team to change the room for us.  Honestly, other hotels would have offered to change to room right at the moment the guest tell them"
"Very good Thai taste, unfortunately there are not many selections.  The waiter and waitress ( Khun Jib and Khun Tan ) are very helpful and kind.  Another nice and cosy place to dine...Thank you very much."

"After dealing with a car accident, our plan to visit Harborland was delayed. Three small children were quite upset and hungry. Luckily we bumped into Khun Aoe a Sindhorn-Midtown staff who was walking around the area. She was very helpful and suggested us that the hotel provided kids‚Äô menus and could be delivered for us at Harborland. The meal was at reasonable price, tasty and came quickly by Khun Aungsunee(mention on the receipt)"
