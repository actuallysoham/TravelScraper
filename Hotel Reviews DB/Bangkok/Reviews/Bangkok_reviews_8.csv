"One of the most scenic rooftops in Bangkok is Vertigo, the place I choose for my birthday. The food is good, the view is incredibly beautiful, especially for sunset, moreover, the service is excellent, the staff, named Lek, treated us very well not only presenting the food but also taking us the photo. This place will be recommended to my beloved ones."
I stayed in a serenity club room with stunning river and city views on the 55th floor (thanks for the room upgrade!). I‚Äôm impressed by the services. All staffs were friendly and helpful. The pool and the gym are quite small but nice. The hotel has an excellent rooftop bar. The overall experience was absolutely amazing.
Mr.Lek was very helpful while we were dining. Best place to pick for special occasions. Great view. Good food quality. Luxury but low key. Classy is the definition. I recommend BKK Mojito for a starter.
We came here to celebrate my birthday and the experience was amazing. Although it wasn‚Äôt our first time here but the service was exceptionally well today especially with Khun Lek as our waiter. He took great care of us to make the night special. The food was very delicious and overall would really recommend for any occasions to come.
"great rooftop view in bkk ... dim light is perfect time for come with friend or your honey.. food so yummy!! Verity ! Nua toon lamyai , Beef steak and verity dessert! good service -K.Lak & K. Pear. üòä"
"We did a quick staycation at the Banyan Tree, and stayed in one of their club suites. There's a lot of positive things to say about this hotel. First, the location on Sathorn road makes it pretty accessible to things. The sheer size of the hotel, at over 60 stories is pretty impressive. And the rooftop bars and restaurants are really hard to beat. The views from the rooms, and from the rooftop venues is really quite exceptional.   Overall the experience here is good. You shouldn't be disappointed with a stay here. The hotel interiors are beginning to look a little dated, though. Not because they are worn out, but just because design trends have changed, and newer hotels reflect those changes."
"No words can describe how good my experience was on the Saffron cruise by Banyan tree and the level of detail and organisation from Jim who helped me to organise a surprise engagement proposal to my girlfriend (now Fianc√©, she did say yes!)   Jim organised everything for me, where the best seats were for the proposal (table 61 upstairs, on the top deck in front of the beautiful Wat Arun), arranging a bottle of champagne, Flowers and getting a book on the boat secretly so that my Fianc√© would not know. From the moment we arrived on the boat the service was exceptional from our waiter First who was amazing from the moment we got on to the moment we left the cruise, we was escorted to our reserved table for a pre drink overlooking icon Siam and all the beautiful places along the"
"Since the 1st step to the bar ,awesome panoramic view skyline of Bangkok including friendly staffs especially K‚ÄôLek always take care of us during fantastic dinner moreover he always suggest the menu  that makes me so impressed. Well done!!!come back again for sure!"
"We‚Äôve spent 3 days 2 nights here.   We really appreciated the service from Khun Chay of Vertigo sky bar so much. He is very talented in service. He provided us with a great recommendation of food and beverage choice. Thank you Khun Chay for making our lovely dinner go beyond excellent.  Apart of Khun Chay‚Äôs service, we have got room 1701 which really disappointed on the first night. Below points are what we found.  1.We found pieces of broken glass in the cooler.  2.The steam room couldn‚Äôt be use.  3.The bathtub drainage was malfunction. 4.Safe box was not working."
"Well service and taking care of us especially K.Lek. He gives a great service mind and takes the best photo of us as well. Furthermore, I love the every menu course esp Australian beef, Crispy duck salad. We'll back again in the next time for sure.  : D"
"We have a chance to dinner at Saffron cruise. The meal was soooooo good, if you love Thai food and a good Bangkok river view this is it.  K. Banyat and K.Lek treat us very well!!  The bangkok night view is perfect.  We will come back again for sure."
The Sky bar on the 61st floor is an absolute must see and unforgettable! Great atmosphere! Food and drinks were superb. I would like to give a special thanks to Khun Jackie (Concierge). You made my experience memorable. I highly recommend this place and I will definitely return!
"I had such a fantastic moment there. I and my boyfriend stayed there for a night to celebrate my belated birthday. I got a spacious one bed suite with a very nice view of Satorn area. With all that, million thanks to Jacky at concierge  who took care of us perfectly when we arrived. He also had a perfect recommendation for a nice  place for dinner. That was one of the best experience I‚Äôve ever had. ‚Äò‚Äô Impressive‚Äô‚Äô"
"My boyfriend and I went there for celebrate my birthday and it was such a good moment. We got one bedroom suite , the room was so clean and the bed is so comfy. The service was so perfect, especially Thank you the staff who took care us, Jacky, he provided a great service and information, went the extra mile and made sure that our stay was great. We were so impressed."
"Excellent structure, all the comforts of a large hotel, exceptional services from 24-hour cuisine, to wellness services, and then ending up in an extraordinary room.  The upper floors are a show, with the bar and restaurant perhaps a little expensive, but it depends on the height."
"I have planned to surprise my boss anniversary but I cant be there to organize things.  Surprisingly, I‚Äôve got a super handful guest service, Nong Kanom Kheng. It‚Äôs really impressive to get a helpful staff without any excuse or condition and make it happen.  Thank you and really wanna get her a compliment."
"The restaurant and bar is absolutely excellent place  both for service and location. The view is breathtaking, you can enjoy the sunset here and Bangkok lights at night. Food and drink is perfect. And the staff team is really good at their job. We had ‚ÄúLek‚Äù at our table and he was really amazing on his work. His service was beyond our expectations. He is a nice, friendly and also professional. Highly recommended for everyone!!!!"
"Huge and luxury hotel with nice garden. So calm and quite place for staycation. Location is awesome, staff are so helpful and friendly. Ms. June (FO) welcoming me with smile and good hospitality. The staff sent me cute chocolate for my birthday, it was delicious. Breakfast was great, yummy bread and nice service from Ms. Aom (resto staff for breakfast) sorry if im wrongly written the name. It was memorable birthday staycation for me. Tq for all the hospitality . Sure will come back soon."
"I stayed 1 night for romantic staycation with my partner. We are impressed by the view in our room facing caopraya river.   The bathtube is so cozy, completed with candle plus orchid petals with great view.  Me and my partner was impressed with how delicious and complete menu during breakfast with cozy sitting place next to the garden pool with beatiful handmade waterfall.   Thanks for khun punnasiri and khun eve in reservation who constantively help all my email inquiry during booking and khun june for her professional attitude always taking care our needs and providing details information during stays. they are true hotelier.  I will definitely come back again soon and recommend this hotel to my colluages for every staycation"

Very nice atmosphere with best service from staff N‚Äô first . I was impressed with many photos he shot for us and he gave full information about everything in the menu and the scenery we asked with very polite manner in his work .
The roof top bar and restaurant alone merit 5 stars at this iconic hotel but that aside its simply devine.  We booked a hotel car to take us from a rather long and disappointing KLM flight. The driver was wonderful and drove beautifully in his 7 series BMW.  Whisked staright to our suite where check in was carried out in seconds.  Jet lag ensued so we had the most wonderful room service.  Pool area is a little small but very neat and tidy and did not get too busy.  Great gymn with all the machines required.  Breakfast is simply stunning with such a wide variety of international and traditional Thai food.  We ate in Saffron twice but could have eaten there every night.  We did have reservations for Vertigo which were cancelled due to high winds.  All in all we simply cannot

"Very first thing i wish very much specifially  to is that procedure of protection covid 19 for all the peoples who was getting into the hotel which is solid performance. From the main door to the lobby i have been warmly greeted by Khun Jacky ( Chief Concierge ) as well as friendliness of entire staffs at front desk were wonderful, smile and charming. Food & Beverage at vertigo was exceptional , absolutely fantastic delicious. Also team members on the roof top were very helpful, prompt response and move fast for serving.  Well done to you all Banyan Tree. Highly recommend & definitely return."
On last minute trip to celebrate my girlfriend birthday. I check with the guest service if its possible to arrange a birthday cake delivered on midnight despite a last minute request (i request this on 8pm)  Ms. Chopaka from guest service is very attentive and able to arrange it for us. She give me a confirmation that she can arrange and have it delivered to my room on midnight. We really really appreciate her quick action and very happy with the arrangement!!
"We bought one day trip, included visiting temples, set lunch menu, cruise experience and a night at Banyan Tree.  Really impressed from excellence service, no doubt why this package is your top-selling !!"
"Banyan Tree Bangkok used to be on the top list of the hotels in Bangkok... not anymore!  We book the promotion room and all you can eat dinner at vertigo.  Room : the room and the hotel are in bad condition (furniture, the tap of the shower was broken, the button of a light was broken too). The bed was good at least  The bath soap was empty and the amenities look so cheap We asked for ice cub. They bring us a ice container with 3 kg of cubs :-) ... see photo The bedroom doesn‚Äôt have window!!! Only the living room has a window...  Dinner at vertigo : MY MAIN DISAPPOINTMENT! Some dishes were cold (Australian steak, french fries), the portions were ridiculously small (at least, you can order many time the same dish as it is ‚Äúall you can eat‚Äù concept. The service was not good, not"
"We booked this hotel at the last minute due to what we thought was a very competitive price for a 5 star hotel.   Alas, having just stayed at the new Marriott Marquis on Sukhumvit Soi 22 and the Marriott  in Hua Hin, we realised how spoiled we had been in those new and fresh hotels.  The Banyan Tree is set back off what is a very busy road, with not much close by.  It is surrounded by high rise office blocks, so not a particularly convenient or interesting location.  When driving into the hotel, you have to go behind the building that is on the road. When you get to the drop off area, it is very small, un-inviting and with no doorman waiting outside. At first, we thought we had inadvertently arrived at the service entrance to the hotel.  The doorman, singular, was ok but not"
It was a comfortable stay and the bed was so soft and i slept like a baby. Loved using the bathtub as well. Exceptional view but too much pollution in BKK now. Had the buffet dimsum in Baiyun for dinner and the service was excellent.
"I have visited this place for the first time and I really appreciated this hotel and restaurant. All staffs were so nice, helpful, and friendly. I was staying in 1 bedroom suite room. A huge room with 180 degree view from a bathtub. My dinner was so memorable. Beautiful view, good food, and wonderful staff. The one who took care of me named K.Lek he was so nice and impressive."
"We had great time in Saffron cruise from Banyan tree. Cruise itself is spectacular with outdoor bar on deck offering us beautiful view of Bangkok riverside, and  indoor dining area which offers a luxurious ambiance of Banyan tree on board.   Service was also top notched. Khun First was looking after us whole night from seating us to sending us off. Many thanks to make our night perfect!  We have already recommended this to friends, and for us, we will definitely plan to be there again soon."
"This is my first time staying at Banyan Tree Bangkok. I really feel the warm & family kinds of treatment. Everyone treated me with care & love.  The Airport Representative K. Thun is very friendly. After met me at arrival hall, he brought me to the limousine. Along the way, he tried to engage with me by starting small talk & provided me necessary info. He even asked me if I would like to use washroom before depart from airport as the journey will take approx 40mins to hotel. So caring üòä Next, I met K. Suthep, the limo driver. Another guy with a warm smile (even covered with mask) make me feel at ease. He checked on me to ensure that my whole journey is comfortable. He is very knowledgeable even just joined the company for 6 months.  The whole journey is flawless. When I reach"
We decided to spend a week over Xmas and the NY at the resort. Wonderfully managed as always and they balanced the need for COVID safety with their renowned customer care. We stayed in the new Serenity Pool villas which are excellent and a short bike ride or walk to the lobby. First time back for a while and we will be back soon! Thank you Banyan Tree Phuket!

"I chose to have my birthday's dinner at Saffron Cruise, I would say that I didn't make a wrong decision. I am very impressed with my first time having dinner cruise, the food in  3-courses is tasty, and the surprised birthday little dark chocolate mousse cake is unbelievable and unforgettable because it is so soft and delicacy so it leads me to make special order of this dark chocolate mousse on my wedding anniversary when stayed at this hotel. The service was so great, it was really beyond my expectation, male staff who had taken my photos during our dinner is professional in photoshoot, also other staffs who have taken my photos when I was on the moon deck. Especially service from Khun Fern and Khun Jack is exceptional, they have very service mind, Khun Fern has escorted me"
"I have a dinner at saffron cruise, the service is very good (n‚Äôfirst take care us) , he very nice and polite. The food had 3 course and taste is not wow, we wait a quite long for food. Atmosphere and decoration is great."
I stayed for five days in this magnificent hotel.  It all begins with the welcome when they bring you a very fragrant flower garland.  The room is spacious clean and the staff is really very kind and at every step they make you a bow.  There is a splendid restaurant on the top floor of the hotel.  The restaurant is open air and has a truly unique view

"We both have travelled a lot and have stayed at the Banyan Tree many years ago. Not a lot has changed in decoration and style. We booked a suite as it was a good promotion but the price is not the most important part for us, as that would be the experience and good service. (Days, weeks, months or years later people have forgotten about the price but the good memories or bad have not been forgotten)  Lobby was ok (not a grand style) and looked fine but it was not cozy. We checked in and were given 2 keys and pointed to the elevators. We did not had many bags but the bell man sorted our bags out. He did not enter the room but that was ok. We were very disappointment by the room. The bedroom had NO WINDOW and was dark. The room was very cold and the colors in the room were not"

Mr.Nueng from frontdesk provided a fast check-in process. Check-out was also smooth.  My original purpose was to try their new Serenity Club Room, but it appears that they closed down some high floors during weekdays, so they put me in 2-bedroom suite which is located on lower floors instead. The suite was very spacious. It may be worth the upgrade, but it contradicts my original purpose.  The suite was clean, but I spotted stain on carpet, sofa and chairs.

"This was our first stay in a Banyan Tree Hotel and quite frankly blew us away. From check-in to check-out we were impressed again and again. We were very surprised and thankful to receive a room upgrade and nothing could have prepared us for the moment we opened the door of the room, it was breathtaking. Thank you to the front desk - you gave us a lifelong everlasting memory. Our stay was relatively short so we couldn't sample all the hotel has to offer (and didn't want to leave our delightful room) however we did take a trip to the rooftop Moon Bar and it really is a 'must do' as the views and the atmosphere were truly amazing.  It would be difficult to find fault with any aspect of our stay, so suffice to say we were extremely impressed with the staff, the room, the location"
I was here with my family and it was my first experiencing dining on cruise. I was impressed by the warm welcoming of the crew and the friendly and exceptional service from ‚ÄúN‚ÄôFirst‚Äù. Thank you for making the night amazing and memorable. Shout out to ‚ÄúN‚ÄôFirst‚Äù üòÅüëçüèª
"We have always been a big fan of the Banyan Tree Bangkok. Our experience as same as what we‚Äôve experienced before COVID-19.  The hotel has a great hygiene system during this time.  The food, the service, the facilities, the rooms, everything about this property is PERFECT. (apart from club lounge 19th floor have closed during this COVID era)  Every little detail is taken care off, anything you need is available for you. Special thanks to Khun Ying (Room Director) whom manage all service during our stay (4 nights) even she is still working aboard.  Rooms - Spectacular view from the room on 57th floor (city view)   Dining ‚Äì Bai Yun is the five star Chinese roof top in Bangkok. Staff always ensure we had the best experiences. JUST AMAZING!!!  Concierge - always available to make"
"The Banyan Tree is one of the best Hotels to stay in Bangkok. Our stay was truly amazing! Beautiful and clean rooms , delicous food with a great variety and a breathtaking view. But by far the best was the staff! Well trained, friendly and truly outstandig. We can truly call the Banyan Tree Bangkok a home."
"The hotel is old but well maintained. The staffs service is topnotch. Some other 5 stars hotel can be quite tight with customers requests, but not year. We have got plenty of tea/coffee/fresh milk etc. Breakfast is also amazing, in fact all the meals as they used high quality of ingredients. The room is large and sparkly clean. Special thanks to N Sugar who made my checkin so smooth. 10 10 10!"
"The Banyan tree hotel is an excellent Hotel that made us feel very secured in these trying times. We needed a get away after many months of lock down as we were rather cautious of traveling. However the hotel went above and beyond to make us extremely comfortable not only due to their COVID19 management but also the Chief Concierge Mr. Jackie that we had the utmost pleasure to converse with during our stay. He gave us the most exciting recommendations for restaurant (that cater towards our very specific needs)as well as sights to visit that is off the beaten path, which in my opinion shows that his knowledge is very in-depth, personal and not taken out of your run of the mill guide book. Besides Mr. Jackie all the staff were very attentive and the hotel breath taking. We will"
"Not at all satisfactory, not sure why anyone would pay extra for this as the choices were very poor indeed...2nd class choices of not very much food and one choice of white wine only, cheap gin and only cheap local beer...not impressed"
"I‚Äôve been staying there for couple of nights. My room was 4110, quite old.   We reserved a dinner buffet at Hotel‚Äôs restaurant (rom sai). We never been told that the food range will be cut out or unavailable. The experience was horrible, very limited food selection. I can find a better buffet in any 3-star-hotel in BKK with 1/4 of full price.  The cost of thb 1,799++ per pp is a real ripped off. They offer us 50% off after a big complain. Even after discount was still overcharged.  Totally not recommended. :("
"We had a staycation at Banyan Tree Bangkok for our wedding anniversary. We  also reserved a table at the Moon bar for dinner. The atmosphere was great. The panoramic view was stunning. The food was so delicious. The service made the night perfect for us. Khun Lek was very friendly and provided excellent service. He even took a great picture of us and printed it. Definitely, the best souvenir."
Very good service here. I booked with hungryhub promotion. The food are good and the amount is appropriate for us. The staff who name's Lek is so nice. He know what to do and recommend many good dishes. He also has good photographic techneques. Recommend to come here.
This is my first stay at Banyan Tree Hotel. Overall experience very impassive. Hotel staff very helpful specially Khun Boyo at concierge. His service very outstanding and always call me my name.  We will come back for sure üëç
"This time we stayed on 48th FL. The room is large enough and sparkling clean, well equipped with everything we need. The view of Bangkok catched our eyes. All officers provide us great service which we really appreciated."
"We had such a memorable experience with our first family stay at Banyan Tree Bangkok.   All the staffs were professional, nice and friendly. While waiting for checking in at the lobby Khun Sombat and Khun Nok took very good care of us. They even offered some cakes and drinks for our children. The chief concierge Khun Jackie, with his epic service, he handsomely upgraded our room to one-bedroom suite which was very spacious with everything so fresh and clean. They also offer various kinds of complimentary tropical fruits.  Our children love it so much that they wouldn‚Äôt want to go anywhere else.   The Moon Bar at the rooftop is a very special place to visit with a nice scenery where we could spend time to relax and see most of Bangkok beautiful landscape from the top view in both"
