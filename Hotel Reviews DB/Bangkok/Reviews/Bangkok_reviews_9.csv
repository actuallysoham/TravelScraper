"The best hotel in Sukhumvut Bangkok! The hotel has three restaurants, a swimming pool with great city views and a 24-hour gym.  special thanks to concierge Nan for the smile and great mood every day!!!"
"I have been traveling in Thailand for the past three months and stay at the Skyview Hotel when I am in Bangkok. Simply speaking, I would not stay anywhere else. The location is perfect, next to the Skytrain and in the ceter of Bangkok. Just as important, the service is wonderful - Nan and the other conceirge staff, reception and everyone have been extremely helpful and truly make a guest feel welcome. In addition, the hotel is great value for the money and the breakfast is excellent."
"Amazing location...steps from BTS and Emqaurtier Mall.  Great service especially Nan at concierge! Always look forward to staying here.  Rooms basic but very comfortable, nice floor to ceiling windows. üëç"
I visit on Friday. Very nice staff offer me early check in. My room is clean. 24 hrs fitness is flexible for me to enjoy work out. There also free bottle of water in the firness. Thank you K.Sutita for making my room.
"I really love bathtub in this Hotel with an amazing Bangkok view. Lunch ""All you can eat was very nice and delicious. Highly recommend.It's first time in this Hotel but full in love everythings was so perfect."
The hotel is located near the shopping mall and bts.  The front desk is ok. Breakfast doesn‚Äôt have much choices.  We received the happy hour voucher that is free flow to use at their bars.  Bar is nice but they don‚Äôt have much choices for cooktail in their free flow list.

"I feel disappointed with staff, Service mind in hotel industry is the most important but i didn‚Äôt see any service mind from here, especially in Vanilla sky bar and Reservation staff! I can feel unprofessional :("
I was able to enjoy the Skyview Hotel on a recent business trip and while I was there I had such an incredible visit.  A modern and sophisticated hotel offering numerous outlets to wine and dine as well as 2 roof top bars.. wow!!  I especially appreciate the amazing location next to Emporium Mall and just a small step to the sky train that can take me anywhere in Bangkok in only a matter of minutes.   The staff were very friendly and I even had a opportunity to speak to their helpful General Manager Markus.   I will definitely be back and recommend highly!
"We stayed for four nights and really enjoyed it. Lovely room very clean and comfortable our package of Your Stay Your Way with 90 min free flow drinks was good value. The first night we could not get into the roof top bar as they had a private party, so had drinks in one of the restaurants excellent Margaritas. Next night rooftop bar choice of 3 cocktails no Margaritas and not so special cocktails so nice glass of wine instead shame they had a different cocktail choice.The staff in every department were excellent and very friendly and efficient. Breakfast was a la cart good choice and delicious. We loved our stay and will return in the next few months."
"It was a short visited 1 night but full of nice memories. Staff were very nice, Khun Korn, Khun Pae at front desk and room service, delicious breakfast served in the room was sooooo comfy after waking up from hangover, love everything there, cocktail was tasty and strong. We reserved the room package including free flow alcohol 90 minutes at the Mojjo bar that was valuable for this period. 100% recommended. I will go back there for sure because it is few minutes to Emporium and Emquatier, very convenience."
"It's good for our experience in package with 24-hour-stay room with ABF and 90-min-free flow alcohol: beer/wine/cocktail and mocktail. However, cocktail and mocktail were not exciting and limited menu with 3 choices each.  Room is clean with quite full amenities. Still look new although Hotel opened for 4 years. TV programme have less chanel.  ABF is a la cart menu with variety choices. Delicious fried rice and good pork congee.  üòÄüòÄ"
"Produce used for breakfast was very poor  7/11 sausages and bread  Poached eggs hard   Called duty manager on the phone to notify  Said due to covid   Rooms and lobby look excellent   Asked for cutlery to be sent to my room first night, arrived 30 mins later after 3 phone calls  Would recommend staying elsewhere"
"The restaurant located on 7 floor with great variety of food, free flow of beer and sparkling wine. You can choose many dishes from order list including brunch price. Good place to enjoy family meal. Good service and reasonable price"
"I only stayed here for 1 night. Convenient location, few minutes walk to BTS. Next to a shopping mall. Nice welcome by front office, nice room, little bit noisy air-con. Expedia ViP hotel, free late check out 2hrs. Due too Covid they request for in room breakfast. Breakfast was delicious."
"The facilities and location of the Compass Skyview hotel in Bangkok are fantastic. The hotel is just minutes walk from the BTS, with links to the whole of the city. The hotel is equipped with a great rooftop pool, bars and restaurants, offering a wide range of cuisines.  From our experience, the hotel sadly falls far short of its 5 star rating on the one thing that Thais are so famous for having in abundance: their hospitality. My wife and I recently stayed at the hotel on their very appealing ‚Äústaycation‚Äù package that they are currently promoting to Thai nationals and residents, which is inclusive of all meals and use of standard amenities. However, we were left feeling disappointed and, on occasions, uncomfortable by the cold and impersonal front of house team, to the surly"
We stayed here for 2 nights. The bed is comfortable; facilities are great. We liked the pool and the gym. What we enjoyed the most is the food here. Our room was facing EmQuartier so we really had a nice view. Just a few minutes walk from BTS Promphong station and just next to Emporium.
"I booked this hotel last minute because my other hotel in Bangkok was renovating the gym and pool. The location is near lots of shopping, cafes, etc. Overall felt the hotel was averagel. Loads of people raved about the breakfast, but I am not sure why. Hash browns were like tater tots that had been defrosted. Lunch time I tired a pizza that was served with a side of ketchup. I think after so many tries I just gave up on the food. If you stay here I recommend not eating here. Pool and gym were nice. A couple of the machines were out of order in the gym. They have a huge selection of cardio machines and free weights. My first day staying there I was gone almost the entire day and left the service light on in my room. Was surprised to return to my room after 8pm and find that"
"Stayed here for a night to spend a day off from work. I was not disappointed with the services. Staff were nice, food were great, we even got an upgrade to a suite. Thank you for treating us like royalties. Will recommend"
"stayed for a long weekend, very clean, service was great.breakfast in prime restaurant was excellent only downside was the pool was very busy in the afternoon as it was a pool bar open to the public. great location for transport and shopping"
"Myself and my Wife spent 3 nights at the Compass Skyview Hotel , this was our experience .  Upon arrival Sunday evening from the Airport we were greeted by a Lady on the front  reception that did'nt sound in great health continually coughing , which any other time was probably ok ? But in the current enviroment , I thought that it wasnt a great welcoming to the Hotel , that said Im sure the hotel checked her health and she was perfectly ok?  After the first night my Wife reported to staff of unusual noises coming from the Aircon that were a bit noisy , they replied they will send someone to look at it , while we were out . On return we recieved a letter saying , Aircon maintanance will take place the following day 12-2pm !!! Conviently after we already checked out , so good luck"
"We stayed for three nights at the beginning of March and absolutely loved the place. Great location, great staff & great facilities. We enjoyed using the large & fantastically equipped gym. Loved having cocktails at the rooftop bars (vanilla sky & Mojo), & loved the pool - I know some viewers have said its small, but we thought it was appropriate & sophisticated (very adult pool). We were offered an upgrade to a suite from a grand executive room, but preferred the grand executive room with the bath tub, which had great city views. Clean, comfortable rooms with amazing feeling sheets on the bed (best we‚Äôve slept in). We‚Äôd stay here again.   Our only disappointment was that cocktails at the bar were expensive for Bangkok prices & tasted watered down."
"1. Located next to Emporium Shopping Plaza where supermarkets, restaurants, food courts and department stores all conveniently adjourned. 2. Next to Pronpom BTS station. Within 15 minutes ride to Siam Square, World Trade Center. 3. Reasonable size room with best quiet air con unit made by Samsung for good cooling efficiency. 4. Good breakfast selection with very fresh fruits and vegetables."
"The Compass Skyview Hotel is located in the bustling and fashionable Sukhumvit area of Bangkok.  Specifically, it is conviently located at the Phrom Phong station of the BTS SkyTrain, just on the other side of the fashionable Emporium mall.   There are many restaurants and much shopping in the area.  There is a large upscale grocery on the 5th floor of the Emporium plus a 7-11 across the street from the hotel.  The hotel is very modern and is kept in very super condition.  I stayed with my wife in a family connecting room with club lounge access.  This suite has a separate living area, two bedrooms(which can be closed off from each other), and two bathrooms (one with a shower enclosure and large bathtub and the other with a shower enclosure).  The living area, in addition to the"
"We liked the pool because the view was great, it was a rooftop pool with a bar and it was open until 9pm. The room was really nice, very luxurious with a great view. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. It it is near to a BTS Line. In a quiet (for Bangkok) area. No negatives to report from us."
"This hotel is my first choice when I‚Äôm in Bangkok. On my recent stay, Ms Kiri Buasir(Cherry) from the Silverlining club lounge was very prompt and attentive to all my needs, she‚Äôs one staff that needs mentioning, all email enquires was answered promptly even before I checked in, every morning I‚Äôm being greeted with a big smile and she does an excellent job during breakfast service, checking out  was equally smooth. Thanks Compass Skyview for a wonderful stay and also to Ms Cherry.   Nicholas"
First time staying in this hotel just wanted to have a try. And is exceed expectations. Prime location very convenient to going around. Bts station just 3 mins walking distance. Shopping and food stalls everywhere. Room is bright and clean. Front desk staff was excellent and helpful. Especially a gentleman name Trin was outstanding very patient and helpful to assist me with some issue. Sky bar staff is  also very friendly and serving with smile. Last but not least housekeeping also amazing. Even though have to informed 3 times to clean my room. Overall this hotel you will never regret to stay. Will come back again. Thumbs up !!! For the hospitality.
"First let me say I‚Äôm a frequent visitor to the sky bar but it‚Äôs the first time I have stayed in this hotel.  Checked in to the room and it was extremely hot.  Turned the aircon on and it wasn‚Äôt cooling the room off.  After about an hour of the aircon on full blast it was still sweltering hot and I was sweating like crazy.  I called the front desk and maintenance came up and worked on the aircon for about 30 minutes.  He determined he couldn‚Äôt fix it.  I spoke with the manager asking for nothing more than another room with working aircon, simple right.  This guy was unbelievable, he told me I could stay in the room for another 3 hours or leave and they will try and fix the aircon.  If that didn‚Äôt work they would look into another room.    Long story short, I got a refund and left"
"Stayed for one night, although arriving after resturant was close, they have an excellent room service with wide range of choice of food. The view from the Bar on the 32 floor is beautiful. WIFI is free and good. Shower pressure is also good. I had to leave at 14:30 so asked for late checkout and the stuff at the front desk offer this for free with no charge"
"We booked the hotel much earlier and so the price was reasonable. The location was a plus point because it is just besides Emporium Shopping Mall and walking distance to EmQuartier and BTS. Therefore location is excellent.  We stayed in Premier Room. Nice and spacious room. It was clean, thanks to iB(HK) who cleaned our room throughout the stay. However, a few points I wish to highlight to the hotel so that they can improve better. The aircon was a bit noisy and was louder when at night where surroundings is quiet. Toilet drainage seems to have problem. The glass panel at bathtub looks like a high risk possible accident. The side of glass is fixed to the wall, but the bottom of the glass panel is not. Hence, if someone accidentally hold the glass panel as support, it could break"
"This is a very affordable but well appointed hotel in Bangkok.  Close to many things including train stations, food places , all within walking distance.  Has an interesting upper section where its a club type membership.  Have not been in, looked pricey.  the breakfasts are excellent, the restaurants are very good as well.  the sky view is not as high as some, but still excellent ambience."
"I've stayed at this hotel twice now and can only recommend it.  Location, pool, service are all good...Breakfast is probably a 7/10.   Rooms are contemporary and spotless with nice views.  I have stayed both times in a club room with check-in upstairs, evening snacks and wine and use of the lounge with a nice balcony area..Special shoutout to Sun for her awesome hospitality..we worked until the late evening and arrived back at the hotel at 8pm when the light meal ends, Sun kept it open for us which really helped smooth out the rest of the night."
"We have really good service with the hotel, and workers Nan, Toey, Green help us to get transfer to our next hotel in Pattaya - thanks to them all. Rooms are really beautifull and comfortable, and really tasty food on breakfast - i recommend to try omlette)"
"Perfect hotel in my life with tripadvisor Mook, Pop are very friendly. The room was very clean and nice view. i highly reccommend this hotel for everyone who is finding some hotel. the hotel also near the shopping mall."
"Stayed for 2 nights. Room was clean, quiet, very well equipped and had great views. Nice pool area. Staff members are very helpfull.  Hotel has its own Skybar with stunning views. Great for drinks during sunset."
"This hotel is so nice and service is excellent. Thank you for your service. If I visit bangkok, I want to visit this hotel again. Her name is PAE and she is so nice girl.  Thank you so much again and I love bangkok!"
"We stay 4 nights in this hotel and everything is nice and perfect. rooms with great view, friendly staff, great breakfast, good location but today is the second time I wanted to relax at the pool which was not possible because of a pool party. Next time I would appreciate it if I.could be informed from before about events like this so I could have booked elsewhere."
"I recently stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and I would like to say that I had a very pleasant stay. The hotel staff were all very friendly and they were very helpful. The breakfast team was amazing and accommodated my family‚Äôs dietary restrictions. Overall, the hotel had great hospitality and I would highly recommend this hotel to those travel and wanting to find a home away from home."
"We booked a club grand premier room in this hotel on the 28th floor. Checkin was fast and friendly, room equipped according our expectations, however, a little small considering it should be a ‚ÄûGrand‚Äú room. After checkin we enjoyed the nice pool, then decided to go up to the Mojjo and Vanilla sky bar (separate review).  When trying to go up we faced long waiting times with the escalator for the first time. This continued during our stay especially when there were private events on the upper floors. Several times we faced the situation that elevators were blocked by the staff bringing stuff from lower floors to upper floors and vice versa. Again not only long waiting times, but if elevator finally arrived it was simply not possible to go in.  Also there is only one elevator for"
"My wife and I had a pleasant vacation stay at the Compass Skyview Hotel, Sukhumvit 24, Bangkok. The high floor room we stayed in was quiet, clean and comfortable. Complimentary happy hour with a panoramic city view on the 33rd floor. Efficient aircon and internet and good buffet breakfast. This hotel has a great location, a few minutes walk to the Skytrain station and is next to two big shopping malls, the Emporium and Emquartier. It also has a very good Japanese restaurant."
"pae,aim good service very flexible check in and good room very confortabel stay the hotel good location close to shopping mall close bts station room very clen good to say here  for  out trip so i will comeback agian time"
"Aoi,Chelsea, and Na did a very good job as our servers.  They were very friendly and the atmosphere was amazing.  We had Sassy Juicy and My Sunshine as our drinks and they were fantastic.  I would recommend this place for business-talking, chilling with friends and relaxing with your girlfriend/boyfriend."
"Aoi, Pen and Title looked after us well and cocktails was delicious. Had the signature cocktails and they were to die for. Recommend having the Vanilla Sky signature cocktail.   Roof top view was beautiful.   Will come again."
This is the 2nd time I stayed in this hotel. It is clean and neat. The location is really good only 2 minutes walk to shopping mall and BTS. The staffs here are helpful and friendly especially Ms Pea.
Executive suite rooms are spacious and come with full kitchen and laundry.  Free happy hour every night was the daily highlight with freeflow drinks and delicious appetizers. Special shoutout to Khun Sun and Sa for outstanding hospitality and attention to detail.  Will continue to use Compass Skyview for business travel
"This is a truly 5 star experience. We stayed here 5 nights over new year and it was an amzing stay. The hotel is luxurius, bright, modern and the location is amazing. We had the family connecting suit and its superb. 92 sqm with to bedrooms and bathrooms, open kitchen with a lounge. It got three TVs and three individual ACs.  But the best was the clublevel access. What a bargain it was, when we discovered what was included. Amazing breakfast, all day softdrinks, end it said canapees and drinks 6-8pm. It was not canapees but an buffet and ala carte from the same kitchen as the Mojjo Restaurant. And free flow of longdrinks, wine, beer etc. We ate and drank for at leat 3000thb evey day and we also got an very good rate for the suite.  The service etc was excellent, and the location"
Nice hotel to stay with as usual. Clean rooms and good service at all times. Been here more than 5 times in 2019 for business and this hotel always lived to the expectations. It was a busy week just before Christmas but that did not deter Pae and Pop at the front desk in providing excellent customer service. Overall a fantastic experience in 2019 and hope the same in 2020 :-)
"2 twin rooms on the same floor was booked in 3 months ago but still cannot be arranged at the time we check-in.  Wait for 1 & half hours long for re-arrangement but still can only offered us 1 king & 1 twin on the same floor.  No air-conditioning on the 3rd and 4th night made us not sleep well at all and forced us to move to other room on the lower floor near the garbage room.  Under such room re-arrangement we cannot go up to meet my family whenever we want because the room key only allows you to access the floor where you stay.  At the end we only receive the response from the staff and the manager was ""sorry"" !!!"
"While the room is nice, the friendly staff made the stay pleasant. Special thanks to the staff at Silver Lining Club Lounge for the excellent services. They made the evening chill out pleasant. Perhaps would be good to make the outdoor area of the lounge more vibrant. It is so dull and gloomy."
"We  stayed here for 3 nights at the end of our holiday, this was our third stay here, always book a club room with sky benefits, well worth the little extra cost.  Treated like royalty on arrival, ushered upto the silver lining lounge for private check in, the staff are very efficient but friendly, we were upgraded to a room with a bathtub.  Breakfast in silver lining is a pleasant experience, plenty to choose from, soft drinks are also available all day, wine, cocktails and snacks are included from 6 till 8pm.  The pool area is kept clean, the staff are attentive, plenty of loungers in the sun and shaded area undercover if it gets too hot in the sun.  The hotel is well placed in sukhumvit for shopping at the Emporium or Terminal 21 is easily reached by BTS.  Would definately"
"very nicely decorated hotel, room was spacious and design was futuristic. location was strategic as very near to bts station, just couple of minutes walk and near to shopping mall. staff service was great!"

Had a great stay here. Tik looked after me on reception. I got an upgrade to a lovely room on floor 30. Excellent room. Comfy bed and superb bathroom. I am back in February and hope to stay here again. Wonderful location too right by Emporium. Many thanks!!
"Have stayed at Compass Skyview Hotel by Compass Hospitality (SkyView Grand Premier Room) for 3 nights during end Nov 2019. LOCATION * Get off at BTS-Phrom Phong Exit 2.  There are two ways to Hotel : (a) there is a footbridge on the left hand side to Emporium (M/F), go to G/F, where there is an exit next to Starbucks (taxi station in front of Starbucks), the hotel is exactly next to this exit. (2) take the stairs (left hand side) down to the main road, turn into the inner street next to NaRaYa Bag store, it takes about 5 minutes to the hotel. However, the pavement is narrow, it might be inconvenient if carry big luggage. * There is a big 7-11 convenience store opposite to the hotel. * From BTS-Phrom Phong Exit 2, you could go directly to Emporium and EmQuartier (they are facing"
"pretty nice rooms, special architecture, excellent breakfast, big gym, well equipped, friendly and helpful staff at the front desk. The roof top bar is a hidden champion - really breathtaking view and not crowed at all"
"Fantastic and attentive service from  Cherry and Eve. All the staff are excellent.  Great hotel, food and cocktails. Would recommend upgrading to club premier. Located a minute's walk from a blue line station."
"Went there last month for my birthday trip with family. Booked a family suite which could accommodate 3 adults + 1 child. Arrived at the hotel to find out that there‚Äôs only 1 bed in the room and the other ‚Äúbed‚Äù had to be converted by pushing 2 sofas together. My 12 yr old son had to sleep there in the end as my younger daughter bunked on the king size bed with us. Tad disappointing. But the hotel made up for it with its spotless bedroom, great service (esp the bfast at club lounge) and the superb location. It‚Äôs only 3 mins walk to the BTS station which already had a huge mall linked to it. Saw another smaller mall while on the way to the station. Opp the hotel were a couple of decent Thai massage parlours which operate till midnight. Had a surprise birthday cake from the hotel"
"I should've just stayed at this place the whole time. I was in BKK for a month and moved around a lot. It was all downhill after staying here.  Location is great, rooms are very nice, exercise room is very nice, food is very good, pool is very nice, the rooftop bar amazing...  You can pay a lot more and get a lot less."
"The hotel itself appears new and very clean. My room was great. I think it would be a very nice stay Sunday through Thursday. On the weekend, this place is over taxed.  - Mojjo Rooftop Bar: ""Closed for private event"" A wedding reception on one of the top-floors; only having three fully operational elevators after 5pm it was a challenge to get to a restaurant, gym, pool or back to your room.  -I tried ordering room service, I had to call back two times to finally get a delivery  I'll try the Hilton across the street next time."
"My 2nd stay at Compass Hotel Bangkok this year. Very convenient location, near BTS station and shopping center. Friendly staff and clean room. Having a 24hour gym is perfect.  Also there is a nearby 24hr convenience store."
"I would like to say thank you to all the receptionist, especially TIK and GREEN. When i reached the hotel and going to pay taxi, i could not find out my wallet which keeps all my cash and cards. I opened all the luggage in a great panic right in front of the hotel door. Luckily, GREEn and another staff calmed me down, paid me the taxi, called the shopping center that I thought I have lost the wallet. Furthermore, the hotel management team, ms TIK helped to check in the room without any payment in advance. All of them taked care of me while I was so worried.

"A long overdue review. This hotel is pretty new in the soi 24 area. Near to malls, eateries & BTS.    The stay was comfortable. This was my 2nd stay in this hotel. Expected a bigger room for the price. Got a bigger room in the 1st stay.    Would like to mention Tookta, Chumpul & Pop for their hospitality."
"I had not been thinking that view was important to choose the hotel before visiting this hotel.   Can you imagine? You cannot see anything even though your room has a big window. Only see the wall of the building which is very near from your room. I attached the picture I took..  It should be notified before booking..If I had known that, I would 'not' choose this hotel definitely.  I asked to change the room because of this terrible view, however the option was also not good-you can see dirty things on the top of building like old antenna.  So finally I change the room with better view by paying additional charge..  Terrible memories here..."
"Short break. Booked in today. 2 bed suite - lots of space, excellent facilities and well appointed.  Staff exceptionally welcoming, helpful, and pleasant.  Super location close to shops and transport links. So far - EXCELLENT!"

"We stay in compass skyview hotel 4d3n in Oct 2019. Very nice location , only need 3mins walk to Emporium shopping mall and 5 mins to the bts phrom phong. They‚Äôve good services and staffs are friendly and helpful  ! Yummy breakfast And many foods you can eat!"
"Compass Skyview is a new hotel I decided to try when visiting Bangkok with my family (3 adults and a 7 yo child). The hotel is modern with good apartment like facilities and located very conveniently. It is a 2 minute walk from Emporium Mall, and a 5 min walk to Phrom Phong BTS station (door to door). Upon check in, we realized the photos shown on hotels.com were inconsistent with the reality of a 2 bedroom-connecting unit. The staff were very efficient and took quick measures to fix this issue with a free upgrade to a unit with the correct facilities. This was impressive to say the least, and i would like to give special thanks to the female employee who took the initiative to get this done. I was not in time to get her name unfortunately, but she wore glasses, had short hair,"
"Hotel on a great location near Phrom Phong BTS, next to a mall was very convenient. Many restaurant and cafe near by. Hotel staff was so sweet set up a surprise for us in our room upon our arrival (Thank you!). 24 hour Fitnesses Center was my husband‚Äôs favorite. I had stay many other hotesl in that area. But I‚Äôm sure I will stay there again."
"Centrally located, conveniently situated next to the subway and the mall, clean, courteous, friendly, fashionably appointed, an open air swimming pool on the 7th floor that wasn't crowded and very relaxing. Finally, the most pleasant surprise was my room has a free standing bath tube with view. Highly recommended."
All is very very ok ok. Recommended üòçit is closed to a big shopping mall and closed ti sky train station. All staff is very very nice to service you along the stay. I recommended if you want to find good hotel to stay in heart of Bangkok
"hotel rooms are not fit for three bed!  our roll away additional bed was almost low to the ground.  not worth the price paid.  furthermore, our beds are too soft - add pains to the back  hotel location was great and breakfast was also good"
The design of room is modern. Staff are extremely helpful and understanding. We were given very useful advice about what transport to take to reach the airport. We departed from hotel at 3am in the morning. The taxi was arranged with no delay. Thank you Skyview.
"If you do not hope the sky view, you would not be disappointed. I expect a room in high floor, rather than an upgraded room in low floor. Many hotels in Bangkok, I will try other one in next time visit."
"Stayed here during a business trip, with a late check in around midnight.   Good location, 3 min walking distance from a BTS station, and there's a lot of good thai and jap food around the corner.  Fitness centre was good, with a swimming pool, and don't skip on the breakfast if its include (it's really good!). Do control yourself to go and enjoy the delicious breakfast options nearby. The rooftop bar offers a good view over the Bangkok city.  Stayed in the suite, and the room was spacious with a very good view.   24/7 amenities are nearby if you need anything."
"This was a very nice hotel in Sukhumvit. It is extremely convenient to the skytrain. The hotel staff in the lobby and in the restaurants were all very friendly, helpful and welcoming. I very much enjoyed the breakfast, and it's great to have 24-hour room service available (super good spring rolls and cheesecake). The rooftop bar was beautiful. There are multiple restaurants and bars, including also at the lovely pool.   My room was very comfortable and clean. The furniture, bathroom, and window view were all very nice. Wifi worked great. I was very happy that they also had a same-day laundry service.  I am an English-speaking woman who was traveling by myself for work, and I felt comfortable at the Compass Skyview Hotel."
"I stayed at the Skyview for one week whilst attending a conference at BITEC. The position of the  hotel is excellent  for Bangkok, a few minutes walk from a BTS Skytrain station. The club rooms have excellent views with ground to ceiling windows. I found the hotel very quiet and relaxing in a very bustling Bangkok. Nice swimming pool. Staff were very helpful , especially , Peary , Ice and Green.  Excellent value for money."
Excellent room and facility with lovely service in every part of the hotel. Khun Pao and Khun Jan at the Front desk were so kind and helpful. The staff at Mojjo bar all so nice. We enjoy every moment during the stay. Thank you so much :-)
"We stayed at Compass Skyview Hotel for 7 nights. We got a great service from the staffs in the hotel, especially M. iB (HK) who made up our room very clean and made us stay comfortably. Thank you iB(HK)."
"I commend whole staff for service and effort to be best. I feel like best friend and only guest, but they treat all guests the same. Anko and AU and team are great, so are bartenders. Ice, Sun, Mook awesome, Kung very good service, she make breakfast time feel like vacation. Keep up the good service, you all make upper management look real good and organized.  khop khun krap.  BJa"
"We stayed at Compass Skyview Hotel for 4 days in their Grand Executive room. We had great service from everyone in the hotel, especially Ms Ice who checked us in, whom was efficient and attentive to our requests. The room is clean, modern looking and has a great view overlooking Emquartier mall. The bed is comfortable  and we slept really well. The breakfast selection is decent and delicious. The location is superb, just a short walk to Prompong BTS station, and the 2 malls next to it. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Compass Skyview, and will stay again for its value, service, location and comfort."

"The services are still in excellent level, compare with my first stay at January 2017. Extremely close to BTS station. One of the best choice with the budget of 4000 bahts per night in Phrom Phong area. Will come again for sure!"
Fifth stay here and my go-to hotel in Bangkok. Exceptional stay and  wonderful hospitality. Thank you Pea and Pop for the impeccable service. Would definitely return!  Swimming pool and gym were nice too!!!
"This is an absolutely excellent hotel with absolutely exceptional service, in particular Pop and Pae at the front desk who were very helpful. Pop went above and beyond for us to ensure we had a pleasant stay. The roof top bar is a must visit at sunset."
"Compass Skyview Hotel,perfect location beside with Phrom Phong station and Emquartier& emporium department store, and the Oasis spa offers free shuttle to thehotel. In addition,the room with bed are super comfortable more then 5stars, the hotel staffs are very enthusiastic to help, tks Mrs. Sa. Extra plus 32F Sky bar offers unbeatable views and is worth staying  again definitely."
Found hotel convenient with the BTS a few minutes walk away. The hotel is generally well maintained and clean. Rooms are adequately sized and offers a great view of the city. Breakfast was good and has good options.
"We checked into the sky club rooms which were really nice, spacious and comfortable. Went to the drinks and snacks evening and were really impressed by the quality of food they offered plus the drinks and cocktails were really nice. Sun and Cherry were very attentive and ensured we had a lovely time. Later we went to the sky bar for a drink and found the view quite spectacular. It‚Äôs great to look over Bangkok at night from above. The breakfast the next morning was more than ample and there was lots to choose from.  The chef cooked my eggs to perfection. Service here was again really good. Overall I‚Äôd highly recommend this hotel for all round experience. Thanks for a great stay."
Location was excellent.  Next to Emporium Mall and other interesting sites. Breakfast was excellent and rooms were exceptionally clean with a god view of the city.  Gym facilities were up to date and well maintained.
"This hotel have a very excellent location which takes only 5 minutes walk to the BTS station. On arrival, the hotel staff give us a warm smile and welcome drink. I want to appreciate one of the woman manger with short hair and glasses in the buffet restaurant, as she present a five star service to us. The water pressures inside the room that the hotel first assign to us is weak, we told that manager and she kindly arrange another room to us immediately. She even bring us to see the new room by herself. Overall, the service was fabulous and the environment is beautiful also. Hope to return this hotel during next visit to Bangkok!!!"
"Hotel is just next to Emporium  and Emquatier shopping mall, very convenient. The lane outside hotel has many massage shops to choose. Staff were very helpful. Concierge staff were ready to make reservations, contact massage stores when requested. My special thanks to Tik, and her colleague who helped me stop bleeding on my finger, when I had a deep cut. Blood kept running out for 15 minutes! Tik even offered to change my dressing in the evening if I needed to. She came to me to see how I was when checking out the next morning. I really appreciate their help."
"The hotel is very beautiful, good staff especially NaN, PiA and Phan where amazing. The staff at the reception where amazing. Good rooftop pool with nice view, rooftop bar was amazing with wonderful views. The Gym is 24 hours which was perfect for me so I could go wherever I want no matter the time . Nice buffet breakfast. don‚Äôt have a second thought. Just go ahead and book this hotel . One of the best in Bangkok"
"When I have arrived, they welcomed me & my wife very warmly. Especially, Ms.Pea who arranged my booking was very kind & nice. She patietly explained the hotel.  There are several shppong shops near the hotel & the its very near the BTS station."
"stayed twice during a business trip to Thailand. Enjoyed everything one can enjoy in a hotel, the area was great, easy access to shopping, restaurants and the elevated train. The service at the hotel is impacable, the staff very attentive to all requests, rooms are extremely comfortable and the views from the top floors are great. Silver Lining club on the 33 floor offers great amenities, and services, please don't miss that."
My friend and I stayed at the hotel about a month ago. The location of this hotel was great. We only booked the hotel 2 days ahead and we didn't even have time to exchange some thai bucks before I went. The hotel was right next to a mall that had a great currency exchange shop famous for reasonable / high exchange rate (superrich). The breakfast buffet there was not bad as well. The staff there were really well trained and provided exceptional customer service. The first person we met at the front desk was Pao HK. He is a very nice guy greeted us with smile. The room were clean and tidy. I would recommend my friend to stay at this hotel.
Amazing customer service!!  Definitely recommended ‚ù§Ô∏èüåÜ Beautiful sky view Room has everything you need  Food is delicious and they even have 24hrs room service Clean and always smells fresh Very safe and quite  ask for chan she will definitely help you with any request
"New, well maintained hotel in a super location 1 minutes walk from emporium which was extremely helpful for us because we were travelling with a toddler, so it meant we could go back to our room in five minutes no matter where we were in Emquartier and shops/ restaurants/cineplex stone's throw away . Stayed in a suite. Suites were fine but felt a little bare although they had all the expected amenities. Adding some colour/rug/cushions and a few little touches of luxury/comfort could really take things up a notch, but this is not a criticism at all just an observation. Had a pleasant stay with good service. V decent breakfast and overall much better value for money than Emporium suites in my opinion if you are looking to stay in close proximity to Emquartier. Would stay again,"
