"Arrived with my kids around 9pm. So tired for the whole week and checked in to this hotel hoping for a relaxing experience. Check in process was normal but they said they can only give standby key for some reason. I don't mind any key as long it works.  When we went up, the so called key was not working and I went to the phone nearby asking for help. The front desk guy said he will come up now. After several minutes, no one came and I kept calling the front desk and used the chatting function. After 10-15 minutes waiting at the door with kids lying on the hallway carpet and sweating due to not so cold air-condition, 1 lady arrived without saying anything until I said something. She just replied without even mentioning sorry ""oh, dah lama ke tunggu?"" or in english ""oh, how long"
"Booked 3 rooms for our reunion Dinner.  Breezy Suite, Urban Double, Standard Room. We ordered the packaged Chinese New Year dinner and got the team at Aloft to serve it in the suite.  Food was good and worth the money. The Team were friendly. And the rooms were of a good value.  I booked all three rooms under my Marriott Bonvoy account but some how the room still isn't featured on my profile. And the air-conditioning isn't cold. And the blinds In the urban room didn't work.  Hence the 4 stars out of 5."
"Really nice place, good service, best place, good staffs excellnt i like the swimming pool so beautiful and i'm so glad and hopefully one day i can come back there again soon best regard from bali üòçüòò"
"There are a few points I have noted in this stay.   a) Check in - it was alright but I hv commented the staff made me move to a specific area to check in (with the transparent shield), which I am totally fine to abide to the rules they have set. But when another guest did not do the same the staff was ok with it? Why wasn't he told to go to the shield? Also, he pulled his mask down beneath his chin (pictured)... So the staff had just exposed himself right? Immediately felt double standards.... And had raised this to another staff. Hopefully no more recurring of such incidents.  b) Room - dark, tired & basic. Somehow the design of the room is weird. But, can't complain for the price and this cannot change.  c) Request for amenities - it takes forever. If you can wait for 3 hours."
"Full review, more photos: Visit the website in my profile.  Much closer to the train station and mall than the Hilton, Le Meridien and St. Regis.  Very good complimentary breakfast sent to my room during this pandemic. This extra service is labour-intensive and I appreciated what the hotel is doing.  Was upgraded to a room on the highest floor and free minibar as a Titanium member."
The check in by Mr Kelvin rated as perfect. Very accomodative. The hotel is located next to a mall. There is even a food kiosk in the hotel for a quick grab open 24 hours. The swimming pool on the 31st floor appears well maintained. All staff are courteous & professional. The family room is rather small though.
"1. The hotel room was booked in short notice, but it was available and ready for early check-in. The reservation line was busy, so I dropped a voicemail, and the hotel returned the call. I should‚Äôve taken that as a hint that it was difficult to contact the hotel. 2. The room was clean and quite spacious. It had a funky design, true to the Aloft brand. The usage of sliding doors cleverly maximises the space of the room. 3. I‚Äôm impressed with the quality of the coffee & tea facilities and the bottled water, which were of high quality. 4. The linen and bedding were clean and comfortable. The robes were plush and super comfortable! 5. The toiletries were basic and did not satisfy. The shower gel did not lather very well. 6. I went to the breakfast buffet and paid as a walk-in"
"Due to an urgent meeting I need concentrate and away from my noisy house, I booked Aloft for work and meeting. The check in is smooth and everyone is on very strict SOP! So glad the hotel allow me to early check in, the room is as usual very clean and perfect for work!   Shout out to all the staff through the hotel, restaurant and pool deck. Your smiles makes me feels more home rather than a hotel.   The breakfast is strictly with SOP too, the food has limited choices but it‚Äôs enough for me and the quality of the food is GOOD!   Glad that Aloft still maintain its very fun and business styles after all these years. I always recommend  Aloft to my foreign friends and still will be after."
Decided to take advantage of a staycation in our city.  Well thought layout and design of the hotel. Attentive staff and good breakfast. Wish we stayed longer to explore more of what the hotel has to offer.
Very convenient to get around being literally at the transportation hub. Parking is RM10 a day or per entry as you will easily reach RM10 by 2 hours duration. NuMall is just adjacent should you forget any amenities. Also a convenient location as a landmark to meet friends. Check-in and check-out was without fuss. Very quick and straightforward. Roof top bar and pool was a cool place to hangout with a panoramic view. Missing the complimentary mini bar in the room but no complaints as the current rates due to covid is really good value. 2 large Queen beds fits a family of 4 comfortably.
"Stayed here for 4 nights and was satisfied with the room conditions, space, cleanliness and room services.   The front desk staff are very helpful and friendly.   The Hotel adheres strictly to the COVID-19 regulations and provided a safe staying environment."
"Apologies for the delay!   My last visit to this hotel about a month ago on September.   Front desk- Was very tend.  Room service- awesome! Food was amazing!  Room- clean and perfect! I love my corner room tho!  Mai Bar? Free-flow sunset by the pool? AMAZING!! Ding, many thanks for the hospitality and keep it up!"
I stayed 13 days in this Hotel and all was amazing. Thank you to all people working in for their professionality. I suggest this hotel for people travelling to KL for business or leisure. Hope to see you soon again.
"Stayed here from 29 Sep to 3 Oct. Location is excellent, rooms are good sized and cleanliness is good. Staff very friendly and service is good. Near to brickfields so those who love Indian food like me will be very happy. Nu Sentral mall is next door so shopping is great. And going to airport or getting grab is a breeze"
"am staying at Guest Room 1 King. The room was so spacious, clean and best view ever. a part of that..the teh tarik that i had for my breakfast was so Gooood. will come again. Nu Sentral and Kl sentral is just walking distance."
"Hi all, was here on Friday with my family.Great safety measures taken during COVID 19. Staff is trained and professional.Rooms are comfortable and spacious.The only thing is we experienced a extremely bad air conditioning temperature in the room. Felt so warm in the room and my kids can't sleep well.Please look into this so that people who are going to stay there enjoyed their stays with good nights sleep.Thank you."
"Thought of avoiding early traffic in order to sent my parents to North via ETS made me chose this lovely Hotel. It is just a walking distance to KL Sentral...the hubs for every rail station. The Hotel with modern deco and high class hospitality makes you wonder ,does a uniform really a necessary for your workers? Due to the fact that I noticed their workers wear jeans and collar T shirt. Unlike some Hotels. But their service is 5 Star equivalent.  Food via room service is delicious. Ordered Rib eye steak which have the same quality like a famous steak house and they really take pride of the food decorations. Congrats to their F&B Manager. Rooms is so comfy with bed and pillows are exceptionally comfortable.  My tips ..if you have small kids, just go for their rooms with 2 Queen"
"-Helpful and nice staffs -Room clean and great accommodation -Near to mall and can book for grab easily -SOP be the hotel priority -They have good staffs that could assist you and ready to help -Overall, I enjoyed stay here"
"I usually booked a hotel as 2 adults and when checkin, childrens will not be charged. It turns out they are chargable during my checkin in Aloft here.  This kind of fees should be mentioned clearly in the Bonvoy apps. If you count your baby‚Äôs in, the apps will charge additional fees and you will see the price increased.  None of the age limit stated in the apps. My 12 years old daughter was charged as adult in this case.  Their promo truly misleading me. If i know they are charging for the kids, I will not staying here."
"Wonderful Hotel next to Sentral Station and NU Sentral Mall. Good rooms at a very good rates, great food and excellent staff. Their location is close to Brickfeld and Little India. Also several sights nearby."
"This is my 1st time staying at Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral. Staff at front desk really help me, soft spoken and all my issue solve on the spot.  I loved to stay here again. Room is big and value for booking  LOL"
"If it was under any other circumstances, we would have loved to stayed a few more days extra Despite that the associates at Aloft made us feel so welcomed  Most of them recognised us and greeted us with such warmth  Almost throughout the stay we would head up to Mai Bar at Rooftop  Such a joy to be here at night  The team there were very professional and helpful   Thank you to the people at Aloft  Will see you guys soon"
"Room very comfortable, every day 4 bottle of mineral water, coffee tea in the room. Bed Room, toilet always clean. The bar on the top show give a good view of Kuala Lumpur, beer cold as desired. I was with my wife and sure we can go back if we go to Kuala Lumpur. The Central station with the Central mall next door were very helpful."
"This is my 1st stay at an Aloft property which is a vision of W Hotels. Overall it was a good stay except a tiny little issue which I would highlight in the post stay survey.  Platinum recognition was good; upgraded to Urban room with free minibar and snacks  including choice of breakfast as welcome amenity. Service by the Aloft Talents and staff were good as well, my additional teabags requests were placed in the room before my arrival and my request to get a brightly coloured Aloft pen as a souvenir was also delivered to the room swiftly. The bath amenities by Bliss was very good, but no mini bottles to bring back as souvenirs lol. Breakfast at Nook was good as well with the signature noodle station and nasi lemak pandan. Overall, was a good stay and will return again soon"
Great room. Great services by the team led by Mr Rubel. Complimentary upgrade. Free deco and cake for my daughter‚Äôs birthday. Great room rate. Cheap valet parking too. Definite my fav hotel everytime I‚Äôm in Kuala Lumpur.
"The best place to stay in Kuala Lumpur at this time. All measures are taken to follow the SOP during this pandemic time. A very good location,within walking distance to the central train station, KL Sentral. I love the room, 33 m2 is very spacious. You can control the air condition- i love this feature!  Staff are very friendly and efficient."
"Comfortable bed, clean and well-design room. Superb service from front desk. Walking distance to shopping mall and KL Sentral to moved around via public transport.  Covid-19 SOP compliance. Just need to be patience for smooth check-in."
Stayed at Aloft from 11th September till 17th Book it myself  Was so Happy and impressed with the Cleanliness & Sevice from the Reception to the Room Aslo stayed at The hotel in Langkawi from 16th August till 19th A friend made the Bookings for Langkawi  Alredy made another Booking from 10th October for my Birthday on the 11th Anyway just wanna say thank you for making my stay a very happy one Sincerely Kevin Tobin
"As a Marriot Bonvoy member, I stay at the Marriot chain hotel a lot, especially when I was in Kuala Lumpur. I decided to give Aloft KL Sentral a try, as staying at Majestic Hotel which I always frequented seems not to be a good idea. I just don‚Äôt want to be stuck in a 100 years old colonial building in a quiet corner of Kuala Lumpur city during this time when the occupancy is low. Being somewhere a bit more bustling maybe could do me good. But oh boy, I kid you not, I get more than that.  Check-in was fast. The Covid-19 SOP complied strictly. The staffs were really nice. What I requested prior check-in through the Marriot Apps was waiting for me in my room. The room could be one of the cleanest hotel room I‚Äôve ever been, maybe the big room and modern sleek interior add up to the"
Checked in this hotel for the first time with family.  Had a nice room with great view. Room is well designed and clean. The staffs are very helpful. Love the location as it is in the middle of KL and next to a big shopping mall and the central train and metro station.
"Great counter staff/reception, helpful, extremely polite, kelvin in particular. This is the 2nd time ive stayed. Choose the side facing le meridien and the higher floors for a good view of the city. The other side partially faces an office building, which is too close. Otherwise the rooms are spacious and clean, well furnishes."
"Aloft team & the surrounding - never fails to impress me. The team acknowledged my ""come back"" in Sept 2020 which became my 1st staycation after Movement Control Order (MCO) since Mar 2020. The friendliness & great hospitality from the team at all levels were awesome. I feel attached & welcomed. Hats off to Aloft team! Keep it up! Cause ""you"" never fails to impress me!"
Room is spacious and clean. Breakfast buffet was superb..centrally located where you can just park tmyour vehicle and pay flat rate of rm5 and take the mrt/lrt/ktm to explore the city. Definitely will come back
"I'm impressed with the room condition, it was big and comfy, same goes to the bathroom area, toilet and shower area were separated which is good. Room amenities was sufficient, hair dryer, Spritzer mineral water was given, there is a plunger coffee too  (although the in-room coffee and the coffee at Nook restaurant wasn't good).   I can understand we are in Covid19 period, the Nook restaurant has limited choice in breakfast buffet, table was arranging according to social distance requirements, the staff was attentive to serve as much as they could, and crowd control to the buffet line was put in placed which i find it very good.  Overall i enjoyed my stay, wish to back again in the near future."
"The hotel located at KL Sentral so you did not need to drive and can take train which will save your parking fees. I recommend this hotel if you have special occasion for yourself or buying gift for someone. They provide us compliment decoration, welcoming notes and delicious dessert for free."
"I had the best experienced during my stay even just for one night at Aloft KL sentral. Located in the hub transportation area of Kuala Lumpur, i.e. KL sentral, one can find anything here.  My choice of breakfast during the next day was spectacular. Choices of food and warm hospitality were beyond expectations. Not to mention, a big spacious room!  Good for a local like me who likes to enjoy a staycation during a weekend after a long tiring week"
Room in Aloft is the most cleanest Room I've ever seen. That shows the housekeeping really do his/her Job. It's excellent.. congratulations guys. The pillow is not really comfortable to me.  Room service is a little let down.  The rest I can't complain. Aloft is exceptionally good Hotel. ‚ù§
I was worth say for a night stay even during water disruption mayhem. And I really appreciate Logeswaary and Banu prompt email replies when I asked if Aloft KL Sentral is affected with water disruption. Luckily the hotel was not affected. Still the same convenient and cozy Aloft KL Sentral.
"I take one room with 2 queen bed, for celebrating my friend birthday which I make an arrangement a day before, but UNFORTUNATELY when I check in to the room there was NOTHING been arrange which is quite disappoint me. Then I make a call said to send the cake and balloon at 7pm. Yes they send the amenities but only the cake with perhaps a song of birthday or what but myb my expectation was high. But unfortunately again there was None! So okay we get the cake, and after that we go out and when we come back at 11pm only have the balloon in the room. Why dont they send it together right? And somemore the check in process i might said , i maybe need to stand there for about 10 minute? Why on earth took so long for check in? Try to extend for late checkout for about 30 minutes but"
"This was my first time staying in Aloft and I took 2 rooms for myself (Twin Room) and my parents-in-law (King Room). The Aloft Twin Room was spacious with 2 Queen beds and equipped with projector screen cum window slide and all the gadget friendly ports i.e. HDMI, VGA, USB charger, etc. The cleanliness was also very commendable.  A good place for a Staycation with family and a convenient breakaway spot. Located  just walking distance to KL Sentral where you can access all the public transport i.e. Monorail, LRT, KTM Train, etc. and the NU Sentral Mall.  Will definitely come again."
"Freeflow sunset drinking by the pool at Mai Bar was simply amazing.   Think you can handle stronger drinks? Ask and it shall be given. üòé  Tasha, Dylan, glad to have you both taking care of us throughout the night."
"Staying for 1 night. I was allowed to extend check-out time without charges as complimentary for my stay! Amazing welcome, strictly managed to comply with covid-19 prevention procedure. The semi-buffet breakfast was awesome. Mee mamak is one of the utmost delicious for their breakfast menu. Love it!"
"Our room window blind and phone don't work. Informed the service counter at ground flr in the morning (about 10am). Until about 4.30pm on the same day, nobody comes to fix it. I can't even use the room phone to call their reception to remind them as the phone doesn't work. So I have to call the hotel using my handphone.   In their website, their tel no. is 03-27231188. Displayed prominently. That gives rise to my second complaint. Called this number and there is an option 0 to connect to the operator. However no matter how many times you try, no operator will pick up the call. So I have to go down all the way to their ground flr to remind them to fix my window blind and phone.   Totally frustrating"
It is one of my favourite hotels in KL. Its represent a fresh new air for the hotels in KL. It is a modern and very simple hotel that emphasize on quality.    The bedding is superb. The rooftop pool is nice and overlooking the KL Sentral buildings.   The breakfast is tasty and fresh. I really like the warm bread basket that being offered with the ala cartw breakfast set.  Oh and that cute little ‚Äúkuih‚Äù also nice.
I am a return customer from Aloft Kuala Lumpur hotel. I visit this hotel whenever I have occasion in Kuala Lumpur.  1) The location is perfect 2) Situated beside one of the main station in Kuala Lumpur (KL Sentral)  3) Easy access (Walking distance)  to Nu Sentral Mall where you can find wide range of stuffs you need  4) Well trained reception staffs. They greet you whenever they see you.  5) The hotel follow all the SOP set by Malaysia Government to fight this pandemic (Covid-19) 6) Sanitize your luggage when you enter the hotel 7) Sanitize your room before you enter. The rooms are all perfectly cleaned.  8) Medium range price and very affordable for it‚Äôs location.   All these are my opinions towards Aloft Hotel Kuala Lumpur. I hope this hotel will continue provide such
"Currently offering a very cheap rate, given the location. Right next to mall, opposite KL sentral,allows food delivery from outside (but have to collect from lobby. Had to request for them to help send up as i was with young kids in room).  Room is spacious. Double queen bed. Previous stays got us complimentary mini bar and snacks. Not sure why no more. Probably due to covid SOP? I called to ask but was told no more.  Really suitable for those who needs a good night rest after a long day out exploring the city or out for work.  I didnt try breakfast with the new SOP but previous breakfast buffet offered decent breakfast."
"Aloft wasn't on my radar everytime I looked for hotels around KL, but recently I decided to give it a try.  And oh boy, how could I missed this property all these time.  The location couldn't be more perfect as it's located on the most accessible address in town. And the facilities were excellent, but it was the people (talents, as they like to call) that's the actual star of Aloft.  Yes, it has got nice rooms and beautiful swimming pool and what not. But nothing beats the welcoming feel of the human touch (no pun intended during this period of time). Every corner of the property, you will be greeted by the friendly and cheerful staff.  I guess the ""vision of W hotels"" really works.  If I was to be nitpicking, maybe the crispy and rock-hard garlic cheese naan for breakfast could"
"The hotel followed the SOP tightly. They sanitized all our luggage bags to protect all the guests. Breakfast still maintain in buffet style, where they control the number of people in the food area. Well done and I am really impressed. Totally feel safe during my stay."
It‚Äôs a doubtful journey to KL sentral at this era of global pandemic. Yet the team of Aloft KL had done great measures ensuring that proper containment had taken place. Impressive food handling and security enhancements brought peace of mind. Keep it up Aloft KL.
This hotel is close to KL Sentral but unfortunately the link from KL Sentral to hotel is close during our visit (maybe need to control the entrance). We need to cross the road and go to the hotel. The hotel able to provide the high floor arrangement as per request during booking. The view is great. The room is spacious and comfortable. Appreciate the hotel still able to provide buffet breakfast although the occupancy rate is not high during our visit. The choices is not much but we are satisfied with the food provided. The staffs are great and attentive.
"Located beside Sentral, makes public commuting very convenient.  Access to Nu Sentral mall also makes it super easy to kill time.  The infinity swimming pool has nice views and remains warm despite the rainy days.  The rooms are quite clean, and really appreciate the individually sealed salt and pepper and cups for extra precaution.  Although not all items are sealed, but compared to the recent few hotels that I have stayed during the MCO, Aloft has the best practice.    Even the buffet breakfast was carefully planned to optimize social distancing.  The staff at the Buffet is top notch in hospitality, smiling faces and eager to serve.  The room service also delivers quality without overcharging.  Love their warmer carts which keeps the food warm from kitchen to room.  We felt"
"Room was clean and spacious, more like a boutique hotel style. While there‚Äôs no buffet breakfast served, set breakfast was offered instead. But serving a complete burnt toast is totally unacceptable. Even local coffee shop can serve proper toast. Nevertheless I appreciate they do serve JING Green Tea although it wasn‚Äôt on the menu. Thank you for that."
"Friendly staff.  Good house keeping, tidy and clean room.  Good location, with 15min drive can reach the shopping mall Pavilion.  And With 15min drive can reach The Garden Mall and Mid Valley too.  Very suitable for family trip."
"This is my fourth stay at Aloft KLS after 2014. There is nothing much changes either the hotel or the room. Nothing to say about the hotel or room, everything was good, nice and tidy.  Something weird I would like to share about this stay and hope the hotel's General Manager Ms. Rubel can give me an answer at here.  1. I am booking the room by using Club Marriott membership, but the front desk didn't validate the membership card, does it means anyone can enjoy the Club Marriott's rate without the membership?  2. I am expecting some welcome gift as stated in the room rate, and there is a pack of cookies on the table together with a card written by Ms. Rubel when I get into my room. However, the card is not for me, is for another Titanium member. I am quite confusing whether the"
"Amazing place, amazing location, amazingly Clean and amazing people working there. We did enjoyed every moment we were there. Well done Aloft KL Sentral! Definitely recommend it and a must try when in KL  H√¥telier and owner myself, I was very very impressed by the kindness, professionalism of the Team as well of the caring of the place especially hygiene during this difficult period we are living.  A special thanks to Vanessa from Reservations, Matthew from Front Office and Nurul at Breakfast and of course all others.   We will stay again for sure."
"With some hesitation to book the hotel in KL due to the POST-pandemic but still decided to choose Aloft KL for Father's Day celebration.  As always, it does not disappoint with the room decoration and the warm welcome from the room director.  Plus the room rate is at the lowest point since opening and I truly enjoyed the room with the sticker of sanitizing done to the room.  Would definitely support and return!"
Aloft sentral as name suggests is right in centre of KL. You get train for any corner of of KL and there are some good eating places nearby as well. In fact a mall is connected via pedestrian bridge and is KL Sentral station. I stayed 3 times. Rooms are spacious but somehow lighting within the room was not great. BFast had good variety.
"Our stay was just wonderful. Superrb Hotel in a central location, next to Sentral Station and Nu Sentral Mall. Lots of restaurants all around. No need of a car. The staff, specially Mr. Rubel, the GM was very courteous, polite and professional. Great Food. Excellent Rooftop Bar and Pool."
"This is my 2nd stay in Aloft KL. The lobby was empty and all the eateries closed due to the Covid-19 SOPs being implemented. The room on the 24th floor was spacious as in the photo. Cosy, with a great view and everything is working order."
"I used to stay at Aloft KL whenever I go to KL for a short holiday.  Surprisingly, this is the first time we were disappointed with this hotel.  We arrived at the hotel for check in and we must say that the lobby looked like a dead place. They turn off most of the lights and there was no music as well. We truly understand that post-covid19 travels might affect hotel industry and they want to cut cost but playing some music in the lobby wont hurt! At least give us some positive welcoming vibes.  Room was great. But after staying at one of the hotels in the same area, their safety precautions for post-covid19 travels were not that great. Door was sealed for security reason which indicates that no one has entered your room since it was last sanitised. But surprisingly whenever you"
"I stayed here for 2 nights in late Dec 2019 for a final weekend getaway before the end of the year. Prepaid 670 MYR on the Marriott site for the 2 night stay including taxes but without breakfast. Upgraded to a room with a free minibar. Room was near the top floor and away from the lifts. Noisy aircon, but this helped to disguise the neighbour noise (slamming doors etc). Functional bathroom with shower but no bath. Comfortable king size bed. Good views over KL. Small but decent pool on the 30th floor (didn't actually use it though). Friendly staff. Reasonably priced room service. We were able to negotiate a late checkout which was helpful. Both checkin and checkout took a long time as the hotel was very busy. Convenient location right next to KL Sentral. Overall a very good"
"Been here almost two weeks since the movement restriction control. It‚Äôs my third or fourth stay here and my usual choice when I‚Äôm doing a long stay here or for my staff‚Äôs visit  Not your usual 5-6 star hotel, but everything is worthy. The front desk, housekeeping, security, in room dining/kitchen team have been so helpful and accommodating. And yes the GM Rubel calls you to check if you‚Äôre doing alright and updates on the latest progress. Utmost gratitude to the housekeeping team as they have been really patient and ready any time to get the room cleaned. So as the in room dining team/kitchen for my daily breakfast requests, my late hours supper, and also for remembering my tub of ice cubes every morning without requesting, very good personal touch  The pool, gym and all areas"
"I always travel to KL for work and events. For me, this hotel is one of the great hotels that easy for me to locate as it is located in KL Sentral. From there, it is easy for me to travel to any places as KL Sentral is the centre. I love everything in this hotel."
Our second time here and we were not disappointed. Excellent family suite with all the amenities needed. Took notice of what i have commented the last time and put it in practice. Was pleased to be acknowledged. This time we recommended our friends (total of 6 rooms) and they were not disappointed too.
"Stayed with family for 4 nights and had a wonderful time. Rooms and service were excellent. Amenities like infinity pool, gymnasium were awesome. Breakfast deserves a special mention as it had huge variety and their staff like Mr.Gandhi and Mr.Iyappan took special care of our needs."
Location is very strategic located near Kl sentral so easy to going everywhere. The room and bathroom is big but not too clean. The check in little bit slow but wifi is fast. Deposit money 100rm one night.
hotel staff is very professional in all respects. rooms are very clean. food at breakfast is simply gorgeous. the proximity to the KL Sentral train station is a big advantage for those wishing to use KL train servioce to commute around.
"Thanks guys for making my stay comfortable. Loved the pool, direct connectivity to the mall and hospitality. I missed trying your breakfast often but enjoyed it the day I got the time. Great place to stay!"
"The hotel's location is great, doesn't get any better than KL Sentral. The disappointment comes from the bad AC. We had to change rooms twice before we had a unit that blew a bit of cold air. I presume the property doesn't service or clean their units regularly.  On a positive note, the duty manager had a super cool personality. I really enjoyed speaking with him."
"The most upperhand element of this hotel is definitely the location. It is stratigically located within the iconic transportation hub of Kuala Lumpur, The KL central. Since it is directly accessible by the airport rail link, it makes the connection to the airport like a stone throw. There are a few famous hotel brands within this area like Hilton and Le-Meriden that can rival this hotel but what stands out the most is its immediate access to the the bustling shopping complex, NU-central. There is a direct entrance from the Hotel which makes strolling around this place so easy. However please be informed that the direct entrance to the shopping complex closes at 12 midnight. So, if you miss the boat, you have to walk up the open street to the main lobby entrance which I don't"
"Great hotel very easy access from kL Sentral. Very comfortable room and great breakfast. Check in and check out efficiency could be improved.  I arrived after 11:30pm and still took me 15 minutes to check in, the same happen during check out."
This place is just great!  The rooms are spacy with nice beds. We stayed on the 28th just below the pool level with a stunning view of KL! We spent hours in the pool and the kids loved it. Aloft is well situated near a mall and the central station. The best about this place is the breakfast!!!  So varied and good!
"My 2nd time staying here. Room is spacious, always clean and equip with facilities like iron, hair drying, etc. Staff are always friendly & accommodating. Perfect place to stay when in KL. Plus easy to find food at late hours too."
"After making my bookings, I tried reaching out to the hotel on 08 Feb 2020 but to no avail. Left a voice message and shortly after that Ms. Afrina returned my call. I told her that I would like to order a birthday cake for my sister and give her a surprise etc... and after hearing from me, Ms. Afrina told me that she could arrange the cake on complimentary basis PLUS she could also arrange some simple decoration in the room. As if I didn‚Äôt give her enough problem, I told her that my sister will arrive earlier than me. In that case my sister will get the surprise but without me around and it defeat the purpose. I then asked if that could be done when we are out for dinner and without any hesitation Ms. Afrina said yes!! How lovely can that be?   And upon arrival, Mr. Aruwin also"
"Had lovely drinks looking at the stunning view of the city. The Bar staff are lovely, very knowledgable about their drinks and their food. The cucumber Mojito was so so nice Wish we had brought our swim wear to make use of the infinity pool."
"Stay at this hotel last year with a bad air conditioning and water temperature issue. We gave them another try but turn out another unpleasant experience with air conditioning issue.   We stayed in room 2801. Room wasn‚Äôt cold even we set temperature at 18c. The room facing the office building.    Breakfast Experience. Good variety from asian to western. Friendly Indian chef.  Only chilled juice, used to have freshly squeezed orange juice but no more. Good assorted of fruits. They have this hawker shop type of pink cutleries holder on the table, not really hotel standard and not hygienic as many guests can touch the cutlery and transmitted germs/ bacteria/ virus on it.  We are about concern about it.   Pool is nice but it‚Äôs full.  I notice there is some backpacker using the pool"
"Just a five minute walk from the express train station.  Overall, the hotel is very good. Service is very helpful. Room attendant does a great job.  The thing that impressed me was the wifi in the lifts. For this hotel, the signal strength remains at four bars even when moving inbetween floors. Short cab rides to main malls and eateries. However, there is a big mall next to the hotel too, so, no worries where food is concerned."
"This hotel had a strategic location. It located near KL Sentral and you do ‚Äòt even need to across the street, there is a walkway from KL Sentral to the hotel, through the NU Sentral mall. The mall itself also host many shops and boutique.   The room was perfect. Good amenities in the room.   The breakfast was wonderful with plenty of choices.  If you need the accommodation near the KL train hub, this is the right place to stay. I really recommend it."
"Short business Trip. Great location, easy access to KL Sentral & the Airport through KLIA Express.  Spacious & comfy rooms. Free mini bar. Good food & friendly service.  I can't think of any cons during my stay. Will definitely come back."
I attended a course at the hotel today (12/2/2020). The food (yogurt) served during breakfast had passed the expiry date (8/2/2020). The issue was escalated to the GM Rubel Miah. Very dissapointing! Something like this should never happen. This is not a way to save cost.
"Been there many times . Convenient location , from the airport , you can take the Klia express train and alight at KL Sentral . 5 minutes walk to the hotel  Good services from the hotel‚Äôs team especially the FNB.  Staff knows your preference if you are a regular customer .  There is a big shopping mall ( NU Sentral) beside the hotel"
"We‚Äôve stayed here on multiple occasions over several years and our last stay was as good as the first. The feeling of the hotel is very welcoming, the staff exceptionally helpful, the rooms comfortable, clean and spacious and the facilities extensive and well maintained. Add all this to its very convenient location and reasonable price, and you can see why it‚Äôs our favourite hotel in KL"
I had an amazing stay just for a night with excellent customer service from the front desk and 2 room service guy. Bathroom amazingly beautiful simple and chic design. The bed is so comfortable and the plus point is they located next to Nu Sentral for shopping and movies. Mai Bar and the pool is just like you floating on the sky with magnificent KL sentral view
"Even though I just stayed for about 11 hours due to transit mode, I can feel this hotel is the best hotel I have stayed so far. Very informative staff at the reception (sorry I forgot his name), spacious room and comfortable, upgraded to free minibar, perfect amenities and great location. I definitely will book to stay again.. soon."
me and friends spent a night embracing 2020.  The room is spacious and lotsa eating places nearby which is great.  Nonetheless the checking experience was bit horor as the counter is small and guests were overwhelming.
"Stayed at Aloft from 16-Jan to 20-Jan. Chose Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral for my family stay because of its attractive price, huge room with twins Queen Size Beds, rooftop bar and swimming pool, good spread of breakfast, 3 to 4 minutes walking distance to trains (inclusive Airport Express)/buses/shopping mall (sheltered connector).  Compared to the two international Sentral hotels within the same vicinity that I have stayed previously, Aloft is indeed value for money especially its room size. Aloft staff is also friendly and attentive to guests needs. A worthwhile and enjoyable stay. Will definitely book to stay here again"
"Hi... service was excellent. Hospitality too good. Rooms was nice. I like to visit again there.  Further, restaurant service perfect. Thank u so much. I'll reccomend to my friends. Well take cared staff."
I choose Aloft Kuala Lumpur Sentral for my stay is because of its friendly price and equipped with a rooftop bar and swimming pool. The location is excellent as it is connected with a large shopping mall and the train station with Airport Express Train.The service is very good too. Thank you for Farid and Rowen providing excellent service during my stay. Definitely stay here again.
"Very conveniently located for the airport express train; and Sentra station is a good hub for getting around the city. Our room was spacious, comfortable and quiet. Breakfast was excellent, with a wide choice of cuisines."
"The Aloft KL Sentral hotel is centrally located next to KL Sentral, the hub for trains in and out of Kuala Lumpur. The KLIA Express, a 30-minute express train to and from the KL International Airport, is within 2 minutes walking distance to the hotel. The hotel is connected a the NU Sentral Mall, and there are many restaurants within the mall and along the roads next to KL Sentral. The check-in and check-out process at the Aloft KL Sentral was smooth, and the room was well designed and clean. It does not have all the luxuries of a 5-star hotel, but this is a high 4-star of extremely great value. I would recommend this hotel based on my recent experience."
"Stayed in this hotel for a short business trip. Hotel is located around KL Sentral station which made it easy to access. If you take KL Express, you can walk to this hotel through inside of this station and ithe direction is clearly marked. Check in was standard. We were given key cards and breakfast coupons. Room is decently sized, has comfortable bed, has a working table in one of the corner and large LED tv with international news programs. There is a fridge, but you have to purchase the content if you want at the bar downstairs. The room lighting should be made a bit brighter as usually I need to prepare some materials for the meeting. The only working area that is well lit is the working table using a desk lamp. There is no night lamp so if you can‚Äôt sleep in total darkness"
"KLIA Express from the airport in 30 minutes then walk to the hotel without getting wet in 10 minutes. Modern hotel, great buffet (especially weekends). the rooftop bar is a nice treat one night and the management and staff are very accommodating. I If you are here for work or pleasure then it is a great cost effective alternative. Use the Sentral trains to go anywhere in the city or wander over to the 5 star hotels on the other side of the train station for good dining and bar options."
"Me, husband and our little one, we had dinner in Nook last Friday. It was a great dining experience as food was so good. Laksa Sarawak is highly recommended. I love the spaghetti aglio olio too. Yummy! Special thanks to Chef Ridzuan whom was attending us that night. Mr Mutu, the restaurant manager is also a very nice guy. Being so friendly and courteous, they both had assisted us throughout the night. Restaurant space concept is awesome. Overall service was good. We will definitely come back next time!"
"Great location, everything went well until I received the invoice in my email for rm5 ""parking charge"" that never took place which was mentioned in the invoice paid with cash. Found this to be very sketchy and unnecessarily. So hard to put this feedback to the hotel via email - so I posted here instead so the management team who review this can make the feedback website more accessible."
"This time I brought my entire family and open for 3 room which one of it is suite room. Thank you Rachel Y, for fulfilling my request with a compliment celebration cake and Aloft camp. My 3 nephew are very happy with it. With a huge full glass window , they saw a beautiful view of KL , train pass by, car etc.  Aloft KL always being my 2nd home since 2013"
