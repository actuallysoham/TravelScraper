"My family and I recently booked 4 rooms at the Sunway Putra Hotel in KL for a short staycation at this gorgeous facility to just get away from the daily grind of home life. I must say it was the best idea we had in a long while. All of us (8 of us in total) had a blast there. The hotel is magnificent and grand. The rooms are refurbished, large and very clean and best of all the staff at this hotel are all amazingly friendly and helpful. Each and everyone of them - but two people stood out for me and that is Mr. Syamim from Front Desk and Ms. Komathy from F&B (Coffee House). They went beyond the norm of service to ensure that my family and I and all the other guests there were happy and well taken care of.   Sunway Putra hotel is superbly located in the heart of the city and is"
"Went for a family trip and had a wonderful time. Rooms were large, clean and comfortable. Hotel staff made us feel super welcome and at home. Scrumptious food too. Special shout out to Syamim for making our experience even more pleasant. We're already planning our next trip!"
Hi i had a very good stay and was given really great service by the whole hotel staff. Syamim at front desk was very helpful and polite. The food here was amazing too with a lot of great choices in the buffet. Would come again.
Found lots of shaved hair in the sink and was grossed out. The towel smelled mouldy too. Good thing is the bedsheet has no funny smell! N the staff were the friendliest ppl I‚Äôve ever met!! Building is old too and could use an upgrade.
It was a great stay. At night we can go to sunway putra mall watch movie (tgv) just walk thru the building. The room was great & bfast is ok. The promo voucher stay kawtim makan makan was a great deal ever.
"First of all , l would like to express my gratitude thank you to Dilla, Ms Siti Hajar, Ruby, shervin , zarina , malar for a excellence tip top service from my check in time till when my check out time everything was perfect without any failed, the room was superb amazing view of twin tower klcc with free upgrade floor ,might be coming back again to SPHKL ,really appreciate . The breakfast was a lot of choices last but not least keep it up guy's"
"I was make room reservation and checking the room price  directly to Sunway Putra Hotel reservation department on 25/03/201 for 02/04/2021-04/04/2021 (2 nights) via email, the staff (Devi) was replied RM255 nett per night with 2 breakfast, she request me to confirm and proceed. On 02/04/2021, I was check-in to Sunway Putra Mall, receptionist told me the price is RM530.40 for 2 nights, I was like...WHAT? Not RM255 nett x 2 nights= RM510.00?? Receptionist called Devi to confirm, Devi told me their hotel room stay rate is daily basis and she asked is it long time ago I make the reservation?? Hello..I'm make reservation on 25/03/2021, today 02/04/2021..long time ago???? She told me I only need to pay extra RM20.40 not more..Excuse me..not the problem of extra RM20.40 but why didn't"
"I bought the Stay Kawtim Makan Kawtim Package in June 2020 only to stay in the hotel in March 2021 because of MCO. It's not the hotel's fault. Check-in was a bit hectic because of an event in PWTC; a lot of people checking in and out. Lines were long. But I went for lunch as soon as I got there. 2 hours later, my room was still not yet ready. I booked for a Deluxe Suit, because of the long wait, they upgraded my room to Family Room instead! Yeay! Thanks SPH!   The buffet was great! The Mee Kari was unforgettable! I wish I had more room to stomach that Mee Kari! Haha! Will definitely be back for that Mee Kari. The Western Breakfast was my daughter's favorite. The staffs were very accommodating for a family with little ones like me.   I like that they followed the SOP in using the"
"A great hotel. A highlight is the humongous buffet breakfast and proximity to the Sunway Putra mall. However beware of booking one of the windowless rooms (their cheapest) and don‚Äôt expect much of the pool, which is too small for anything but wading."
We already stay here third time in the space of 3 months. The reasons? Its almost perfect in every aspects. And whats make its more perfect is the hospitality from all the staffs here are very top notch. The food selections are really excellent and the cleanliness is second to none.Kudos Sunway Putra Hotel!
"Its our 2nd time in SPH, to celebrate my mom birthday. Thanks to Asyraf for the room upgrade to next category. Staff very helpful and friendly from the reception to concierge team. Room is clean and spacious. Except the bathroom door is difficult to close and we request to have extra blanket and its was torn in the middle. Overall is great experience staying in Putra. They serve a buffet for breakfast and for the pool,make sure you call the Operator to book the slot. Easy access to the shopping mall and complimentary parking for inhouse guest."
"Always our business trip choice of hotel, Clean rooms, friendly staffs, restaurants just nice good service from waiter. Impressed by vivid situation how they maintain. sanitizer  of mask & disposable bed sheet + pillow case. Good for staycation too. Thank you definitely we will come back soon!"
"Great room, great package (unlimited makan), spacious room, and clean. Connected LRT station. The food was great, not a high end selections, but the taste is good. Definitely a very great place to have a weekend getaway!"
"Double thumbs up for all the staff. They very helpful, friendly and well trained. Management should be proud having them as employees.   Credit to Mr. Izam also, he was very helpful and has good personality. I really appreciated that he help me weighing my 4 pcs luggage even its late night."
Pro 1) location is in the heart of KL 2) Room is very spacious 3) There is a mall just below the hotel and very easy access 4) Staff was really friendly  Cons: 1) Not so much ATM machine available even at the mall 2) Pool was quite dirty as there is a lot of dry leaves when I enter. 3) Check in proses was not very smooth
"I've stayed at this hotel for a few times because i just loved that it is located next to the putra mall. Its very convenient and the LRT access are just walking distance. Great stay in KL and if you're not planning to drive around.  The room is very comfortable, spacious with everything you need in the inside, the decoration is simple and nice. The staffs were amazing.   However, i would say that the check in process took longer than my last visit to this hotel. I was asked to move to another counter then another counter by the staff. And this does not make a different at all if i were to stay at the previous counter. Also just a little concern in regards to the room amenities - one of the mug has lipstick stain. Perhaps this could be avoided in future.  I am looking forward to"

"A sincere smile is the ""Antidote"" to all ""Grief"". That is what I can translate My heart when every time I visit the Sunway Putra Hotel and meet the handsome princes and beautiful princesses (Staff Sunway Putera Hotel) Congratulations to Shervin, Asyraaf Zulkifli, Zarina and many other employees whose names I do not remember them. The Beauty and Cleanliness of the Hotel is further enhanced by the appearance of professionally trained and descriptive staff.

He is great value for the company.
"We (my sisters & I) had a pleasant stay for 2 days 1 night on 26th Sept 2020 although the hotel and our home is like 15 minutes away. Since the pandemic is still on going, the hotel follows the SOP by greeting us (check our temperature and all that) and only allow for 1 person to register at desk. (Thumbs up). I spoke to Mr. Hazim and he is kindly enough to upgrade our room and we had smooth check in.    The room was clean, neat and spacious. We requested several things from housekeeping and I'd say I am impress with their fast service. They also called us to check whether we received our items.   We were informed that we need to booked for Swimming pool and gym and allocated for 45 minutes per session. We booked at 11am, 27th Sept. I forgot to ask the staff's name who attended"
Hotel room is nice and spacious. Food is great and with comfortable surrounding. We had Syamim and Suraj at the front desk who provided excellent customer service. My family and I had great time and highly appreciate all the hotel's staff.

Good services & friendly ;) So far, this is my favourite hotel in KL.   almost  a couple of every month i stayed here.   Thanks, Sunway Putra! For the Excellent Services!ü§ç"
"First time staying in this hotel. Location is good (very near to city centre), next to the LRT station and I can travel to everywhere either by LRT or Grab. I like the room as it is really spacious and comfort, staffs are all friendly and approachable. The mall beside the hotel has many restaurants which makes us more convenient whenever we want to find stuffs to eat. However, one thing i don;t really like is there is no eating place for breakfast since all restaurant opens at 10am, this force me to take a breakfast in the hotel if I do not want to go other further places for breakfast.  Overall, i love the hotel room and location. I will choose to stay in this hotel again if I travel to KL again with my family."
"This is my 3rd time repeating to stay at the same hotel. After arrival, i checked in without hassle as my booking was done through agoda. The staff were very friendly and greeted me with humbleness. I was overwhelmed when customer service told me my room was upgraded from superior to deluxe without charge. The room was clean, the toilet too. During pandemic, they were very cautious and provide safety measures to ensure our safety and at the same time enjoying our staycation. My room package came with breakfast. The foods were nice. And there were many options to choose with. Thank you Sunway Putra. Probably will come again because it has easy access, easy parking and connected to sunway putra mall too. That makes my stay easy and convenient as there are many facilities provided"

"For the KAWTIM promotion, you get to have lunch, high tea and dinner on the day of your arrival and breakfast on the day of your departure. Be ready for a full-packed stomach but never mind, you could visit the gym or the pool to lessen your guilt. The staff were all friendly, with their eyes smiling. If there is one thing that they can improve, I guess that will be to get rid of the smoky smell which will be left on your clothes after visiting the ""Eggs Station"" during breakfast hour. Overall everything is good! You got to shop downstairs at Sunway Putra Mall or you can jump into a taxi and get to KLCC or Pavilion in below half an hour time!"
"The room was amazing, and just nice for a short gateway. The food was amazing and we join the KAWTIM promotion and it was so good because we can eat for almost 4 courses, lunch, tea, dinner and the next day breakfast."
Stay on 5-6 August for business trip. Overall the hotel is so nice after their renovation. Mordern and clean.

"Hotel staff are friendly, from the reception lady to housekeeping lady. The room condition is great and everything still looking new. Location is good and PWTC LRT station is 2-3mins only by walk. There are covered link bridge to Sunway Putra Mall and you can walk from the Mall to hotel also. The mall is just beside the hotel and linked to each other, therefore there is no problem for food and shopping. Stayed here during the Covid-19 period and hotel has limited housekeeping and facilities to use. The pool is closed but the gym is opened by appointment. However, this is for the safety for all guests and staff. Although you may need to call and ask for housekeeping, but the housekeeping lady still come to ask in the morning if you are in the room. If you not making request, she"
