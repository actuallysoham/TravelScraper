"Made an enquiry regarding their dining promotion recently after seeing it on their FB page. Calls to the specific number and email went unanswered so I proceeded to Whatsapp them. The person handling the Whatsapp had NO IDEA what I was talking about and could not answer any of my queries. I had to screenshot the promo on their FB page to show her. She didn't reply after that. I called the Majestic main line, the lady who answered the phone was rude and directed my call straightaway to the restaurant without a word.  I have been to the Majestic multiple times for staycations and dining before COVID and they were all excellent, until now. Looks like COVID and MCO wiped out their customer service as well."
"Checked in this hotel for a staycation celebrating my husband's birthday. I've been to this hotel couple of times for meeting & functions but this is my first time staying in as a guest. I'm overall very happy with the stay in this beautiful heritage hotel. The architecture of this building is beautiful & it is so rich in history. This stay brought me down the memory lane while I walked through every part of the hotel. We were also fortunate to meet Encik Sharezal, the Director of Concierge who offered us a tour around the old Majestic Wing. We would like to compliment him for being very warm, friendly & hospitable. Looking forward to return as a guest!"
One of the most beautiful hotels in Malaysia. Please visit this property!  We stay for 2 nights and the experience was amazing. Just want to give a big shoutout to Noah from the front desk. He was very patient with my concerns and very professional.   The lounge is close (due to pandemic) but they do provide room service evening cocktail which i thought was very nice.   Breakfast on a weekday is ala carte buffet and they have one of the best hotel coffees around!  Overall it was a perfect staycation. 9.5/10
"Me and my friend made a last minute booking for our staycation last week. We wanted to try it out and I must say we are happy with the experience. Understand weekends are peak time, we had to wait in queue for almost 30 minutes but that was fine since we understood it was weekends and school holiday. The reception staffs were all helpful and was calm despite it was chaos at the lobby area. Special mention to Sudhir the security stationed outside, I asked for a mineral water which I understand only available in the room or else need to purchase but Sudhir went the extra mile to go in and got me a mineral water even after telling him I don‚Äôt need it anymore. His action took me by surprise. Please convey my special thank you to Sudhir and all The Majestic Kuala Lumpur associates ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"We took advantage of the weekday promotion with breakfast and stayed for 4 nights. The breakfast was great but due to the Covid Pandemic, it has to be staggered to avoid overcrowding. The breakfast is great and with ample selection. Since only 2 time slots allocated, the wait time for breakfast can be a bit long. Maybe if there are 4 time slots of 1 hour each may help to cut down peak waiting time. The room was clean, comfortable and safe. The staff were great, very helpful, responsive and courteous. There were minor housekeeping issues but was speedily resolved by Duty Manager (Encik Hasli) and Housekeeping Manager (Puan Adi). The pool is nice too. Location is great, near to many tourist attractions and public transportation hub. For those who enjoy morning or evening"
"The hotel is very nice. We got ourselves the Junior Suite. The room is big and comfy. Fancy toilet with bathtub and tv.  The people are friendly. They hospitality is 5 star but the check in process is 0 star rating.  However, the poor check in procedure is a major let down. I was in the queue for 2 hours since my requested checkin time at 4 PM (manage to get myself registered at only at 6PM), just to learn my room is not ready for the next 2 hours.  I was compensated with dinner voucher. The front desk guy was very patient with a hot tempered guy like me. I am sorry for him.  More about the room  Junior Suite with King Bed  Cons 1.The couch is stained and there are some corners of furnitures are dusty. 2. TV is too small to enjoy from the bed. 3. No snacks or fruits provided 4."
"I initially booked with their sister hotel (Hotel Stripes) but was relocated to Majestic Hotel as Hotel Stripes remain closed despite that they accepted the booking. The e mail informing me of the relocation was rather last minute 1.5 days prior to departure. Needless to say this little incident was rather unsatisfactory as we made plans around Hotel Stripes (restaurant bookings within the vicinity that is walking distance) and being left in the limbo at the eleventh hour.   However Natasha Kok from Majestic's reservation did an excellent job in pacifying me and sorted out the room confirmation and ensuring that i was provided with the room and dining privileges on par with what i booked with Hotel Stripes. In fact, i would like to commend that she went above and beyond and"
Not sure how to feel about the RM70 nasi goreng. was hoping for a better presentation /taste if im paying that much. The chicken i swear is preheat kfc chicken and the nasi goreng is from across the street. so better Majestic
"The ambience and hospitality was delightful, we had a small issue with the junior suite as the door handle made it difficult to lock but the management was accommodating and offered us the grand suite, the bath tub was big and it had a tv in the bathroom, bed and pillows were so comfy, location was strategic, spa was so relaxing and worth it. Thank you Majestic KL. Till we meet again üòä"
"On 5th March, we have enquired about organising a birthday celebration at the Colonial Cafe in Majestic Hotel on 13th March. Upon receiving their high tea menu, and taking into consideration that it includes the following items in the menu: Mille Feuille, Basque Burnt Cheesecake, Opera Cake, Florentine and Salted Caramel Eclair, we have decided to proceed with the plan and made a booking to have the high tea menu.  On 13th March, instead of being served as per the menu, we were served an assorted type of cakes and instead of receiving 5 different types of desserts, we have only received 4 types of assorted cakes and when we enquired about the type of cakes, it took numerous waiters to come by our table before they could provide an explanation on the type of cakes we were having"
"1. February and March 2021 has been very hot, and that calls for a staycation. My stay was upgraded to The Majestic KL as The Stripes remains closed.  2. Check-in took a little long. People took advantage to have a staycation since 6-7 March was the first weekend since MCO was lifted. The reception was fully staffed.  3. I was given a corner room. The room was very comfortable, and the bathroom was fantastic. I loved the standalone tub. However, not all amenities were provided. I had to call Housekeeping for face towels. The shampoo & bath gel still contain methylparaben.  4. That being said, the room was showing its age. A portion of the wallpaper had peeled off, and one of the mirror lights malfunctioned. The plastic portion of the lampshades are cracked, but it didn‚Äôt render"
"5stars hotel room which come with a big bathtub and tv in bathroom. Love the deluxe king room, but too bad can‚Äôt post the room video here. The breakfast selection is not many, but the quality is üëç and have nice decoration. Although nothing special on the swimming pool and roof garden, but the 5stars room definitely worth for the visit!"
CHECK IN: smooth & fast. from parking you need to change lift to go to the room. so need to pass by the reception.  ROOM: i requested for high floor room & facing city/ monorail. room are so spacious. seriously you wont regret it. i booked junior suite. from outside look like old white building but interior inside was superb. modern n classy. love the bed. love the sofa bed. got dining table.so many chairs inside the room. also got coffee machine inside the room (extra point). i love the bathtub. u can watch tv while bathing. i love everything about the room. this is 1 of my favourite hOtel to stay in KLüëç  FACILITIES: didnt have a chance to see around as staying in the room is better during covid. in january the pool still open n limited for 5pax if i'm not mistaken. u can book
"Our room was huge, with a study/work table, dining table, dressing table, sofa and daybed!  Superb value for the price paid.  We had our meals at the hotel.  The breakfast buffet spread at Contango, and lunch/dinner menu at Colonial Cafe were limited but sufficient nonetheless for us.  The only grouse we had was the long wait to check in.  We arrived at 3pm on a Saturday and only got our room at 8pm (seemed as though the whole of Klang Valley was also there for a staycation that weekend).  Staff said they would call when our room was ready but they never did.  They were not even apologetic about the unusually long wait."
"We stayed at the junior suite. It was really nice and spacious. Can‚Äôt fault anything, everything was lovely. Staff were courteous and helpful at all time. Everything went super well, just like our previous stay. Until, the time we wanted to book the pool. Understandable that we need to follow the SOP during this RMCO. But the management should be wary of some KIASU guests who just simply book slots but didn‚Äôt bother to turn up hence denying other guests opportunities to enjoy the pool. And given the limited space, why can‚Äôt the management allow those staying at the new wing to use the always empty pool in front of the spa. Afterall we are all paid guests under the same hotel. Why just want to reserve that pool for few guests who apparently don‚Äôt want to use it? Then came"
"I went on 3rd to 5th January 2021. When i called prior booking, i was informed that the swimming pool is open. But when i came, only 4 people at a time for 1 hour slot. It was hard to get the slot. Also the pool depth is 1.2m which is not children-friendly. Not advisable to go if you have small kids.   Breakfast buffet is not available until further notice. I stayed for 2 nights and i was charged rm14x3 days parking. When i asked the front counter staff, she said all other hotels also charge for parking.   Otherwise, the foreigner male housekeeping staff at level 8 did good job in cleaning my room. He was thorough in cleaning."
"This is our second time staying at The Majestic. We came back because the service was always excellent and also the rooms are spacious. Due to covid, the buffet breakfast selection is not as excellent as it was last year. But the service is excellent as always. The only downside was that they forgot inform us that we need to validate our parking daily. We stayed for 3 days and had to pay for 2 days parking due to this as we only stayed at the hotel and didn‚Äôt went out."
"We thoroughly enjoyed our 3D2N stay at this luxurious, colonial YTL hotel. We love its proximity to the Botanical Gardens ‚Äì easy access to lush, greenery despite being in busy, busy KL.  Our room was spacious and grand from all points. We were especially impressed by the bathroom ‚Äì with beautiful black marble flooring and a lavish bath-tub set in the middle facing the TV.   Our stay had breakfast included. On Sunday it was buffet breakfast with quite a wide selection of choices. On Monday it was ala-carte . But portions were big. We made friends with Chef Zaidi. His nasi lemak with rendang chicken is a must-try. The hotel has a beautiful Orchid Conservatory where we could have had afternoon tea but we did not book in advance. Sigh.  Another time perhaps. Due to MCO we opted not"
"We stayed at The Majestic on the last week of Dec 2020, between Christmas & New Year. Despite being a weekday, the hotel was almost fully booked, which is great to see for business, especially during these trying times.  The check in process was smooth, although long queue. Front desk employee Phoebe (i think) was nice & accommodating. It was a pleasant experience.  The room was nice & beautifully decorated, although starting to show signs of aging. Room 511 has some floor tiles in the bathroom which are broken, but thats not really a big deal. In general, we were happy with the condition of the room. The beds & pillows were comfy and provided us with sound sleep, which is great.  Being a colonial hotel, the place (especially the Majestic Wing) has lots & lots of photo-opp"
"-Very smooth and fast check in/out on weekday. Less than 5 min. -Swimming pool need to book because only 3 people per pool per hour. -Afternoon tea only available on weekend. The Orchid room only available on weekend. Quite disappointed for cant try the high-tea.  -Big, spacious and room. Love the bathtub.  -Very near ( walking distant ) to KTM.  -Looking forward to come back to stay and try out the afternoon tea at the orchid room - Very good SOP, all the staff wear mask and never take down or put on the chin."
"Stayed two nights. Travelling with one child. Sofa already in the room. For the hotel to provide bed sheet, blanket and pillow, charge us RM165.00 per night!!!! A real rip offüò° No towels in the room when we checked in. Pillows were too soft. Mini fridge not cold at all. Breakfast had a long queue for the food, quality was ok only. As a guest you have to pay for parking- RM14 per dayüò±  Other room facilities were fine, clean and comfortable. Pool was nice and warm."
"I was soo looking forward to stay in Majestic since forever, and I was able to do it today since they got pretty good offer. However, I have been experiencing dissapointing experience from the start. The check in was so bad that I had to wait in Q for almost an hour, and come on, not even a welcome (or apology) drink or something?   After came in the room, we were welcomed by an annoying humming sound came in from somewhere that I had to call downstairs to check it out, turn out something related to their piping issue. Only 1 towel and no floor mat in the room, again need to call them to send it in.   We came straight from Johor Bahru and was starving and we decided to try their in-room dining service since its Majestic right? Oh my God, it was the worst decision ever! Not only"
I am a Platinum Elite Marriott Bonvoy member and I was asked to join the queue which is very long. Very disappointing experience. Waited for 30 minutes and still waiting. I‚Äôve asked two staff at the check in counter and I was told the same thing. No special check in for Platinum Elite members and have to join to queue.  I don‚Äôt understand the hotel management rationale for this. They might as well don‚Äôt join Marriott group.
"Look like no improvement by the team. When I try to show my BonVoy status, the reply is ‚ÄúJust Que Up‚Äù. No privileges treatment given. First time such treatment under BonVoy, perhaps BonVoy shall look into this on all YTL Hotel. I can‚Äôt imagine to checked a guest take 10-15 minutes. With que of 5, I may need one hour. Why can‚Äôt there is early preparation?  A weak management on check in and reservation department."
"Got a room for 1 night and luckily I came early for check in. The lines were long and maybe management can do something with the long waiting for check in. Got my room key and the room was what look like unfinish to me. There was oily stained in the fridge with a terrible smell. The toilet floor also look like half-heartly cleaned. Feel sticky on the floor when I step on it. The room was not properly cleaned as I found toothpick under table lamp. Seriously. There were no towels too so I call the room service and rectify these issue. They came and clean the fridge brought the towel. I also request for extra blanket from through the Marriott apps but none of my request being fulfilled. So I call the service once, twice and trice but nothing was sent. I did address this issue after"
"We have always wanted to have our staycation here in Majestic KL but never have never done so. So, on our special day (ROM at 12.12), we have decided to checked in into this hotel to make our day extra special.  Even though we arrived at the hotel rather late at 7pm , our room wasn‚Äôt even ready yet (check in time supposedly to be 3pm). Front desk staff promised the room to be ready in 1.5 hours as the hotel was running at full capacity, shorthanded of housekeeping staff & coupled with their nice offer for late check out at 4pm.  After learning from other hotel guests (a group family) who has been waiting for more than 4 hours, we approached the front desk again & they needed another 1 hour (from initial 8.30pm delayed to 9pm). Therefore, we have decided to head out to grab some"
"We stayed for a night and will unlikely return to stay at this hotel. Checking in was a nightmare. The receptionist was totally unhelpful when we wanted to book a slot for the pool. Said it was fully booked, but after we asked repeatedly for her to check, a slot at 8pm was suddenly available (means she didnt check when we initially asked?). We ordered food from Grab (bcs we had an inkling the dine in service would be poor judging from the check in service) but we requested for some plates and cutleries. The plates were only delivered after 2 HOURS and about 10 follow up calls, which was absolutely ridiculous that it took so long just to send up some empty plates! The pool was empty so not sure why the receptionist said it was fully booked, and there was no personnel there to"
"Imagine 100 ppl lining up to check in at 3PM like in Pudu bus station. After standing in line for 30 mins, the front counter tells you the room is not ready, and when asked what time the room will be ready, all you get is ""we will call you later, so sorry, just wait"". Apparently they were going to make me wait 2 hours.   Secondly, booked a junior suite however at check-in was told the booking was for a standard room. After showing the reception that the price paid was indeed for a suite, all they could say was ""take it up with your booking site"".  Never returning to this crap hotel. How can a simple check-in process be so bad to actually make a guest leave? The worst thing is everyone working seems to find the entire situation acceptable."
"The check in process took us from 230pm - 4pm and we had to wait until 8pm for our room to be ready. THAT IS A TOTAL OF 6 HOURS WAIT TO CHECK IN WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS BECAUSE WE HAVE A BABY WITH US AND THE RECEPTION MENTIONED THAT THEY WILL CALL US WHEN THE ROOM IS READY BUT WE DID NOT RECEIVE A SINGLE CALL. In the room, the wardrobe lights were not working, the pillows on the bed were not arranged nicely (it is as if housekeeping just throw it on the bed), the sinks were BOTH dirty with black water stains mark and the bathtub is also dirty. We called housekeeping and they arranged someone to come and clean the bathtub for us. And after that, we realized that the toilet seat was also dirty with dead insect bodies stuck onto the toilet seats. I would not imagine a hotel"
"Booked package for junior suite, come with spa, wine, breakfast and late check out at 4pm @ myr 425++, really a good deal during pendamic time.  Arrival experience was averages, the receptionist seems new to me, like intern maybe, there was senior stand beside and guide her to do the job. Apparently, she did not explain in the details of my packages, just told me room is not ready at 1pm, no suggestions were given. Then, I asked if i can use the spa first, since i bought the deal, she was blur then went back to office to get help. After i got the key later at 3pm, no explaination on where to get the lift up to the room. I suggest training needed for Front Office staffs. I assumed the room will be spotless clean, since they insisted on check in time at 3pm, even tough i came on"
"Booked high tea for two people in the drawing room. It is more expensive than the Colonial Cafe, but the ambience is so much worse. No background music, leftover crumbs on the floor, and no person greeting you at the entrance. You‚Äôll have to wait a million years to try and get attention from the service stuff. I understand that budget cuts have been made across the hotel industry, but this was just an insult.   Honestly, I‚Äôve received a lot better service in a mamak. A painfully overpriced lunch experience."
"Recommend by one my friend to try the massage in At majestic , definitely won‚Äôt be regret to come over here , very classy environment and relaxing , moreover I definitely should mention the therapist were so professional and helpful and listen the my preferences, can‚Äôt wait to make the next reservation at the Spa again and Kudos to the Therapist Ishta ! Will be back again :)"
"We stayed in a junior suite which was on offer with some perks. Room is nice a plenty of space. The bathroom is mainly occupied by the bathtub in the middle which leaves little room for the rest, but if you like to take a bath with TV... Our major problem was the breakfast. Service was painfully slow an un attentive. Due to covid there was only a small counter with juice, fruit and pastries. Toast was on special demand (!!!) and didn't come with even the western plate. We didn't notice this juice counter and asked for a juice which was reluctantly brought to our table. The hotel cannot expect guests to return to this same restaurant for lunch or dinner after such a bad experience."
"Check-in was okay, staff didn‚Äôt explain much about the facilities that can be used during CMCO and when I asked which eateries are opened, it was not answered, it left me a little clueless -which is quite surprising for a five-star hotel.   Upon check in, I was told that housekeeping service is only available upon request. Hence, I interpreted this as, unless I request for the service, otherwise, no one will come over to clean my room. However, I guess the housekeeping team is really eager to do their job üòÇ despite mentioning many times that I do not need housekeeping service, they never failed to show up, ring my doorbell 4 mornings during my stay -which I take it as a miscommunication between front desk and housekeeping.   Colonial cafe‚Äôs food is not that great, while I"
Managed to experience this hotel on September after checking out from ritz carlton KL. A short staycation over the weekend.   I was greet by a friendly bellman and receptionist. My apologies I couldn‚Äôt remember the name. Room given was super spacious and clean except the bathroom where i found it wasn‚Äôt clean enough anyway I love the fancy bathtub with the tv tho!   I couldn‚Äôt resist The pool. It was amazing. Generally a lovely stay. Thanks to all staff for providing great customer experience. Well done!
"Booked a room for a night stay for my mum. She loved it no issue at all . Room was perfect, quite spacious. I liked the dry bathroom: the bathtub with TV (even I didn't use it at that time). The pillows were too soft and not to my liking. I would definitely recommend you to come but maybe not for me. I have a trypophobia and the bathroom tiles all with a pattern of small holes. Almost all of the time I took my shower or doing ""business"", I didn't even want to look at the wall and it was stressing me. I was looking forward to have the buffet breakfast but unfortunately I was told by the front desk team that it only ala carte was available atm, which disappointed me."
"I checked in on October 10th for one night. Very disappointed. There was no one to help me with my luggage to my room and I had to carry it up to my room myself. I ordered room service for dinner and was told to pay immediately, rather than sign for it. The room service menu was very limited. Only 7 items. There was no room service at all for breakfast. Certainly, not 5 Star service. More like a budget hotel."
I accompanied my friend to.Kuala Lumpur and we stayed at the majestic Kuala Lumpur and this hotel is by glory is exactly like it's name - majestic! It is very well proportion and the service is well very very very very good.
"My partner and I checked into Majestic Kl on a Friday as they had a stay and dine promotion.  Room was good, service was good. And the room came with a buffet dinner for two at contango followed by buffet breakfast in the morning.  Definitely worth it for a night stay :)"
"Me and my partner stay regularly at YTL hotels in Malaysia and The Majestic is one of our favourites. It has struggled since covid-19 restrictions to regain some of the quality service we used to experience but it is certainly improving.   We stayed in a grand suite this time and were very impressed with the room layout and size. Although parts of the hotel are still closed and there are limited menus available, the general feel of the hotel is regaining some of its colonial 5* charm and is far improved considering RMCO and SOP restrictions.   The staff at The Smokehouse were excellent as always and very attentive to our needs. We also enjoyed the Contango buffet in the evening which still has a wide range on offer despite changes to the buffet service.   Overall, we were very"
"Booked the junior suite and was happy with the overall stay. Good amenities and the team was nice. Some feedback about parking is that its chargeable at Myr14, can use touch and go or any pay wave card. Overall great stay"
The name says it all - a magnificent hotel! A superbly designed foyer/reception area. Classy rooms/suites & authentic look. Concierge team were really helpful and friendly. Breakfast was top-notch as well. Majestic experience for sure!
"We had two nights here due to failure of the water supply to our nearby house. Should have awarded a five star review but when we moved into the room there were a couple of hairs on the sofa. Never acceptable, least of all during a pandemic. Apart from that everything was great. Only one restaurant plus room service available but what they did they did well. Lovely old hotel with very well trained staff. Recommended."
"Has been yearning to return to this beautiful hotel since last visit. With the ongoing promotion , there‚Äôs no reason not to plan a return stay. Beautiful as usual despite the sop in placed. Had the opportunity to try the afternoon tea this time, delicious food, but service a little bit slow as there weren‚Äôt many staffs on duty.  Room is great with good bath tub. Lady on the i centre is very helpful and accommodating. Concierge guys are helpful.  A minor glitch is the guy at the check in counter Ron. A little bit more attention is necessary as he repeatedly mixed up my details both during check in and check out, despite holding on to my identity card and need reminders to provide voucher , getting bonvoy points etc. Not an usual experience with Ytl. Probably there‚Äôs an understaff"
"We wanted to have a staycation over the weekend but the hotel really made me disappointed.   The hygiene and cleaning were not the best actually it was the worst. When we checked in, all the tables were covered with full of dust. The gaps between on phones were dreadful. When I cleaned them with wipes, I could see black dust all over. I just cleaned by myself.   The toilet bowl was ABSOLUTELY disgusting. Only middle of the toilet bowl has been cleaned for a long time, the side/edge of the toilet bowl was completely black, layered with pooh basically. I called the housekeeping and she tried to clean it with a towel. I told her she needs cleaning tools and some kind of liquid and she went to get them. She still cleaned the toilet bowl in the middle only and I had to point out the"
"Came here for a night stay. Unfortunately paid extra compared to others as we didn‚Äôt realise there a package and offers. Future travelers please check the website and available promotions.  The hotel it self is wonderful. Check in check out was fast. Lobby was clean. Just one concern when we came there the bell boy passed us without offering to even carry our bags. In the end we had to carry it all the way to 9th floor but it‚Äôs ok.  The parking:  Vallet parking : Rm 40 per day ( acceptable ) Normal hotel parking ( Rm 14/ day- cashless , only touch & go ( min rm 20 balance you should have in the card, and also received credit card and debit cards) - unacceptable as it‚Äôs the hotel parking and should gv discount or a flat rate or even free for staying in guest. Imaging if you wanna"
"We checked into the hotel on Monday and left on a Wednesday. The check in  service was good and efficient.  We booked a suite for ourselves and a twin bed for the kids, so everyone had enough space.  Breakfast and dinner was at the colonial cafe and all meals were served in bento.  My stay was marred by the loss of my earpods which I left in the room and they were missing after we came back. My own fault for not locking them in the safe.   The second issue is how slow the breakfast was on the second morning. I understand there were probably short of staff but the service while good, was slow.    Will definitely go back again."
"We returned to Majestic Hotel Kuala Lumpur to reward ourselves with a staycation within the city. We had an amazing time there 2 years ago and it was our first choice when we wanted to go for this staycation. However, we were a bit disappointed laa..   1. Parking - changed to cashless parking. RM14 per day (multiple access but need to be validated at the reception before exit). However, if you exited and your TnG balance is less than RM20, you cannot re-enter .... really inconvenient. And imho, stay in guest should not even have to pay RM14 parking fees.. so low class wei ..  2. Room upon entry very nice.. but towels got stains, bath tub not cleaned properly. I have to clean it up before use (takut mah) ..   3. No buffet breakfast but understandable because of the Covid"
"Dine in to Colonial Cafe for dinner and was disappointed at their slow service and attentiveness. It takes about 30 minutes for them to clear the bento (we had to prompt the waiter) and takes another 20 minutes to serve the dessert after clearing. Dessert came together with coffee , and A spoon ( to be used for cake and coffee?)   As for their ‚Äú5 choice selectors‚Äù - Presentation of the food is definitely worst than a restaurant. Serving bento set ? Oh man, worst place to pick for birthday celebration.   Room was fine except they had wedding on going and the music and speech from the event can be heard clearly and loudly from the room. Sound proof is terrible and should have not put your guest at the room near to the event space if there is an event on going. ( we were placed"
"With Wednesday to be a day of no power at my condo, I decided to go see the Majestic Hotel.  I even asked a friend to join me for lunch. The website is nice...and ONE restaurant, the Colonial Room, had a link to a menu, very helpful...very appealing.  However, Contango had no link.  I called to enquire....""Our Operators are busy...please hold.""  Hello, Operator....Front Desk please...can I help you.... front desk please.... Hi can you tell me what you want...Front Desk please.... Front desk reached...no answer.  Hang up, called about 5 times, leaving my call hack number, asked for the concierge....""Not available""...How about Contango...sorry no one able to assist you there.""  Took my number also.  By 4pm, trying to make a lunch reservation for Wednesday seemed 1) annoying...2)"
"I have honestly stayed in majestic couple of times and thought it will be great to come back again for a birthday celebration. Little did I know, because of MCO, majestic have turned their buffet breakfast into alacarte (with only asian or American choice) in a BENTO BOX! Seriously! Who puts american breakfast in a BENTO Box? I was not notified at all of the change of breakfast ( from buffet to a bento box) prior to coming. I was only informed upon checkin, and I told them it‚Äôs not a fair choice for me to be paying buffet breakfast price for an alacarte american breakfast in a BENTO BOX! This was not I signed up for. Had I known about it, I would‚Äôve gone for the room without the breakfast. The staff told me to take it up to agoda instead! Because I have booked the room via a"
"Hello from your disappointed guest, kindly read my points below: 1) The hotel provided an upgrade to us for our stay(Colonial Suite) which I think not bad - for a first impression :) 2) Checked-in, the room is big and nice. However, me and my wife found that the quilt has some sort of moldy smell. I thought 5 star hotel would have quality checks on every room thoroughly. 3) Be careful, the Hotel has ‚Äòhidden charges‚Äô - the parking rate. To be honest, we didnt know that the parking rate is rm14 for 24hour and we thought that rm14 is one-off charge by the Hotel. I believe the hotel didnt mention about its parking (hidden charge) on its website, or perhaps it is somewhere which im unable to find (my dear hotel team, please give the link related to parking rate if you have, I can use"
"Not up to high class hotel standards. Saw a housekeeping wore slippers walking past us, the lady server poured a breakfast coffee & spilled it on our table & floor without saying anything (let alone sorry) and not even wipe it off. üò≥ The ceiling was peeling. I know it‚Äôs an old hotel but it has lost its magic. I yet born during its era (colonial times) but expected the same pleasure but I left with frustration. Should have stick to original plan to stay in a newer hotel or Tower Wing (been there once & was happy) But I‚Äôm pleased with my last minute request to have afternoon tea and managed to get one (via Whatsapp) at Drawing Room. The Drawing Room‚Äôs lady server & behind official whatsapp were very kind & helpful. Thumbs up for them."
"Booked and checkd in via the marriott bonvoy app, hence the room is ready quite early. Hassle free check in.  However you can tell they are downsizing in terms of staff numbers due to the economic crisis.  The hotel lawn/garden looks unkempt and is totally neglected. The breakfast is served ala carte style with very limited choice. Had the nasi lemak bento which is quite disappointing.   But a huge complement needs to be given to the remaining staff who are an absolute champion. The same staff took care of the reception counter, serves breakfast and tend to everything in between.   Shoutout to Ms Wai Ting for your exemplary work ethics, i hope the economy recover soon and the majestic will restore it's former glory"
"Stayed there for one night. Got this as an anniversary gift from my sis in law. Stayed in the majestic wing ( classic ). Rooms were big with one hall leading to another bedroom. Dinner set there was great with good ambience and attentive waitress and waiters. But choice of a la carte and price could be better.  Bed and pillow was so very superb I think that was one of the highlights for me.  No more buffet breakfast so , felt like lack of choice. As it was served in a bento set.  Swim pool at gym level was not opened ( I wished it was as it will be a good thing to be able to dip in after a gym workout )  Receptionists at check in looked very junior and less attentive.  Syed was one who served us well and Syarizal was very friendly and professional to chat with. It was very nice"
"Booked the cheapest room at 350rm/night but was given the opportunity to upgrade to one of their club rooms at check-in for an extra 150rm/night. Upgrade was well worth it. Huge room in the original building with separate living room and a huge bathroom. We‚Äôve previously stayed in the newer tower wing but quite simply doesn‚Äôt compare.   The complimentary (for club rooms) ‚Äòafternoon tea‚Äô is limited compared to the Grand Hyatt in KLCC, serving a few pastries and that sort of thing. Big perk of the club rooms is the 24 hour check in/out period - perfect if you arrive late at night and want to leave late at night. Also the complimentary unlimited laundry is a big perk (completely took advantage of this and ended up getting a full two suitcases dry cleaned.)   The pool is pretty"
"I stay only for one night because i need a short gateway after work so hard since the pandemic disease.  First time when I came to this hotel, I was really confused when I enter the basement. They don‚Äôt have car parking ticket like other hotel does. You need to use your touchngo or your ATM card. check-in process was okay but they didn‚Äôt explained to me about the parking fees and I forgotten to ask about it until I went out to met my friend. The parking is chargeable at RM14 at your first exit with multiple exits. But you need to validate your card parking payment at the reception before your first exit. I never encounter this kind of experience before even Four Seasons hotel give free parking for their in house guest or guest that dine in in their restaurant.  My room is at"
"I visit Malaysia once to twice a year to visit family and Majestic hotel was by far my favourite hotel I‚Äôve stayed in! Usually I end my trip on my own and stay in a hotel and decided to try Majestic. Everyone was incredible. Check in staff, door staff and bar tenders were incredible. The lady who sang in the bar was outstanding, she had such a beautiful voice and played the piano so well! Thank you for the upgrade, it was the perfect way to end my trip and I‚Äôll certainly be back as soon as I can!"
"So classic place to chill n hang out.Dinner with friends at Colonial Restoran many choices of food, friendly and entertaining staff..(stacey&lina).thanks to all for wonderful service. Ualls make myday.Definately will comeback again.#staysafe"
"I‚Äôve booked a junior suite in tower wing and I have been told that it has ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù to the majestic wing which my partner and I thought that it is actually downgraded. I have invited my friends for my birthday celebrations and all of them found that it‚Äôs not worth as a suite and price. One of them was staying in the hotel as well, she said it‚Äôs totally different from what they got when they‚Äôre staying in the suite in Majestic last time.  Secondly, there‚Äôs no one to greet me for my birthday and there‚Äôs nothing happen during my whole stay. It‚Äôs totally unacceptable as for SPG standard. It means SPG members‚Äô profile is totally not worth for your crew to read it before or when your guest approach.   Third, the parking fee is hilarious. I‚Äôm totally understood that not in-house guest"
Misleading package for junior suite where hotel mention it includes breakfast but just come with a few pieces of bread and not able to accommodate simple ask of eggs or fried rice.  Suite condition needs improvement with obvious wallpaper and paint crack.
"Majestic Hotel review.   I stayed here for 3 days 2 nights with my Fianc√© last week. Initially,i would want to rate this below average,but right before we left the hotel,i would say the rating went from below average to BAD.   1. On the first day, upon arrival my fianc√© carried all of our luggages on his own. No hotel staff or bell boy offered to help him with it.I felt bad and ran over to give him a hand. 2. Upon arrival, i was told that there will be no breakfast spread as the hotel restaurants are closed. Imagine paying extra for breakfast only to be given this news. ( It should have been stated on their websites),or practise social distancing during breakfast at the restaurant. The restaurants were open for dining during dinner though. -so dinner is allowed but not"
We stayed 2 nites at Governor‚Äôs suite. Had an excellent time. It‚Äôs a Beautiful room and spacious. Great butler services!!! Plentiful choices at breakfast. Love the colonial touches throughout the hotel. Will definitely come back!
A lovely hotel. Fantastic room/ suite it was huge. Excellent staff couldn‚Äôt do enough for you. Loved the complementary drinks at five a lovely treat. Breakfast included - best coffee we had on whole two week tour. The hotel is close to the botanical gardens so has a bit more of a garden feel when compared to the traffic madness of downtown KL. Would recommend
"A charming colonial hotel. Recently renovated but the interiors are timeless, and luxurious without being overwhelming.  Had the best Nasi Lemak I had at a big establishment here for breakfast, complete with the Kerang and Sotong Sambals.   The afternoon tea was exquisite as well. If I really had to nit pick, the scones were a little hard. There is an option to have it in their Orchid Conservatory but reservations for that fill up weeks in advance"
"Love the room, the lounge, the service. We stayed at the straits room for 3 days 2 nights and it was so lovely.  Really love the room so we just decided to dine in the restaurant and ordered room services throughout the whole trip.  Miss the place and will definitely be back."
We have stayed here twice in the last two months.  The hotel is quite large but this does not detract from its attractiveness nor comfort of stay.  We had excellent service at all points - at reception where Rashid gave us good advice on a modest upgrade which enabled us to have a late departure. On both occasions we stayed in the old part of the hotel i.e. not the tower. Our rooms were very clean (thank you Awal for your help and excellent service) and well supplied and the upgrade gave us a free minibar with soft drinks and access to a lounge with happy hour plus. The hotel is within walking distance of the National Museum which is well worth a visit and it is a reasonable walk to Independence Square. We return to KL later this year and intend to stay at the Majestic again.
"My review is based on a deluxe room, with 1 king bed with a view.  I had a great stay at the Majestic where the staff were very helpful and friendly. The breakfast area was very spacious with a huge selection of delicious food. My room was excellent and big enough for a single person. The National Museum is located close by and the other sites are within a walkable distance (20 mins walk).  Only issue I could say is that, other guests rooms can see into yours. Also, due to the location of the hotel for dining options you have to travel a bit to find some (if not dining from the restaurant)."
"This hotel has a new, modern wing and a fully renovated colonial style, old building, where I stayed. The public spaces in the colonial building are nice but they lack a bit the  atmosphere that can be found in other colonial buildings and hotels around Asia. The suite I was upgraded to was comfortable, the only issue was the limited choice of TV channels available, (about 15 in total, including FOX news UK Bloomberg, National Geographic and Discovery, but lacking major news networks like CNN, BBC, Al Jazheera etc, as well as movie channels. Additionally the TV is not a modern, smart TV, so no YouTube and other internet channels. Breakfast buffet is a highlight, with multiple themed stations offering Malay, Indian, Chinese and all sorts of Western food, all excellent in taste."
"Me and my business partner had a 2 days stay at The Majestic KL, but the expectations were not met. We made a booking through phone and was informed that we would be given a free dinner upon 2 nights stay. But after checking in, the front of the house staff informed us that they do not have such promotions. We were not very well so we did not pursue the matter. The front of the house staffs most of them do not smile, not pleasant and we felt rather taken aback with their talking manner. We felt like we were getting in their way of work. Breakfast spread was OK, only staff Mei was pleasant, the rest was just working without smile. We did not enjoy the afternoon tea session as the person who sat us down were not friendly and they was he presented us with the seat, we felt like we"
"It was great stay in this hotel, Me and my friend's together for two nights everything was fine one more things I need to share with you that is your hotel don't have any ATM boots here Al's near the hotel, Otherwise the service was excellent including your restaurant as well.   We will try to our next visit this hotel......  Thank you!"
"The architecture and decor of the hotel are really quite a sight to behold. The experience feels otherworldly; taking a vacation here feels like a real vacation. Everything looks clean, well-maintained, and tastefully designed.   The room feels very, very grand. It‚Äôs probably one of the better looking hotel rooms I‚Äôve been in. It admits a lot of light, but the curtains contain the darkness very well when I wanted them to. The bathroom feels very special; it is spacious, and very well laid-out.  (None of the rooms in the hotel are smoking; however, my room smelled of cigarette smoke when I arrived. The attendant who tried to address the issue with air freshener told me that another guest might be smoking in their room, and the smell was wafting in through the air conditioner.)"
This is clever how they have managed to retain the character of the old hotel and bring it forward to a more modern age.  There is a lot of competion at this level at it was nice to stay somewhere which could be described as memorable.  We had come from the coast and were made very comfortable in a junior suite on the west side.  We had a lot of help from Felix at the Conciege Desk .  This enable us to fix the sightseeing in a short space of time. Oh when we arrived at great deal of trouble was spent of when we were leaving.  It was very important to make immediate contact with the firm collecting us three days later to take us to the airport at 6am. All very efficient. They even have minibus tranfers to take you to different parts of the city.  My wife really likes orchids and
"I‚Äôm sorry to write this and this is not a reflection on the staff who have been charming but, what a disappointment.  The pictures and reviews set my expectations high for my three day post flight pre resort stay but as I begin my final full day I can‚Äôt wait to leave.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong this place has charm but it‚Äôs lacking everything else that one would expect of a 5 star hotel!  I‚Äôm on the 10th floor, I was on the 12th but my room had a leak so I move.  Nothing wrong with that except for the smell.    Goodness this place needs a deep clean and could probably do away with in room carpets and replace or deep clean soft furnishings - marks and stains are unacceptable.  Throughly room smell which was unpleasant to the point where I had to get a plug in room freshener!!!  Did I"
"The Majestic is one of those large hotels that still seems to maintain personality. Everything about it was great, the service, the rooms and the food. Its position makes it a bit difficult to navigate your way around all of the roads that entwine themselves around it, if you are travelling on foot. It is, however, close to the MRT station which is almost certainly the best way of getting into the centre of KL, because the traffic is awful!"
Stayed for one night. Check in was quick and smooth. Upon settling down in the room I realized that there were some toiletries lacking but housekeeping was quick to send them over. The room was clean. Lightings and air-conditioning was perfect. TV had a good variety of channels. Bed was great. Overall service was too notch and hotel staff were very helpful. The breakfast spread was good however the quality of food especially the Asian cousine was a little disappointing. Also there is a parking fee of RM 15/day that is also applicable to in-house guest which is quite surprising as most hotels waive this fee for guests. Hope they can review this.
"We were surprised when we arrived to find such a large hotel. We were then taken to the old part which was much more like the hotel we expected. Our suite was perfect  and the club lounge area was  a lovely air-conditioned retreat for a quick coffee or cold drink when returning from our expeditions. The breakfast restaurant was large and busy but we always found plenty of food and good service. There are two pool areas a smaller one directly outside the spa area closest to the old part and a large roof top pool in the newer part, both were wonderful."
Stayed for 4 days 3 nights. Great customer service!  They have great vibes and atmosphere and clean room. Breakfast and lunch is amazing. Very friendly staff. Would recommend this to all. Overall it was an amazing experience.
"The room was lovely as pictured!  We had a corner room and the view was amazing!  Be aware that it can be difficult to get a cab or Grab if you plan on catching the 5:00, 5:20 or 5:40 KLIA Express. It was stressful when we were waiting for cab at 5:00 am and were unable to just walk due to the complex road system. We had walked there the long way the day before, but it was at least a half hour and very confusing!  Since traffic is so quiet at that time it perhaps would have been better to just order the cab the night before!  We had wanted the ""safety"" if the fast train.  Budget tip: There is a local train station directly across the street (a huge ornate building), it's only a few stops to the huge Mid Valley mall. Incidentally it would also take you to KL Sentral in less than"
"The Majestic blends modern day luxury with historic features. The lobby certainly has the wow factor!  I stayed for 3 nights in the tower, in a huge, modern room with a view of the pool. The bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom and had a shower and freestanding bath. I wasn't sure about the open plan design between the bedroom and bathroom, but there was a curtain!  Breakfast was a huge buffet with lots of choice, although the service could be a little slow at times. I also tried the evening buffet, and it had everything you could possibly want!  The hotel is conveniently located for public transport, near the main Sentral station. It is however on a busy main road which, as well as being noisy, isn't very pedestrian-friendly. The hotel operates a free half-hourly shuttle"
"Stay just one night but I like place . Is well located and hotel have everything what you need . Very friendly staff . Good food . Great aftenoon tea rooms , good size rooms,  well decorated . Need to be refreshed a bit outside plus pool area but part of that all great . Good value for money also . Very sorry I dont remember any names to mention but really all staff working there are well trained and customer orientated . Will like to visit again in close future"
"We stayed at the Majestic Hotel for a week from 17 to 24 January 2020. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, the original structure was built in 1932 and a large extension is beside the original building and completely in keeping. We were in Room 1110, a very large and comfortable room with a lovely view of a historic colonial building across the road, and out over the surrounding area.The building opposite houses the Asian International Arbitration Centre, and dates back to the 1930s. We enjoyed looking at the view, seeing the sun rise in the mornings and the lights at night. The location of the hotel is fantastic, it is set in a historic colonial area, walking distance to the National Museum, and to the National Mosque. Little India and China Town are a short distance away. The"
"Check inn service:  One word 5StarLuxury with High quality Standards. Neat & more spacious rooms with a Tropical & Colourful Twist. Breakfast is good. I do recommend everyone to stay at Majestic Hotel at Kuala Lumpur. You should experience it . I would like to personally thank the Front Office, Reservation and Food & Beverage  departments for reliable, loyal & hospitality and casual talented employees. One experience richer and smarter. Make it right' Be magnifique! I will be back soon. Thank u . Keep it up."
"What a great place to stay.  A walk, diagonally, across the road and you at the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station which provides easy access to places near and far.  The Hotel is two parts - the old building and the newer building.  We stayed in the newer one - o the 11th Floor, looking West, and down at the 3rd Floor swimming pool.  A magnificent room, with separate bath and shower - the bath had its own TV screen.  The room was the size of a small house.  It was well worth paying an extra surcharge for the Buffet breakfast each morning - all you can eat with a large selection of foods."
"Old, colonial style hotel with nice, modern rooms; I'm especially live their breakfast with wide spread both local and international cousin. In addition, the hotel is easily reachable from the Heart of the city - KLCC station."
"First class hotel with everything you need for a great city break. Comfortable lounges, jazz band playing and a bar with wonderful cocktails. It‚Äôs only a walk into the centre and a courtesy bus if you want it. The air con is a bit ferocious so do bring a jacket"
"The hotel, the room, the view was nice.  The colonial ambiance was nice but the hotel staff falls short in their customer care attitude, training and sophistication to make this hotel special.    Desk lamp in the room was broken and a whole new replacement had to be brought in.  Surprised that electric equipment was not checked as part of routine.   Could not get small change at front desk.  Asked if they had cashier before an attempt to get change.  We prepaid our room and was told that booking through an agent disqualify for Marriott Bonvoy which seems kind of strange but as we only stayed 1 night, really couldn‚Äôt bother to make a fuss.  We had a meal at their restaurant, lovely place with live music.  Our order of fish and chips came with 2 pieces of fish, one of which was"
"Currently staying at Majestic Hotel for a week in the Majestic wing. The hotel is simply top class, the staff across the board excellent and facilities A1. In particular the butler staff in the Majestic wing, all young, professional and very gracious. The complimentary afternoon drinks in the lounge are fantatsic as are the cocktails in the Smokehouse. A beautiful Colonial hotel and the only place in KL I stay whenever in town for business. I'll be back in a month and already look forward to it again. Try a Majestic or Governors suite, a great experience. Great in room morning coffee and and breakfast and excellent complimentary laundry service.  Coming from airport is simple, jump on the KLIA train to Sentral station and wait at arrivals for the half hourly Majestic shuttle"
"This hotel has very luxurious and spacious rooms, with excellent facilities. The wifi did drop out a little bit. The hotel is good for getting to The bird park and around that area. We found it very eady to walk to Panar Seni station, if you turn left out the hotel go past the Mosque and there‚Äôs a subway over the road, much safer then trying to cross the road. The train was 4 stops to KLCC and cost 210 rm. If you go in the opposite direction you have KL Sentral. The breakfast here had a lot of choice and although with the Chinese New Year the hotel was very busy but the breakfast choice wad running out if you got there later.  It took about 30 minutes to walk to the Chinese market which had a huge market and some good eating places. We did walk into KL centre which took an hour"
"First the good - clean, historic hotel with some lovely areas and some excellent staff.  so why won't I stay here again?  What appears to be a complete lack of management oversight and training as well as a complete disregard for customers comfort - some examples  1)  If you have status with Marriott (Bonvoy) you have to argue for the benefits the program describes (I had the exact same experience a year ago - no improvement and REALLY hard to get a manager)  Definitely not a good way to start a stay.  2)  People who answer the phone don't have an adequate understanding of English.  e.g.  I need someone to help with the electric outlet......response ""you mean you have a problem with the wash basin?""....no, repeat original request..... ""you mean there is water on the"
"Visit on a Sunday for liquor coffees and to sus out if it is a nice place to stay. It was very pleasant as Jane (concierge) showed us around the place. Nice and peaceful until the high tea punters poured in with screamimg kids joining in from the hotel residents. Must be good news for smokers as there is a smoking room/ bar as well. Having read the good and bad reviews from diners, i stayed away from the main dining room. Overall, it is a smallish hotel and retro in some areas (e.g. outdoor pool). I would return to stay."
"We have been regular guests in the Majestic Hotel over the past years. We are also Ambassador Elite members of the Marriott Bonvoy program. This time we stayed for appr. ten days, but then decided not to extend our stay beyond that and not to come back here for a long time for the below stated reasons.  The hotel is a beautiful merger between a time long gone by (old wing) and the modern days (new wing), staying true to its colonial heritage. Every single person at the concierge service (Mr. Mueller, as well as the gentleman with the transparent tortois-shell style glasses (Shazim???) and their entire team to be mentioned in particular), as well as in the breakfast area (in particular Mr. Imran and Mr. Ong) are fabulous.   HOWEVER, there are some serious deficiencies in the"
"When we first stepped into our room I was most impressed. We had the junior suite and it was beautiful and spacious. The staff were friendly and helpful and I felt that it would be a very nice place to spend the weekend.   Pretty soon however it became apparent that attention to detail was lacking which was a shame as otherwise it is a nice hotel. They were little things that annoyed us but should not occur in such a nice hotel... such as having only 1 bar of soap in the large bathroom with 2 sinks separated by a bathtub, or having only 1 shower cap which was not replaced the next day after use...  While the staff were friendly, initiative seemed to be lacking. We came down to take the hotel shuttle 2 minutes prior to the scheduled departure time and was told by staff that it"
"The room was super clean, comfortable and spacious with bathtub facility. Located in the best location of Kuala Lumpur City Centre. The food is excellent, the staff throughout the hotel are so professional and many unexpected touches that make The Majestic KL a very special place to stay‚Ä¶ highly recommended accommodation for business trip or holidays. I have stayed here regularly for some time and they never failed to surprise me with complimentary room upgrade, very attractive corporate rates for hotel booking and the greatest of all is the warm hospitality and personal touches extended by the hotel staff regardless of rank and positions especially to Mr. Jeffrey Mong, Mr. Sharezal Abdul Wahid and all the porters or bellhop, front desk, Contango staff, housekeepers and everyone"
"We checked in and found that the que was very long and there was alot of guests waiting to be check in. When my turn to do the check in the receptionist told us that the room was not ready and we need to wait atleast 2 hours for the room to be ready.   The staff offered us lunch while we were waiting for our room and since we are starving at that time, its nice to have lunch on the house.   Of all the hotels that i stayed, this is the only hotel that offer such treat to guests when their rooms are not ready and they know how to ""cushion"" our frustration. Kudos to the hotel.  For the record, this visit was not our first stay at Majestic KL. As usual rooms were perfect, staffs were friendly and all the things are perfect!"
Spent 4 days at this hotel . We stayed in the old part which is steeped in history back to a colonial time . The room was comfortable but was not impressed that there were no views to speak of . Could not even open the shutters in my room . Fortunately we spent little time in the room . Other family members stayed in the new part . These rooms were bright and spacious . Enjoyed the club lounge snacks and cocktails from 5 . Buffet breakfast was delicious with plenty of choice .  Need to get a taxi really to go anywhere .
"On arrival at he hotel, it was very impressive to be met by a lovely doorman in a fantastic uniform, who opened the taxi doors and greeted us with a smile. Check-in was fairly straightforward and quick. The room was large and spacious with plenty of room for our luggage, and plenty of seating. Generally, the room was clean although we noticed, when sitting on the sofa, a brown stain on the bedsheet - at least on the edge, so we were not lying on it (see photos). Another downside was the clear glass panel separating the toilet from the shower. It reduced the size of the toilet headroom which made it somewhat awkward when sitting on the toilet. Both of us had difficulties due to this limited headroom - and being clear glass, it is not easy to judge the space. The breakfast choice"
"Location wise it was great as the hotel was close to my customer. But not convenient for tourists.  Pros: once you enter the hotel, or the room, you do get the majestic feelings. I love it‚Äôs history and the building entrance. My room was stunning to walk into especially the bedroom. Open space was big enough to have friends over or even gave a meeting.   Cons: unfortunately more cons - never met such unfriendly/unhappy looking receptionist, restaurant waiters. I travel a lot for work so as much as I appreciate the grandness of a guest room, I look for practicality- bathroom was nice but no place to put your toiletries. When you have lots of cosmetics, space to put them is what you need. I‚Äôm not bothered about the quality of a tissue box but as you can see from my photo, needs to"
"As recommended by a friend who lived here we booked afternoon tea in the Colonial Cafe (not Orchid room) It certainly lived up to expectation. Excellent high tea, professional service, elegant surroundings and a relaxing alternative to the sightseeing and heat. Book in advance though."
"Spotlights: * Delicate Modern Interior Design. * Impeccable In-Room Lighting. * Chic Bathroom w/ Comfy Atmosphere. * Wide Variety of Buffet Breakfast, including genuine Malaysian gourmets. * It's originally a heritage site, so you may experience some retro feelings. * Convenient free shuttle van provides three routes, including KL Sentral. * Nearby two Stations, breathtakingly beautiful Middle Eastern architecture. * Highly recommend.  * I don't think of any disadvantages, actually.
