"Honestly this is one of the best hotel in town and worth for your money. Spacious,free and safe parking for car, comfortable room,very helpful and kind staff. I stay for 2 night and extend my trip for another 4 night. I will definitely come again."
"Love the enviroment, worth my money for 4 days and 3 night . I would come again here in the future. Also my would like my friends know about this hotel i like my room also the stuff there very polite and helpfull ."
"Very super value for money! Clean environment and friendly staff. Whatever you expected from the hotel, they fulfilled exceeded the expectation. Highly recommended for those who looking for short business trip, staycation during the current period, and personal leisure."
"Air condition temperature cannot go down from 22, and will go up to 24 early in the morning, you feel very warm after 5am. Complains made to the front office, the feed back is the lobby also facing the same problem, hotel management should look into it. Malaysia is a very warm country"
"it was good just tat rubbish wasn't clear inside toilet while i checked in. and the shampoo, body shower gel  wasnt refill .but after rectify with counter, it was quick respond and clean it immediately."
"I should re check in so that I can enjoy a clean room, if u were saying extend stay didn’t help to change bedsheet which is still acceptable. But did u expect the guest to bring the dish detergent to wash the cup ? Or u expect the guest just wash the cup by running water ??"
"Really disappointed and surprised by the staff, all are looking for ways to say 'No' to customers and upset them. They will not leave any chance to upset customers. Completely hopeless service and housekeeping is worst. Toilet are blocked everyday. Call 5 times to get house amenities. Please 'DO NOT' stay here at all."
"The place very strategic for family, business and gathering.. my kids and I love it. its just if swimming pool not open for public... hope u can consider to reopen swimming pool. the staff very friendly and good service to serve.. keep it up"
"Good hotel to stay as it is located in the center of bangsar. Furthermore, my visit was to attend to the Cengild hospital thats was just opposite to the VE hotel. This is the most essential reason for health tour in Malaysia."
"Stayed for 2 nights in the entry level room with a king size bed during the first weekend in January 2021.  Booking, check in/ out no issues.  Room is pretty decent, quite new. Didn't expect the hairdryer to be the type that has high voltage so this stood out for me. The blackout curtains were really good. The room is dim and could use some brighter lights installed. Shower and temperature control all good.   There's enough conveniences around here with 7e, grocery store, Family Mart, MyNews and several kinds of restos/ cafes all within walking distance, covered and via the link bridges.   This would probably be good as a business stay even so, I would want a restful stay but I could hear footsteps and the slight vibration when laying on the bed.  Furniture being dragged across"
"Overall nice staycation , worth of price, nice room , very clean , comfort, and the room it’s very cozy, the only bad things is the shower water will flow out from the shower room and make the area of the basin will be very wet. Overall is excellent"
"Overall stay was great. Parking was complementary for hotel guests which is a great point for myself as public transport may not be the best mode of transport here.  There is a strand of hair on the furniture and one more on the towel. Aside from that , cleanliness of the room is fair. Spacious enough for 2 person and bed was comfortable"
"From reservation to check out, we would say it was an excellent service by the team..Thank you for making us feel comfortable throughout the stay..The most cost saving, is the car park availability with ticket waiver.."
nice location and good offer to attract me stay. first time staying in VE hotel. will stay again if have good promo offer. the only sad part is the pool has been closed due to covid. will recommend to friends.
Always comfortable to Stay at VE.  Although at times the services is not 100%  The staffs makes good improvisation upon complaining.  Staffs well attend to the need of customers and are very respectful.  Hence overall stay is was good.
It was a last minute work trip booking and turned out a well made choice. Conveniently located within walking distance to shops and food outlets.  The one bedroom apartment was spacious and generally clean.
Good: - Good room interior - Spacious hall & ample room space - Nice city view (TM tower) - Ez acces to go shopping (Nexus mall)  Bad: - Slow kaw-kaw wifi speed - Some area inside room not well-cleaned  But overall is ok 8.5/10 star
"I had a wonderful stay made even better by all those excellent staffs by front office yoda, zarith, fariz dan amat from reception. The room was an amazing well decorated  with ballons for a friend's birthday.  Room equiped with all the equipment and utensil for light cooking. Plus huge thanks for excellect service provided by houskeeping for room cleanliness. The staffs' service are truly exceptional and they really took care of me and my friend very well. Terima kasih."
"I stayed several times here. Because it's location. Near by KLCC, Solaris. Most of all there are lots of food and mall near by. So, if you want to stay well located hotel at bangsar area.  I recommend you."
"Excellent service made our stay memorable. Entire staff - front desk, restaurant, housekeeping were extremely warm and supportive during during our stay, specially due to difficult covid lock down.  Hotel facilities and its location made our life easier."
Stay here for two days from 20th September to 22nd September because of a seminar held in the same building (Nexus conference hall).  A very pleasant stay with courteous and efficient staff. Both the staff that checked me in and out were very polite and helpful that it make all the difference for my stay.  The location is also very convenient with The Sphere just beside and Mid Valleh and The Garden Mall just a 5 minute drive away.  Will definitely come back for a stay next time.
"we checked in pretty late in the night. it was a very long day. I asked the front desk manager if he would consider giving us a free room upgrade and he obliged! I think his name was Syed.   it truly made my stay the best stay ever. he upgraded us into a corner suite. the room was amazing. the amenities, bedding, toiletries were up to my expectations. especially the pillow. I woke up feeling so relaxed. the gym and pool is very nice. well maintained.   the room came with free breakfast. it was a good one. everything tasted fresh and delicious. except the scrambled eggs... that was average.  the next day, I needed an important document photocopied. Syed again came to the rescue and helped me without question. He truly went beyond his line of duty and gave his best service  I"
"A very pleasant stay with very quiet and spacious rooms with basic amenities. It's right next to Connexion convention center so thr hotel is really convenient in terms of distance. Getting to the hotel is pretty easy too. The food (brrakfast at least) is delicious but due to COVID SOP, the queue was quite long as we waited to be served. The staff is very friendly and approachable. The key thing is that despite its elegant and grand outlook, it is extremely affordable. Definitely value-for-money!"
"The check-in process was quick and pleasant. Excellent staffs, very comfortable rooms, high class bathrooms using hansgrohe products. Comfortable beds. Really up to date with world class hospitality. The seminar halls are spacious with lots of ample audience space for social distancing during this covid pandemic."
"Poor staff knowledge. They can answer you : after 5pm, technician went back, you have to call back tomorrow morning.  Most of the hotel I book they are good and convenient and able to allow us for 1 or 2 hours late check out. I am very surprised that VE hotel say: can’t and not even want to listen to your reason.  Quite disappointing. Will definitely ask my friend or others not to choose VE hotel"
"Thank you Faris and his team for the best service in town! The checkin process was smooth and welcoming. The room was nice, I really appreciated the birthday setup and choc box! I love it! It was thoughtful and sweet of you. Definitely be back soon!"
"Took a deluxe king room that has a separate small dining/working space and all other facilities usually provided by a 4*  Precautions for pandemic were taken very well. Food was okay, you probably wouldn’t want more options at a breakfast buffet but a 4* probably should offer more, just my opinion.  Friendly staff.  Shops, bars, massage parlours, restaurants right opposite and beside. There’s one by the pool as well.  Great for tourists who don’t want the bustle of Bukit Bintang after a long day out.  Nearest hiking spot is Bukit Gasing.  Nearest mall KL Gateway, connects to Universiti LRT trains.   Buses leading to Central Market just 5-6 minutes walk to the left."
"cleaning team need to be improve as not well clean, all tables still dirty toilet still have residue. but the staff is friendly and helpful. good service provided from reception and restaurant. food is delicious"
"everything is perfect like staying at 6 star hotel but electric kettle  not good condition where some guest using eletric kettle for some cooking and the cleaner did not wash it well. when i want to use to  boul some water, the electrical kettle has some cook egg and maggie mee inside"
"Love the hotel. Reasonable price. Awesome location. Easy check in and check out. Clean and beautiful room. Good view too. I stayed in the studio room and deluxe room. Studio comes with kitchen, washing machine and oven. Amenities service is great."
"Good stay, The breakfast food availability, cooking taste is below expectation.The restaurant view is nice.  Overall location is good. Easy to access to nearby F&B outlets and convenient.  Suggest to enhance SOP of physical distance at the front desk, to provide sanitizer in front of lift at lobby and each level n"
"This my second time to came VE Hotel, the location is very good and all your staff very friendly to us and greeting us with smile. The cleanliness Is very good. And I hope the staff & hotel is good experience to me"
"The hotel provided a complementary birthday deco for my son, a very nice gesture. I love the breakfast spread, not too much choice but tasty. The room is big and clean. I got a corner room which is nice. My kids love the pool."
The room is clean.staff is very attentive. Breakfast is delicious and variety. Location is great.connected to malls and eateries.has lake garden for morning walk. Great staycation overall.my family enjoy it.
"Stayed in this hotel to attend a wedding function. It was a pleasant stay for us in overall, the only improvement that we think is needed is the egg station during breakfast. Ordered cheese omelette but there’s not a slightest hint of cheese; scrambled eggs tasted like scrambled egg whites."
very recommended..very satisfied..very cleanliness..very good service..must repeat..very suitable for couples..for family..the sauna n swimming are so comfortable..the for i think quite bad n not variety..
Checked in 8/8/2020 for one night. Hotel location strategic. Easy access. Room size moderate. Not too small not too big. Aircond well function. Water pressure in bathroom is good.  Breakfast variety too basic. Maybe due to COVID19 SOP.
"High recommended to everyone for stay here because VE hotel have an Excellent service, big rooms , clean & very comfortable.VE hotel also  value for money to stay for business, couple , family, friends or solo trip."
"Unplanned short getaway with mum. Had hi-tea buffet twice in 2017 and 2018 with colleagues and buffet lunch in 2017 with parents, so I purposely brought my mum for an overnight stay. She liked it very much. Value for money Well trained staff"
"While my past stay was good, this time, the lack of daily room maintenance was a let down. Is the daily  replenishing the room supplies, making up the bed and cleaning the toilet and room an issue? Until you change this policy, I don't think I will  stay there again. Otherwise, all else were good"
"locations is good. value stay . the place feels new and comfy recommended. especially business stay. staff are friendly and polite. definitely will be back for more stay when got chance. staff even remind me for the complimentary car park ticket when check out, which i had forgotten."
I Love room design !. Good breakfast only theres no buffet due to mco. Room very clean and comfy. Staff was very friendly and polite. A must-wear-mask policy is good. Not sure about other facility since i didn't use any. Owh and i got voucher for my next visit which is good right ? Tq ve ! 💋
"Enjoyed staying at this hotel. The staff were EXTREMELY helpful and kind. the Room is Clean and Comfortable.   only downside was bit noisy.  the best ever shortstay I experience before. Luxury facility and reasonable price, highly recommended.  Spacious room."
"One of the best hotel that I had stayed. The room is beautiful, comfortable and spacious. I really love the open area (same level as the restaurant I have my breakfast) especially during the night. The check in & check out process was quick. All the staffs were very helpful and friendly."
"Loved the spacious, modern, and clean room. I was on a working staycation so I absolutely appreciate the comfortable working space with plenty of USB and power sockets I can utilise. My room had a city view and if it doesn't rain, the inner city sunset scene is breathtaking. All the staff were friendly and helpful.   Apart from that, there is easy access to food deliveries and supermarkets, and there are cafes, bakeries and a 7Eleven on the Ground floor near the premises. There are also other cafes nearby. Free parking for hotel guests and Grab Cars are always a few minutes away."
"Overall it's not bad. Worth to stay, will recommend to friends and family, staff is friendly. The only main problem is transportation is inconvenient, there is nearby monorail or LRT have to request Grab to get to KL center."
"A very pleasant stay with excellent services by all the staff members. Room is large, very comfortable. Breakfast is really pleasant and satisfying. Easy access to public transports and malls and restaurants. Grab easily available. Will ckma back to stay again for sure."
We returned to VE with Tok and Nenek in tow. We thought it would be a good idea to let both Tok and Nenek rest on the weekend. Once again VE did not disappoint. Room was clean and fresh. Fenice at the reception remembered us when we stayed in June and welcomed us cheerfully.  We had a good breakfast in the morning. The young man who was we think the captain took notice of my elderly in laws and quickly seated us. He was very efficient too. Taking our orders promptly. Kudos to him.   We hope to make another stay in the future.
Room was excellent kept clean by Yan.   Staff at Cafe at M3 for breakfast were excellent. However food quality and freshness is terrible and cold .its happened more than twice during my stay after mco. Service at front desk was great by William like always
"strategic location, free basement parking for hotel guest, spacious and comfortable room. Friendly and helpful staff. Many facilities such as gym, sauna, swimming pool, but din get to try out due to covid-19, only gym open for now."
"This was my repeat visit. 1st I brought my mom along. She was happy with everything about the hotel from entrance, food, room, service. Me love the hospitality! So I came for 2nd time on the June 30th for a staycation. And will come again for sure to redeem the voucher given"
"Room is very comfortable and clean..highly recommended..Excellent experience.Great hospitality and Rooms were clean and comfortable..staff was very helpful..I recommend this hotel to anybody ,who is looking for a wonderful holiday and good sleep.."
"Just an average stay, as i checked in because it is just opposite my office so i can pop over to catch some sleep and then quickly return to office. Overall, the room is comfortable, quite clean but the air feels dusty. The bathroom amenities does not look like its been replenished. One thing i need most is a kettle to boil water, and that to my annoyance, is not working."
"I am quite satisfied with the hotel reservation, hotel check in process, hotel room cleanliness, comfy bed, bathroom shower pressure, free parking service and surrounding F&B service and reasonable price."
It is located in a wonderful low density location and accessible to any place of the city. The staffs are extremely courteous to the guests. The surroundings are very nice and good restaurants are available nearby.
"Cleanliness of the hotel room can be further improved, as a mild level of dust was found on the cabinet and table as well. Also, there were sticky residue found on the bedside table and perhaps your team may look into enhancing the level of cleanliness in the room. It was overall a satisfactory stay and I truly enjoyed the stay in VE Hotel & Residence, Bangsar South"
"This 2 years i been staying this hotel few times, i try different room Residence and hotel too. Their bed, bed sheet and pillow all using quality bed. The sound proof very good. I enjoy staying here when i working holiday in KL. Easy to access to Aeon , f&B and bar. Good location. I will be back again. I hope July there can give me special good deal or free for my birthday. I highly recommended this hotel or resident for big family too.  The breakfast is excellent  ."
"My first visit to VE hotel was back to 3 years ago. But they maintain the hotel very well, the building still looks new. The hotel room is cozy and clean. The price is very reasonable with the facilities and amenities being provided. I will be back again."
"Great services, friendly and polite staff members, clean and comfortable hotel room, delicious hotel breakfast, great location and environment! Definitely revisiting here again! This is a new gem found in Bangsar South!"
"At first glance, the room looks great! Upon closer inspection, you notice the flaws ...  My first room had someone's beard trimmings and hair all over the bathroom floor. When I changed rooms, the shower smelled like old urine.   Based on these experiences, I would not recommend this hotel!"
"i like the hotel because it was good and clean, i enjoy stay there because it comfort and safety for those who are travel and stay solo. food during breakfast was nice, view of the swimming pool was nice, easy to grab transport,"
"The room exclusive, great facilities, sauna and gym also great, the impotant is the front desk staff,polite and helpful. His name Hazieq, help me to give me a great room at level 19, nice view of bangsar and I will return here as return guest."
There is bed smell coming up every morning at my 1902 room hence I require to change/upgrade my room to residence type. The front desk and room service is excellence. Keep it up & there is always room for improvement.
"I have been in this hotel more than 10 times in the last 2 years. Hotel location is convenient to me as it is walking distance to my office.  The staff is unbelievably unprepared for the job. Even simple things in other hotel is normal, such as: don't bother you when ""do not disturb"" is on, keep asking to block in your credit card more money. They are constantly fumbling and surprising the guest with mess."
"This location is close by to office blocks and also restaurants. Convenient if you only go to work. However, the hotel room was full of smoking smell even it is a non smoking room. Water cannot flow out as soon. Towels were with holes."
"This was my first trip to Malaysia and I chose the VE Hotel & Residence based on its proximity to my office.  The hotel was clean and well appointed.  The rate was also ridiculously low (may average for Malaysia, but low for what you get).  The room was on par with premium international brands and the staff were very friendly.  Next to the hotel is an area with multiple restaurants so I didn't need to use a taxi other than for my trips from / to the airport.  Several office complexes are also within easy walking distance.    I'll definitely be staying here for my future trips to KL."
"Great choice for comfort and convenience. The bedding is comfy, water pressure great, breakfast spread pretty generous, coffee house offers great ambience (spacious, high ceiling, glass panels, bright, cheery). Opposite the hotel is Nexus where a good variety of restaurants and bars are available."
"Room very clean and spacious space with pleasant smell. the location for the power point beside our bed is good, because my husband need it for his sleep machine. Iron & board also provided in the room. Breakfast with variety of choice. check in & check out process very smooth without any problems.Excellent in front service."
Lobby CNY Decoration was beautiful. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Good foods for breakfast. Clean apartment with complete amenities. Front Desk Staffs are friendly and cheerful even though with mask on their face.. :)
"I had a pleasant stay. The room is clean, nice and spacious. The staff are friendly and helpful. The price is reasonable. I will definitely choose to stay at this hotel again in my next trip to Kuala Lumpur."
"Pleasant stay over the past 3 mths. Strategic location  with good, spacious and comfy room. Worth of money pay. Should have improve in food serving. Food seems not many choices but repeating every alternate day."
"VE hotel is one of my favorite hotel when I'm having outstation at KL. This hotel is really nice. Parking are provided at the basement and it is FOC. The staffs was very helpful and always greetings us with their smile. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. But VE hotel is one of hotel that provided with extra mineral water. Breakfast are provided at M3 level, there are lot of choices for food and beverage. You can choose anything to eat. Overall, I was very happy to stay at VE and will repeat it again, again and again :)"
"When i find a gem especially an accommodation i don't like to spread the news and keep it a secret. But they deserve to be mentioned, first location you are practically 10min (minus traffic) from everything and i mean everything KLCC, Mid Valley, DU, PJ etc the parking is free. When you arrive at the hotel its a little bit non descriptive almost an Aladdin cavern  but when you enter then it become a wondrous place. Aslo note you have a 7/11 and other stores conveniently located around the property only walking distance away. Now for the room, ever have a family and looking for big and always in the 1K range or have to get two room well look no further. We booked a 2 bedroom with 2.5 Bathroom with full kitchen and a washing machine/dryer for less than half what you normally get."
"Overall the entire building including rooms are well-maintained. Location is more of office business and part residential area with mixed of private condominium and public housing. There are a money changer and handful of deli shops and cafes close to hotel building (office operation hours) and there is a linked bridge to Nexus Convention Hall that have restaurants and some shops all around.   Take note that in order to get around to Mid Valley Mega Mall or downtown K.L city , need to take Grab and it cost around 15 Ringgit to Mid Valley and 23 ringgit to K.L Bukit Bintang area. Night time is pretty quiet no action since it is a business office zone.  Buffet breakfast though have many selection mainly  local delights with standard american breakfast but definitely not tasty. If"
"Location is good as its opposite a shopping area with lots of eateries and cafes. Parking is convienient. Room looks good, but thats about it. The toilet is dirty. Bath shower room is moldy. Sink is dirty. I hate dirty toilets."
"This is my fourth time staying in this place.  I like the size of the apartment and its location.  There is complimentary parking for hotel guests.  The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is well equipped. The staff at the reception counter are very professional and helpful, especially Mr Fariz and Mr William.   However, the housekkeping needs some improvement.  Sometimes they didn't replace the full set of toiletries and detergent.  There are also brown stains on the shower cubicle walls.  Other than these minor issues, I can't find any other fault in the hotel and I will defintely stay here again if the price is right."
"When I first checked in I tolerated with the old blood stains on the toilet bowl, thinking that I should lower my expectations since it's not a 5-star hotel. However I came back to my room to find fresh footprints on my comforter cover!!! This is totally NOT acceptable! My partner and I tried flipping the comforter over so that we can at least use the other side of it and guess what.....we found more blood stains in the inner part of the comforter! Totally NOT deserving of the 4-star review! I'd never stay with this hotel ever again! If you treasure hygiene - AVOID AT ALL COST!"
"Great room with complete amenities. Seperated shower & toilet. Lot of restaurant nearby, nexus, the sphere or kl gateway. or just take any food panda & grab food you won’t be disappointed. Got putra station nearby within 10 minutes drive. Overall stay was good"
A well supported APAC Conference by VE Hotel - excellent break out areas and separate meeting rooms. The 3 day event included a very good breakfast and drinks and dinner in the evening at the main facilities.
"On the 14th of Dec, 2019, I had a scary experience while staying at the VE Hotel. At 4 am in the morning I had a terrible shoulder and hand pain. My left hand was almost paralysed. I woke up in sweat. I called the hotel staff in desperation and they sprung into action. 3 people assisted me in a wheelchair, rushed me to the nearest medical centre, made me feel completely taken care of. Waited on me till I got the necessary medication and made sure I was feeling secure. The pain eventually receded because of the medicines and I was able to finish my work and come back to Singapore safely. I want to THANK the staff of VE Hotel for their AMAZING & SELFLESS presence and quick action in making sure I was given the right attention. THANK YOU VERY MUCH."
Highly recommended to all for stay up at VE Hotel. The room accommodation was very good. The room is very comfortable. Good view and the all staffs are so helpful and nicely. Fast response from maintenance once we got any problems at the room.
"The hotel even though is located in commercial district of KL, is more than just a business hotel. The rooms were very comfortable. We stayed 2 nights for a conference. The food was good. However for breakfast the hotel has only 1 live station counter which makes it difficult to get omelette."
My 1st time dinning at VE coffee house.. Super delicious food and very presentations... Very calm and nice environment..But they are not served ice water during my dinner.. So its a bit upset.. But overall is awesome.. Thanks to chef Farhan and team for the good hospitality.. Its very recommendation and I will come again..
"You will get the feeling of their full hospitality when you first enter your room - fruits, food, welcoming card and nice facilities. The lady at the dining hall will greet you with a smile always and you will feel the warmth of family from her."
"very beautiful space, good service, special thanks to Mr Shano the bellman for introducing about special foods in Malaysia, and the buffet restaurant as well,  everything is so comfortable. The way from hotel to the conference is good, and the staff are so kind and friendly, helpful"
"Convenient location for shops and restaurants, including those who need to access to the office buildings.  The hotel room is spacious, clean and friendly staffs.  Accessible to many other locations by Grab."
"Stayed 1 night at this hotel to have a feel of their service.I must say the room is superb,clean,modern and well maintain.The rate was at a steal and the room/hotel is way above than those charged higher.Location wise is ok.some eateries across the street (nexus).A mall is about 10mins walk.they do provide free shuttle (11am and 2pm) to mid valley mega mall.Only thing they need to improve is the lighting at the carpark.i find it is insufficient if u return late at night.a bright carpark is sign of the hotel welcoming u home i believe.Lobby is well decorated and modern.They shared the lift lobby with residence but different lifts.so no worries of overcrowding."
Clean room with great front desk services during check in and check out. I checked in approx 9pm and the service at front desk was fast with my room upgraded. Staff from the security to front desk was great. This is my favourite hotel in the kl city ... room was clean as usual... rooms were well equipped ...
"Between July to November, we have stayed at this hotel about 4 times. The last 2 stays at the hotel was not good.  The location of this hotel is good. Room size is a good size that you don’t feel confined. The layout is a good use of space.  In one of our stay, We had issues such as water ponding in the bathroom that resulted water flowing into other areas of the room- the hotel said that they were unable to change the room. They did send an apology note with apples and cookies. They didn’t solve the problem. That time we stayed there for 3 nights.  At check out there is always a long queue. If you are driving and need to get your ticket endorsed at the time of check in or check out, you might need to wait. As there are only 2/3 staff behind the counter.  Room service - they"
VE hotel is one of the best hotel in Bangsar South. The Breakfast buffet has a huge number of varieties. The overall ambience of the hotel and restaurent is Superb. The swimiing pool is also very good.
"Most, if not all, hotel guests appreciate privacy and security when staying in a hotel. That’s basically why there’s a Do-not-disturb sign outside the room. Hotels’ staff would normally respect the sign, and common courtesy expects the staff to not disturb the guests nor enter the room unless in the case of emergency or other exceptional reasons.   There were 2 incidents over my 2 nights stay in VE Hotel that were completely unacceptable. The first incident happened when I requested for an electrician to come fix my air conditioning. I waited but after 30 mins, I decided to put the do not disturb light on and went for a shower. While I was in the shower, the electrician arrived & he knocked loudly on my door. I rushed out of the shower to the door to tell him to come back later."
"So far I have no complaints staying at VE hotel. Very modern interior design and very comfortable stay. The service staff were friendly and helpful, overall experience at the hotel was excellent. However, the only downside is the food selection for breakfast, could have been better."
"Cleanliness was excellent. Staff was polite and nice. Just that I didn't get the room that I booked and delayed my check-in. However, offered me another room which was satisfying for me. The other thing is got to queue for sometime for check-in and check-out at lobby (there were a lot of guests). Overall is good."
"Yes, the hotel is first class but the price is just right, Apart from that, nice swimming pool, friendly staffs, yummy food, and restaurant is beautiful too, just a right place to stay in Malaysia.   I also liked the location of the hotel as there are several restaurants around it,"
"I stayed in VE hotel Bangsar South KL for 4 nights. I was a solo traveler and was there for a seminar. The hotel location is good and there are quite a few eateries and restaurants.  My hotel room was located on 19 floor with good city views.  The room was clean and cosy.  The bed was comfortable too.  Overall,  I have enjoyed my stay there."
"I stayed for one week, room price and room size was acceptable. - I ordered for high floor and king size room, but they said no more king size room and they gave me a middle floor room. - my room located at 7th floor, very loud noise from the street after 8h30 (cars noise, motorbike noise, construction noise, etc...) - check-in service was slow... not enough staff at the front desk (wait around 30min.) - hotel carpark service was stupid... u must go to the reception to read your carpark ticket, if have 10 people doing the check-in service, you have to follow the line to wait for the front desk staff to help you to read your carpark car. - the best things is the breakfast (toast set with the tarik, only10rm)."
The room was excellent for the rate I paid. I got a discount because of the offer given by Agoda. Otherwise the rate was quite high. The location was good as it was quite far away from the city centre. Anyway the Nexus and The Sphere was close by and linked by a skybridge! Thumbs up! The room I got was ok but the TV was not working. Anyway they rectified the problem as soon as I called. The LRT station was about 1.5km by foot and there were not many tourist spots around. A good place to stay if you want to get away from the usual touristy areas. The safe deposit box in the room was also not working. I expect better maintenance for a hotel with reasonably high room rates in KL.
"My office is next door so location was perfect. If in Bangsar South, this hotel is perfect. This is in a new development area with plenty of good restaurants, bars and cafes. The precinct feels a bit like Singapore with manicured gardens. The rooms are new which makes it comfortable. The gym is quite large with a good variety of equipment. There is a changeroom with shower facilities near the gym. The pool design is clever with being under cover but all open. I've stayed there twice now and would each time i go back to the office in KL. The train station is a 10-15 minte walk which takes you into KLCC KL City Centre (Twin towers). The bathroom has quite a few sliding doors (ie 1 that slies across a cupboard and the toilet, another that covers the wardrobe or closes the bathoom"
"Hotel is new, beautiful and very clean. Excellent location with a link bridge connecting to the opposite Nexus Bangsar South Connexion Convention Centre where we attended a seminar. There are restaurants nearby at the Nexus opposite, and a 7-eleven below the hotel. Short cab/grab away to nearby Mid Valley Megamall for lots of shopping and food choices. Some hotel front desk staff are friendly, customer service level is acceptable, but can be improved for front desk staff. Breakfast spread is quite good. Read a few reviews on hearing announcements from the mosque, but we didnt hear so when we stayed at Level 8."
"Very convenient for me since it is located right across Connexion Convention Center where I recently attended a seminar. There's a walkway connecting to the Convention Center. There are a lot of restaurants around the hotel. Also, it is just about 10 mins away from KL Central. My room on the 19th floor was really nice. I booked through an online app and everything I requested was given; a king size bed with daily breakfast. The staff were friendly.  The concierge even offered to call a taxi for me going to KL Sentral at 6:30AM."
