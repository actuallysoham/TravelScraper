"My fiancé and I had chosen to stay at your Hotel due to the location and distinctive architecture that features elements of the Malaysia’s unique heritage. Being a third party agency here in China, my fiancé can have a local Malaysian heritage and cultural experiences so that he can share his experience with the relevant parties here.   In the early morning of 26 January 2020 estimated 08:10hrs, I was about to leave the Hotel for reunion at parents, unfortunately, there was a high threshold between the bed chamber and bathroom, I crossed, slipped and fell down in the bathroom of room 455 due to slippery floor, caused my head to hit the ground injured the back of my head, with a lot of blood rushed out from the injured area. I remained calm and made a call to the operator to"
"My checked- in was done less than 5 minutes by Front Office named HAYATI.. she’s really professional & always keep on smiling to guests eventhough during peak hours!!! Thumbs up to this 1st impression gave by Ms. HAYATI.   Room was enormous & spotless clean. The downside are housekeeping didnt clear up the minibar, dialled no.1 from room phone to get housekeeping to clear it for me & a male operator working night shift on 4th Sept asked me to clear it by myself (whattt????????)  The water conditions during my stay was not really ok. It’s not hotel’s fault. Whole Kuala Lumpur facing water supply problem due to shutdown of main supply tank. A maintenance guy came to checked & told me duty manager (5th Sept 2020 1230am) will come within 10 minutes time to check on my room condition"
"With the current global situation now (covid19) this hotel offer great discount for the room that i can't afford during normal situation. Just take the chance to stay 1 night. Can be say, it is the good experience to me and my family."
"The staffs at the counter are so slow! All are taking a lot of time to do the check in. We don’t know how the situation will be like when it is during peak season (festive season or school holiday). When we arrived, there was average 4-6 people per line and waited 1.5 hours and still 2 people to go! If it wasn’t because the booking is non-refundable, we would have switched to other hotels nearby!"
"Pros: Spacious room with a bath tub, close to the KLCC and Bukit Bintang. Located at a quiet road, affordable spa massage, buffet breakfast even during CMCO - with good precaution in place.  Cons: Long waiting time during the check in and check out."
"My 1st stay was perfect everything is good. The room is exactly like hotel photos like they have shower screen and bathtub, staff qas nice and friendly and check in and check out was smooth. Mind you this room i book is the cheapest which is standard room. On my 2nd stay it was completely terrible and disaster ! Room is not like in the hotel photos, no shower screen but shower curtain which is broken, shower drain was clogged, carpet floor has stain, tea and coffee is not there and some furniture is dented. I ate their breakfast it was not worth it. Chef will handpicked for me but it was not filling. Not many choices mostly local cuisine. Facilities like gym and swimming pool was ok."
"Im here today, supposed to be checked in by 3pm,it's almost 2 hours later and still no signs that our room is ready.  My brother was assigned a room, which turned out to be a messy room, hasnt been cl3aned up yet! Yes, at this hour.  Long lines at the check in counter, whoever gave the 5 stars rating for this hotel needs to be fired.  The management tried to compensate us by offering this straight out of the packet ""welcome"" drinks.   Seriously stay away from this hotel"
"We stayed at Deluxe Connecting Room, 2 persons for each room. The ambiance was great and staffs were friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was delicious as well. In room dining price is quite cheap for 5 star hotel, with great taste and presentation definitely worth the price. Has spacious bathroom and comfortable room. Love the hotel design concept. They can get full stars if they maintain the room well :)  The hotel is really beautiful but need to improve on cleanliness and some of the furniture/fittings need to be fixed/replaced. The bathroom wasn't well cleaned, got few dark algae spots showing no scrubbing or deep cleaning is done for quite some time. Water was hot and clean on first day but turned brownish and wasn't hot on the next day, probably due to heavy raining the"
"The hotel has charm and the best breakfast is huge and with many different Western, Malaysian, Japanese, Indian, and Chinese offerings.  The rooms are spacious and have good comfortable beds.  It's situated only 5 minutes' walk turning left down Jalan Conlay to the Banyan Tree and the skywalk to the Pavilion Mall. At the Pavilion mall, you have a huge food court and some very good restaurants and bars. Just a few minute's walk from Pavillion you can catch the monorail trains to get around Kuala Lumpur.  Recoimendebel is also the Malaysian restaurant at the hotel. Very good food and service  We have stayed at this hotel several times and been well treated all the time."
I was shocked when i arrived here. Long damn queue to check in. Only 2 counters open. Hoping that i can check out late.  Concierge staff only see the queue. They did not take any initiatives to help the check in process. At least they should get extra counter open
"I was here for my graduation ceremony. It was an excellent experience, great food service and good hospitality. It was a night to remember and i was glad to get attend here as the luxurious atmosphere does give a positive and energetic energy to me and my family"
We stayed here at the end of a month long trip and are glad we did.  We stayed in a one bedroom apartment. The apartment was very spacious with a lovely big balcony overlooking the pool.  The space provided by the apartment was very much appreciated by us. The bathroom with double sinks and seperate bath made getting ready to go out easy. There is a dressing area just outside of the bathroom too.  The pictures are a true representation of the room. The kitchen is well appointed with everything ypu need to male your own meal. We ate out but enjoyed having the space sit and store any snacks/fruit we purchased. The aircon works well and it was a very quiet room.  The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The room was in good condition and furniture was not tired or worn looking.
"We had great time staying at Royale Chulan hotel during our trip to Kuala Lumpur. We really like the luxurious atmosphere, surroundings and the professional staff. Buffet Breakfast is super and there are variety of food for you to choose.Very good!"
"I love the breakfast buffet, so many varieties. The food are different every morning, so you won't get bored eating the  same food everyday.   The staff are welcoming, helpful and polite. The room was nice and tidy too."
"for the past 6 years we have come here to celebrate our wedding anniversary on previous occasions the hotel recognised this and we received a token cake which was always a nice gesture.. but not on this occasion. The Cons...there is a lot of high rise construction in very close proximity to the hotel and a lot of noise also the workers park all day blocking footpaths forcing you into the road. Very few TV channels only 2 in english Pool bar that is never open and no service around the Pool The Pro""s...its a really nice hotel with excellent staff..the rooms are spacious and clean. Housekeeping do a great job. Close to major attractions. Despite the shortfalls  the pool is nice. They have a new GM (Tony) who has taken the time to speak with us and is already making improvements"
we stayed here in October 2017 to go to the Moto GP. It was a lovely hotel breakfast was ver good with a lot of variety cloe to shops resturants and other attractions. Staff we very friendly and polite couldn't do enough for you. The room was very big also the bathroom. towels changed regularly.
"We have been guests at the Royale Chulan five times because we like the old style of the hotel.  In 2018 we had unbelievable negative experiences there.  We wrote a negative review in tripadvisor and didn't want to go back.   After the general manager answered us very nicely and in detail, we decided to check in there again in 2020.  When we returned, we first experienced the staff in a competent and friendly manner.  Unfortunately, we then had two experiences in the bar and in the lounge, which made us doubt our decision.  After another complaint, both events were excused and repaired.   From then on, fresh goods were served in the lounge for breakfast and good cappuccino was offered.  But not by the young male employees who just liked to stroll around in their nice dark suits."
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel and would love to be in a position to revisit at some stage in the future. The hotel was conveniently located not too far from the Petronas Towers and the KL Tower. We took a 7 minute walk to some gardens where, with thousands of other people, we saw in the New Year with a spectacular fireworks display at he PetronasTowers. Although the towers were a mile away from where we were stood, we had a fantastic view. The suite we stayed in was much better than we expected. We could not fault it. There was a great choice of dishes at breakfast, lunch and dinner. There was a section for local dishes as well as Western and other Asian foods. The food we ate was excellent. There is a large swimming pool and surrounding area and there is a"
Hotel royal chulan is an amazing hotel to stay inn. We were recieved by Ms sukdev on arrival. An amazing soul with an amasing personality Very cooperative and helpful. Location of the hotel is very good as 5 minutes walk from pavilion a Giant shopping mall with a wounderfu food court. Love to visit kuala lampur soon in the same hotel.
"I was at Royale Chulan for 3 month since Nov last year for a short stint on office assignment. I was kind of sceptical when I was first introduced by a friend. Not knowing that they also have a service suite. I have stayed almost all of the service suites in KL since 2009. I am convinced that I did made an excellent choice for choosing Royale Chulan. The service they have provided only suit or matched that were given to royalties. It was gratifying and satisfying!!! My family and I wanted to expressed our gratitude and a BIG THANK YOU to its sales Director, Pn Norlida and Pn Aisyah F&B manager for being so accomodative. Very supportive in ensuring all our business need and personal request were attended to in a very professional approached. The experience for staying at the"
"It has been a wonderful staty ere at Royal Chulan Kuala Lumpur! The hotel is really good! With a very good and helping proactive staff! Front desk staff are very helpful!  The check in was really swift! No hassle at all. !  Breakfast services offered at the buffet restaurant is pretty good! You get a variety to choose from local Malaysian foods, continental, Indian and etc,   The best part is it’s cleanliness!  My room was enormous ! With a bathroom itself as a suite! Along with a separate area for table, kettle, fridge and sofa.  The Ambassador Sue is such a great lady. She make sure the guests are being well taken care of during their period of stay! She’s a great leading workforce  and her staff maintains one of the best hospitalities one could get at a hotel!   Big thumbs up"
"Royal Chulan Kuala Lumpur is the ultimate property for both business and leisure travellers as it caters to families, groups and singles, it is absolutely fabulous. Centrally located close to the major shopping area and close to the twin towers, it was an ideal base for our stay. It is lucky to have an amazing team of staff specially Sukdev Kaur lobby Ambassador,bwho wants guests to feel welcome and enjoy their stay. We will be returning to this excellent hotel."
"Amazing value. All the staff provide first class hospitality. Our room was enormous and the bathroom was a suite in itself with separate loo and shower. Royale Chulan thinks of everything -bath robes, slippers, masses of storage space and great towels.  The swimming pool is big and towels are provided. Breakfast was a luxurious experience with a huge buffet choice.  Aiysha, the young lady managing, went out of her way to cater for my gluten intolerance."
"Our food adventures started again today after the long CNY weekend. This time to a beautifully appointed fine dining restaurant at The Royale Chulan. We were greeted by the very polite and well versed Raihan. He welcomed us, was courteous at all times and he served us with simplicity and sincerity. In short perfect service with full attention. We ordered the mozzarella caprese, scallop and salmon roulade appetizer and wild mushroom soup as a starter.The soup was good and hearty. The salmon with fried scallops were bite size and delicious. However the mozzarella was a bit bland with tomato and cheese. This could have been avoided with proper seasoning. Our mains consisted of sirloin steak with buttered ruffled truffle vegetables roasted mushroom. We ordered a rare and it arrived"
"Royale Chulan is a beautiful hotel. Staff were very helpful and pleasant. Breakfast was huge with a wide assortment of food.  Piano player in lounge one evening was a very nice way to relax after a hot day. Great location. Rooms were large as was bathroom. Very nice amenities. The only problem was the constant loud noise of the air conditioning which really never seemed to cool off the room. Bed was large and sorta comfortable. Mattress was ok but pillows were huge and heavy - I found very uncomfortable, top quilt was also heavy"
"- During checked in, I was told that the room is without breakfast even though our reservation with Agoda is with breakfast.  Luckily I printed out the Agoda reservation sheet and it stated there with breakfast.   - The room was very dusty (the  dust visible at all the furniture) maybe due to the construction going on around the area.  Travelling with young kids made us worried about their health.  The room window was opened when we first enter the room. - No room service menu in the room - As the kids already fall asleep, my husband had to go down to the coffee house and had his dinner there and ordered the room service for me directly from the coffee house.   - No coffee/tea amenities inside the room (the basket was empty) only had the kettle. - Only 1 set of tooth brush"
"Most disgusting hotel I’ve ever stayed at. Changed room because shower didn’t work. Pool is filled with unhygienic individuals that wear tracksuit bottoms and don’t shower before entering. Sitting by the pool right now and my partner and I can’t go back in as all the men are spitting and washing themselves in the pool. Most of the guests have complained and and left the pool side. Lights are broken throughout the hotel and the breakfast is a large array of left over dinner - we are provided with complimentary breakfast but haven’t bothered to attend since the first day. Room service was the worst pizza I’ve ever tasted and it’s not even worth complaining as we were so hungry - it was literally uncooked dough with a tomato on top. When we first arrived, we were exhausted from our"
"After reading the reviews for this hotel I almost cancelled my reservations. Yes, they need to up their game especially housekeeping. Yes, they need to put a bunch of money into remodeling. I am sure the hotel was quite luxurious at one time. But I enjoyed my stay here. I was upgraded to a junior suite. The room was huge. The pool was large and nice. There is no longer a view of the twin towers from the hotel. The gym was tiny but adequate. The club lounge is very nice and not many people choose to use it. It has several different styles of seating and was a nice place to have a glass of wine and watch a movie in the evening. I had read a review that said there was no alcohol served and was disappointed but there was wine and several kinds of cocktails. The hotel is very"
Dear Royale Chulan You are the best .  1: breakfast was perfect.  2: best location near sightseeing of kuala lumpur. 3: good fast service. 4: nice swimming pool. highly recommended. i will be back soon.
I highly recommend this hotel because it worths more than the price you will pay for that. The location was perfect near to klcc and pavilion mall. The breakfast has a good variety and the rooms are big with separate parts in bathrooms. Thanks all staff. You did great. Definitely come back to this hotel
Pls do something abt the names of royale chulan KL and royale chulan bukit bintang. So many guests wrongly booked the RC bukit bintang. I booked RC so many times but this time even i make mistake book wrong hotel. Cannot cancel as its non refundable and wasted 2 days booking charge. Then rebooked RC KL. Dont mind wasting money cos i travel KL to stay this hotel. Even the reception tell me the other hotel name is Royale bkt bintang  which guests book wrongly.. She doesnt know its now called RC bkt bintang so like me everyone is confused. Its not fair as many waste money and end up getting stranded like a guest i saw. Royale chulan do something abt this to save your image. These 2 hotels are worlds apart. RC bkt bintang is a poor hotel.  read reviews.  RC KL as usual is my
A disgusting welcome to Royale Chulan Hotel Kuala Lumpur. A/c not working. changed To different Room  but smaller& obviously downgraded. Arrogant front desk staff Aweya. Toilets not clean. Water mirky.   Arrogant front desk Supervisor named Aweya. Does not take ownership & does not value customer input. Too Defensive. Shud work in back office or in kitchen
Decor items in the room some are worn out and torn. Had some sleepless nights because next door guests smoke and noisy. Intense cigarette smell in my room even though it’s a non smoking floor. Hotel should be strict with this rule. Loud noise from a cultural event/wedding at Level 1 courtyard with constant pounding on a drum for hours till midnight. Room sound  proof issue?
Very well managed and huge property. They have all the facilities awaiting you. Rooms were nice and had all the required things there.   They have a open swimming pool but I did not like it. It was small and not that attractive.   Breakfast was not mouth watering. I did not like it much. They could have given better options.   Pool could have been better.
"R C Hotel is located in down town, few minutes away from Pavilion Shopping Center & night life street of KL! Rooms & beds are big enough to get easily rest! good foods. very nice facade & design with the war colors which make you feel that you are part of the KL city! the only thing that must be taken care by hotel management is the cleanness of the baths, specially plastic seals under the glass doors which separate toilet from shower! Thanks for warm greeting in the reception."
"The hotel has very friendly, professional and courteous staff who of course all speak perfect English.  The room, as can be seen in the photos, was large and with a very big comfortable bed. The bathroom is also very large with a separate shower, toilet and a big bath. But be warned(!) as the toilet needed to be fixed twice so be careful with toilet paper and flush often as it’s very prone to getting blocked easily. It must be said however the maintenance guy came within 10 minutes and fixed it within 2 minutes on both occasions.  The hotel is in a very central location but the walk to the hotel needs to be done over a walkway from the Pavillion shopping mall to  another building but this only takes five minutes. However it can be confusing at first! Especially as the shopping"
"stay here on 30/11/2019 for one night with family for our shopping trip. I've booked 3 rooms.  hotel room spacious, breakfast splendid, but I dont like hotel staff attitude.   first, today after breakfast before continue my shopping, I've requested for late check out up to 1pm for all 3 rooms, the receptionist said no problem to extend my stay. out of sudden there is one staff name Aviana came...she said I cannot extend my stay till 1pm for all 3 rooms, only 1 room is allowed for late check out...which I told her that I'm not intended to check out at 1pm, just in case I cannot make it to get ready every thing. she still refuse and kept repeating her words with funny english language. I feel annoyed with her..so I walk off.  second...this morning I went to car park lift...I went"
"Hotel is very old and it shows. The air conditioning at lowest setting causes a very audible hum throughout the entire room and there are plenty of construction activities nearby making the area a hazard when walking out of the hotel. Not to mention forget about having a good night sleep due to the AC noise.  The worst part is, while charging my laptop, the power point exploded and wiped out my charger and laptop. Manager was nice and apologetic but seemed to imply that the issue might be with incorrect voltage on my laptop adapter, which is completely ridiculous horse manure because laptop chargers are universal and I never had a problem travelling in US, Japan, Europe etc.   Hotel is basically a HSE and fire hazard, the Fire Department should do an audit on the whole building"
"As always, my stay at the Royale Chulan was perfect. Great location & value for money. Good dining options. Swimming pool area is fantastic, and so is the spa. Live pianist in the lounge bar each night was a bonus. Big rooms with luxurious bathrooms. Room service staff, Allesandro & Abdhulla are lovely. Liomsi & Jenny in the Lounge give great friendly service always. Azizi at reception looks after you as if you are family. In fact the reason I always stay at The Royale Chulan in KL, is the staff. They go above & beyond to make sure you enjoy your stay. Sri, Wizam, Shan, Adnan, Azmi, Kai...all of the staff, are the best in the business. Would highly recommend this hotel...I will stay again, for sure. Thanks again guys & girls at the RC. See you all again soon! Kym"
Have stayed over numerous times and have had great service and excellent attention from staff all round.The Front Office Staff from the Manager to Housekeeping do a great job. Highly recommend the property.
We love the environment here. The hotel room is superb. The housekeeping service is excellent 👍👍👍. Keep up the good work guys 👍 The check in and check out process is good. We love the food here👍❤️. Reasonable price. Worth it👍
Have stayed here on previous times for the Moto GP. Easy walking distance to the Centre or KLC Park and Petronas Towers and the Beach Club ?? Easy to order a taxi and always reasonably priced fares to anywhere in and about KL.
"First of all I was given a smoking room and the smell of cold tobacco was atrocious. I asked to have a non smoking room and got one with no problem.(they could have asked me first that would have saved some time). The bed and the pillows are comfortable and the bathroom is spacious ( the bathtub is narrow though). The amenities are very basics. The downside is the lack of foreign channels and the non existent children ones.  You can also hear the thunder or someone driving fast and screeching their brakes. It is very well insulated. The AC is fine. The breakfast has a good range and the quality is adequate, nothing special or delicious, just fine. As for the staff they are reasonably friendly but not extra friendly. On the whole it’s good value for what you pay and get."
"Stayed 4 nights here for our annual meeting,; chose the Executive suite, a very large and comfortable room.My family stayed with me and I had an extra bed in the living room for an extra person. We had ample space to relax in. The bed was nice and firm and the bathroom was really spacious.  The buffet breakfast spread was very good, ala carte dinner at Warisan café was delicious.  Staff were excellent, polite , courteous and went out of their way to assist us. There was always follow up to our requests, This hotel is in a very quiet and peaceful location, away from the more busy and hectic areas of KL."
"We stayed at this hotel for our week stay in Kuala Lumpur. We found it beautiful and the staff amazing, they were always wiling to help. Check in and out was quick and easy. Hotel is very close to the Pavilion and Lot 10 about a 5min walk away. 20min walk to Jalan Alor where you can get amazing street food. We found eating in Times Square or Lot 10 food courts just as good and cheaper. The pool was fantastic and often no one was there. The night club had a great band worth checking out for sure. Can't wait to come back."
Huge hotel with spacious rooms though outdated. Check in was very fast and the staff were friendly. Has all facilities in it and the location is close to Pavilion Mall. Breakfast had wide varieties but nothing was tasty. The staffs in the egg station and roti canai  were not helpful . On the last day of our stay we met Chef Thana who was very helpful and prepared some food for us . Concierge services were good
"We have a certain status with a hotel booking major company that gets us free upgrades etc and they pretended to not understand what we wanted so didn’t have to upgrade up (they are supposed to offer as part of this) had to take out the app and took three staff to rap their Brain around it. Our ‘upgraded’ room had loose hanging light fixtures, stained carpets, towel rack hanging off, leaking sprayer on both tub and shower and was very dated looking wear and tear wise.  Only pros is hot water was good and bed comfy.  AC did not work well. That was all liveable for price but the part we hated was the staff was a mess.  They were friendlish but all super confused at all roles. It was like all the staff at front desk it was their first day.  We asked for a late check out and were"
"i been there for my cocktail dinner, brilliant menu by the chef, good selections with great varieties. local noodle soup, rojak mamak, selection of pastries with nice chinese dishes also good. The ambient for the dinner was great too, spaces and happening. congratulation to chef sabri and team.. walla."
"Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur Stopped here on our last night after an island-hopping fortnight down the East coast of West Malaysia. What gem this hotel is, right from when we entered the staff were excellent, the lady receptionist really made us feel she was happy to see us and sent us off to an upgraded room which I can only explain as palatial. This hotel must have the best breakfast in Malaysia there was a vast, varied and well-presented array of dishes on offer. We now know that every time we are in Kuala Lumpur we will stop here, a hotel that seems to pride itself on service and quality."
"Royale Chulan is an old but classic hotel. Lobby is massive and quiet & I like the design. Our room has a king size bed, spacious, has TV and ref. Bathroom is also nice with toiletries. Will definitely go back👍"
"I love the room especially bathtub! Very spacious, clean and great seperation from bathtub,  shower and toilet. Need to improve your staff at the reception area; they don't smile at all and not welcoming. Breakfast is nice with variety of food.The rest is okay."
"We went for the BBQ Saturday dinner on 24/08/2019. The place is nice and simple, but for being a BBQ dinner the choices were limited. If you are expecting lots of choices as a BBQ Buffet Dinner, then its not the right place.  Its in BB so close to all the shops and Pavilion."
Very bad service. On the first day we went out around 11 am and turn on the make up room button but when we came back around 4.30 pm they still not clean the room. We waited in our room till 6pm but no one came to make up the room. We went out again around 6pm with the make up room button still on and this time make an extra effort to put the make up room card on the door knob and specifically told the front office staff to make up the room immediately but when we came back around 8.30pm the room still not make up. I call the front office again and went down again and report this case and they just take it like it was not their problem and one of them even accuse me of turning the do not disturb button.  The way the front office staff reacted is like it’s just a small and common
"One of the best hotels in Kuala Lumpur.  Quite flashy entrance and its an old hotel so, rooms are not that new, but definitely the overall experience doesn't disappoint.  The location is quite close to most of the attractions and rooms are large with all the required amenities.  In the hotel-restaurant offers quite a good collection of cuisine and also great breakfast as well."
"Stayed 2 days in August on business trip . Couldn’t fault the price at £50 a night for a 5* hotel.   Entrance to hotel , which is down a back road subject to construction is a bit daunting and feels unsafe at night currently but it’s fine .  Hotel lobby is stunning , and there are multiple places to eat and drink at reasonable prices . The club area is dark and the air con is likely to drop water on you if you sit at the bar.   The rooms are , on the face of it , reasonable but I wouldn’t call it 5* quality. They are a bit dated . Wooden poles, somehow meant to be part of the bed wee lying loose on the floor under the bed. The plumbing in the bathroom was subject to easy blockage.  The aircon in the room- noisy noisy and noisy but due to the heat you have no choice but to leave"
Usually I leave a review after my stay but i was so disappointed at check in that I have wrote this once the in room WiFi was connected.  I was not given an upgrade because the hotel was full which I can understand. However they just offered me vouchers for 20% off their f&b which I confirmed with them that all hotel guests get. So Where's the privilege for Expedia gold??? Best part they gave me one of the rooms facing some dingy back of a building.  I usually have pretty nice experiences at other hotels that are considered Expedia Gold partners in Taiwan and Japan but this partnership with royale chulan doesn't seem to take this collaboration seriously.   In future I would suggest all Expedia gold members ask their privileges first before booking so you can weigh between
"I lost UD$500 notes in Royale Chulan Hotel Kuala Lumper when I stayed there between 1 and 4 Aug.  I can confirm that I have the USD notes ($100 notes x 7 = $700) in my travel bag when I checked in and put them into the room safe box. I set up the password correctly and locked the safe box properly.   However, when I came back australia on 5 Aug, I found that five $100 notes (in the middle) were replaced by five $1 notes. My travel bag was with me whole way back home and never left my eyes. The only time that the notes could be replaced was in the hotel room. Most likely between 2 & 3 Aug. The one who replaced the notes should have the five $1 cash with him/her. This means she/he should have known I have $100 notes. He/she didn’t replace all the seven notes, but only the middle"
"I'm currently staying in this Hotel. I have checked in on July 31st and will check out tomorrow. I would say everything is over than 5Stars Hotels, Staffs, Services, cleaness, view of superior rooms, access to Buckit Bingtang(8 Min. By walk), swiming pool and lubby. My family enjoying their time during these days,  I may thanks ROYALE CHULAN 5STAR HOTEL'S team for their efforts."
Great unique architecture. Friendly and helpful associates. 👍🌹 Very spacious guestrooms with great bathroom lay out. Central location..in Town.  Love the Breakfast spray👏...🥐🍽️🍒 We are happy with our stay and will certainly return soon again. 🌹🚘😄🇲🇾
"From the beginning, the surprise was that they didn't prepare anything about our arrival (knowing that I contacted with them via e-mails and asked them and confirmed that I want something special and when we arrived they asked us to wait an hour to start). The second surprise was that the room was very dirty, the floor had footprints, lenses for eyes on the table and remains of food and dirt on the chair. After that, we asked to change the room, but the hotel wasn't equipped with good facilities, and the main problem was that 90% of the staffs couldn't speak English and this was one of the biggest problems that we faced."
"I’m about to check out after a great stay of 2 nights. Lovely spotlessly clean room. Breakfast wonderful. I have excellent Nasi Lamek but the guy making the roti insisted that I try some of the batch that he’d just made, and I was very pleased that I did. Those wanting a ‘western breakfast’ might be surprised that there are Brussels sprouts in the ‘western selection’, but they were delicious. Lovely helpful staff. I note that in life, how one treats others is generally reciprocated, and hotel staff are no different. Fast reliable WiFi. Couldn’t ask for a better location nearly equidistant from Bukit Bintang and Petronas Towers. Oh: the complaint about an empty minibar: what does one expect in a predominantly Muslim country?"
"Reviewed Jul 18, 2019 Never come back I stayed there 18-21 July to attend the MTS congress that was held at the hotel ballroom at ground floor . My room is 311, at third floor with the balcony above the ball room. On 21-july 7am (yes, early 7am, not pm!) I was woken up by very loud music from outside the balcony, sound like there is a party with music and dance. When I went out to the balcony the noise was even more terrible. I phoned front desk, the lady said will check, noise non stop... phoned again 7:45am, another staff said will check, I asked him to hold on, I opened the balcony door and asked if he can hear the music.......finally the noise stopped around 8am. I wonder why there was the loud music, according to the schedule of the MTS Congress, there was no function"
"We were staying for 3 nights on 7 jul to 10 jul.Room was clean,big bahtroom.When next door looking tv you can hear everything and cant sleep.Mini bar was empty, even for drinking water I have to call them all the time. They just bring you 2 small bottle for that much room money. Ketle was broken , bahtroom as well I called them 3 times to fix it. When they come for fix ,said ah u can use another shower. Why I cant use bath that much money I paid? Breakfast good if you are like to eat Asian food many options. Wester breakfasy option not much bread,egg,salads,bean... Good location. If you download Grab aplication you can go with taxi every where very fair price. For that money you can stay another hotels. Its not good value for that money. Not recomended."
"Stayed 4 nights in this fabulous, very spacious and one of its kind hotel in KL just recently. My family and I really enjoyed our stay here. The location is prime - close to many attractions by walk. All hotel staff was super nice and helpful. From doorman to front desk staff and managers - all very courteous and accommodating.   Our rooms, very spacious and comfortable. Beds, bathrooms, hallways and lobby all very clean and immaculate.   Breakfast was great every morning. From Malay to Chinese to Continental to American to whatever you can think of you will find it in buffet.   There was a construction going in one of the hotel wings and due to that our a/c stopped working one night so we informed the hotel management. They immediately transferred us to a larger, beautiful"
"the hotel is nice, majestic and ancient in the same time. there are signs of aging however its well maintained the balcony i got in the royal club was really spacious breakfast spread was wide, very close to Pavilion and also KLCC all the amenities was provided in the room. the TV is quite small for a big room"
"Lovely hotel, great rooms, sumptuous and diverse breakfast, even though im not a fan of hotel buffets but the fresh Roti that you can see being made along with some beef or chicken rendang made a great change. You can still get all the usual stuff so don't worry  Rooms are very spacious with a nice big bathroom with separate walk in shower and bath. The staff are amazing, efficient, polite and helpful, never had any problems at all. I can't believe some people said they were unfriendly! Maybe it was your attitude to them that was the problem. A nice smile and a hello goes alot further than snapping your fingers and bellowing at them. They are employees not your slaves!  Pool and gym area are great and spotlessly clean 5* luxury at a good price, well done royale Chulan KL"
The hotel doesn't meet 5 star rating standards. Staff is impolite and cold. Refrigerator in our hotel room didn't work. It took the staff 2 days to resolve the issue. Our stay was for 3 days. They put a bigger fridge in our room after several complaints but it smelled awful and wasn't that effective. Rooms were not adequately lit. Food was okay not great and had limited vegetarian options (which we were aware already). Overall a bad experience as the hotel staff is also not hospitable and courteous.
"Returned to royale chulan after 6 years and nothing much has changed, which can be good or bad. Good cuz its the same old nice warm cozy service & malay hospitality, bad maybe it needs a bit refurbishment in sme areas. But overall happy and will again return when we visit KL!"
"I stayed here for 3 nights, and since it was my first in KL, I didn't spend an awful lot of time in the hotel as there was so much else to see.  What I did experience was:  1. Check-in and check-out: the check-in process seemed to take a while, despite being the only person checking in.  I was every so slightly massively jetlagged though, so maybe it just felt longer.  Check-out was at 6 in the morning and was quick and easy.  2. Room was pretty big and had a small patio with a view over the pool.  Bathroom was also well-sized, so no complaints there.  I was able to use a spare keycard to keep the aircon going while I was out, which I was very happy with as it was quite noisy when it was on full tilt.  3. Bed was very comfortable, with a nice selection of pillows.    I didn't"
It is tucked in Jalan Conlay and away from the Bukit Bintang stretch of traffic and crowd. The staff is polite and attentive. In room dining was not the best in terms of taste but reasonably priced enough to forgive its mediocrity.  Rooms were clean and spacious. There were a few negative points as well for example the carpets in the foyer and common areas smell musty and old. It gives the majestic looking hotel a rather old feel unfortunately. The televisions are also too small for the rooms that size as well.  Overall an average hotel which could do with some sprucing up. Appears tired and old which is a pity when it can be so much more.
"I lost my bag in the hotel during my stay April 24- May 1 and it has never found. They checked the CCTV but useless.  If you checked other guest reviews, you can find the same issue at this hotel; a guy who lost his cell phone! Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before booking here."
"Visited with family from India. We were very satisfied with the overall experience of our stay right from checkin time until checkout. Courteous staff, prompt and quick service, spacious rooms, tasty buffet breakfast and great hotel ambience  Suitable for all kinds of travellers/ be it business or family  Location is very central and just about 10 mins walk to Pavilion Mall and Bukit Bintang"
"Clean and quite place, located in a good site of the city, near to the pavilion and other places around the city. Comes with 5 star spa, pool, gym and free of charge parking. would pay a visit in the future perhaps"
I have stayed at this hotel many times and this is another update review on the hotel. It is in the perfect location in KL and the hotel standards have not dropped. Sadly the business manager Suria has now moved on but the rest of the staff as ever go out of their way to look after me. The duty manager Mr Nor Ridzuan Hassan was on hand to make sure that all repeat customers get looked after and he was doing an amazing job and he is a credit to the hotel and the rest of the management team. The food is as good as ever and I love Malaysian food and the spices that they offer. The buffet offers a good choice and variety. I was lucky this trip as they had a 30% discount promotion on and it was well received. The rooms are cleaned daily and the cleaners will always ask if you need
"Good location as walking distance to Pavillion Mall, but the hotel is quite old. Room was good with pool access, air conditioned is super cool. Breakfast spread is just average. No problem with in room dining even at 3 a.m. Staff friendliness is commendable."
"A really 5stars hotel- just a 5mkn walk to the main shopping street of Bukit Bintang. Initially was booking for hotel of same name but different location(Bukit Bintang). Initial distress turns into a blessing. Location quieter part of city. Hotel marvellous place with great variety of breakfast and huge pool. Room was large ,more than 40sqm with a modern facilities. Found it to be better- location and cost compared to Westin or Grand Millenium."
Pros: Huge room Beautiful design  Nicely decorated  King size bed  Huge toilet/shower/Bathtub Buffet spread is good Walking distance to Pavilion  Love the pool and the gym Easy access to everywhere  Easy to get a Grab and taxi Friendly and helpful staff   Cons: Nothing   Ps:  Strong recommendation! I'll be back again for sure!
"I had done several emails for early check in since I was travelling with kid but during the check in I was told there is no room available. I requested them for any room, then reception agreed to give me executive room with one day extra charge. Next day they told be no rooms are available so I can stay in that room after multiple follow ups. I was told they have Indian chef but later I came to know Indian chef had already left the hotel. So no Indian food in the hotel. Breakfast had very limited Indian food choices.Since no Indian food I had to order food from outside. The 2nd day in room dining/room service refused to provide me with plates, after much discussions they told I should keep the plates until check out i.e I should wash myself and use it. Ultimately I used paper"
"We stayed there for a getaway from kids/staycation last weekend but it was a terrible choice.   1. The bed and pillow was very uncomfortable and hard. We woke up a few times during the night to adjust our position and stretch a bit from sore-ing.  2. We were told breakfast was served until 11am but when we came down at 9.50am, most of the food was gone and they did not replenish. Even the drinks counter were empty - only the coffee machine works.   3. The lobby has a strong smell of lemon-grass. It is nice but just too much.   4. The shuttle to pavilion is only 2 times a day."
"Homely property have stayed over 6 times. Needs up dating specially the rooms and some public areas. Excellent staff, and Management. Great food and the breakfast is Gastronomical.  Absolutely convenient location for shopping, and restaurants. Travelling in September again and staying at Royal Chulan."
"A lovely hotel in central KL. It's located a few minutes walk from Pavillion. We loved the pool area that was quiet and perfect for relax, sunny area all day long if that is what you are looking for. The room was nice and clean, and the staff was very service minded.  I highly recommend this hotel."
"We were mesmerized by the hotel unique design, which is based on traditional Malay design & wood carvings, with grand entrance. The room deco is also matched with the external designs.   The hotel is centrally located with multiple shopping centres situated around it and for those interested to discover local crafts item, craft complex is just next door.   We stayed in Royale Club room, which has a balcony facing the swimming pool & a large bathroom. The selection of TV channel is however limited, especially for children.   Breakfast selection is average. The rest of facilities & services are as expected according to the star rating."
"This was our third visit to the Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur and it was our last. Our previous visits were always pleasant and we had no issues. We stayed for 2 nights in a room that could use a make over. There are general signs of wear and tear that need attention given that this is a 5 Star hotel. Paint on doors is chipping and discoloration of the tile joints in the shower.  Also I would not expect to have holes in the sheet on the bed.  The check inn was smooth and quick and we were given discount vouchers for the hotel restaurants. As it had been my birthday we decided to visit the steak restaurant. What a surprise to see that we were the only 2 guests in the restaurant, including the other 2 adjacent restaurants. My partner and I both ordered a Sirloin Steak and a glass of"
"Ridiculous and awful hotel.cockroachs were all around even in therefrigerator. Telephone did not work , so I went to the reception and asked for another room. Second room was better but the smell of cigarette bothered us because we have 6 months baby. Finaly I guess these problem is in the malaysian culture."
"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights to attend a conference held in the hotel.  I arrived at the hotel at 1pm thinking that the rooms may not be ready, but there are already ready rooms. The Check in experience was good. It was done in 5 mins. Room size is considered big with a huge bath tub that can open up to the room itself. The TV provided is 32”. In my opinion, it is abit small for the room size. The carpet in the room feels like it has not beem chemically washed or shampooed for awhile. I usually walk about in a hotel room barefooted, but for this room, i had to use the bedroom slippers provided. Besides that, the room generally is not too bad. Breakfast is at the cafe next to the lobby. The spread is acceptable, but does not have a “wow” factor.  The hotel is a street next"
"In the middle of our stay, we contacted the hotel directly and they gave us an unbeatable price, emails with customer service was quick and polite. We were upgraded on arrival which was very much appreciated. 1 bed apartment with huge balcony and bathroom. All the staff very welcoming and those that recognised us from our previous visits were genuinely pleased to see  us , especially the bengali chap in the tuxedo in the restaurant and his two assistants,  I am sure that if they could have brought breakfast to our room the y would have done. We also had dinner in the restaurant it was very  nice. Salahuddin who was our housekeeper on our previous visits came to see us every day  to make sure all was well and Sophia our cleaner came and introduced herself on the first day which"
This is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in its only saving grace is the location we were a group of 7 The toilets in all our rooms were blocked we moved rooms 3 times The damp smell was unbearable The juice dispensers at breakfast had never been washed for the 3 days we stayed Too many cleanliness issues to write about will never recommend such a hotel 😠
"Extraordinary well-groomed appereance of the entire staff. Super service ,nice bar music classic evergreens. We tried all three restaurants, all highly recommendable. Room equipment could be improved, night lamps , more plugs. but at least a big fridge. Beds a bit to hard for us head cushion rolls not so convenient. Major target group Asians and so is the breakfast, not bad anyway. Huge complex with severals event facilities.  Allover expererience very good,"
"Just the scent of the hotel when you walk in, you know it's Royale Chulan KL.  Although all the construction are pretty annoying with Malaysia's pedestrian walkways seem to be non existent. And all the more if you are equipped with the stroller, you're in one hell of a walk when you're walking to the nearby Pavilion.   One way to get to Pavilion if you are equipped with a stroller is to walk on the right side of the road until you get to the Banyan Tree Hotel where they have a lift that get you across to the bridge to Pavilion.  Heard the breakfast is very popular among the hotel stayers. Maybe we'll try that next time!"
We really liked this hotel.  It was close to the city centre and amenities. The buffet breakfast was excellent and the swimming pool was lovely and pretty much deserted.  We were in one of the upper storeys and so the traffic noise was kept to a minimum. The hotel reception rooms were huge and the bedrooms were spacious and clean.  The staff were helpful and courteous.
Stay in this hotel on Dec 2018 in Royal Club room. Waited for about 10  mins to be check in which is slow for a guest staying in club room. Wanted to check in at the normal check area but been told to wait for someone to check me in. Room was clean. Housekeeping was prompt when requested for extra items. Breakfast was good with nice offering but should have more  varieties at the salad bar. Walking distance to Pavilion Shopping about 5 to 10 mins walk. Too bad this hotel does not have sauna facilities but when booked under Hotel.Com it mentioned this hotel has sauna facilities. The information provided by Hotel. Com is misleading so take not no sauna in this hotel.
"We were impressed from the first moment we arrived, until the end of our 6 nights holiday  in Kuala Lumpur.   We spend Chrismas days in Kuala Lumpur, so the hotel was decorated with huge trees, with lights and other winter decorations. Its entrance hall is huge, with Royal air and tastefully decorated.  They organised a small show with music and dance for Christmas - which all guests enjoyed a lot.   Check-in was quick, the staff extremely helpful.  We had a wonderful breakfast every morning, at Warisan Coffee (amazing selection of breads and flat breads from all over the world, some freshly made by handy bakers, in front of our eyes) The joyful boys at the Concierge helped us booking a massage at the hotel Spa and finding our ways in the city.  Room was big, clean and nicely"
All the staff were so nice and gentle especially Mr. Wesam from the reseption with all respect to the others as well for their assistance nothing more you can request feom this beautiful hotel and they have a very nice spa and swimming pool
"I give this hotel twinkle twinkle entire universe stars,every corner of the hotel staffs were very helpful smile on the face , breakfast was super nothing missing uncountable varieties on my return from Singapore to this hotel Reception night staff Mr Azizi gave me and my wife free room with breakfast at our early morning arrivals even we were booked after 12 midday check in but we arrived very early morning 5 AM and he gave us free room to sleep also on our departure checkout time 2 staff cane to say us good bye and 2 Porter staff to help us to place our luggage in the taxi very luxury hotel with polite staff."
We've stayed a night at Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur. The hotel is a bit rundown especially the carpet going to the room. There's a kind of smell along the way to the room. Staffs are friendly. However the breakfast was not as expected for the price of RM77. More to Malay kind of food. No beef bacon and smoked salmon for breakfast.
"Let's start with a few positives.  1.  The location (close to the pavilion shopping centre and heaps of restaurants).  2. The food (breakfast & dinner great buffet, amazing selection & room service delicious too).  It pretty much stops there.  As far as the room was concerned it was old and tired and not cleaned well.  There was mould in the shower, I had to get maintenance to unblock the toilet multiple times and they didn't seem to clean when they 'serviced' the room.  And I use the word 'serviced' very lightly.  First day I had towels, hand towels and floor mat.  then the hand towels disappeared and then the floor mat.  They weren't replacing them.  Even when I specifically asked the lady who was in my room at 6:30 at night, she said yes, looked in her cart and realized"
I had a short stay there but my experience was great. the place offers a variety of food and was spoiled of choice. They also have great services and they are located not far away from the twin towers.
Royale Chulan is an olde world style hotel with charm and sophistication.  Food was delicious and the service was great. The piano bar and service was excellent. Location great for sight seeing and shopping. The only negative are people smoking - still indoors. Overall a beautiful hotel to stay in for a few days.
"“Royale Chulan Kuala Lumpur, a luxurious 5-star accommodation”. Well, I beg to differ.  From, worn out carpet, torn bed sheet and what can I say about the window. I guess it must have not been cleaned since they officially opened in 2013. I get the traditional concept of the room, however, all the furniture and the curtains are too outdated for a 5-star hotel.  Another point that I would like to highlight is that the hotel has regulations on wearing a singlet to the Warisan Café. Well, I experienced it first hand. I obliged and change my attire since it is the hotel rules. However, while I am having my breakfast, I can see two men wearing a black singlet in the café. Wait. Why can they wear a singlet and have breakfast while I have to change my shirt to follow the hotel rule?"
"Stayed here for 3 nights. Check-in was smooth and they upgraded our room. Good views are only available for non-smokers only as per hotel policy.   As a vegetarian you can not find anything good to eat in hotel. But buffet breakfast was seems to be tasty.  Rooms are superb, Pool was nice and clean. Hotel is close to bukit bintang and other tourist places."
