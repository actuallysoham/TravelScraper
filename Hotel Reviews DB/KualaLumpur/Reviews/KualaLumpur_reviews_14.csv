"All was good, from front desk, parking and room. pool view was superb kl tower view. room was clean, walking distance to pavilion and restaurant like mcdonalds. Thank you for upgrading room from studio to 2bedroom suite, we love it so much. Thank you Parkroyal Service Suite KL, will come back next time."
We were here for a three nights‚Äô stay and we felt like we were at home! Loved the layout. Fully equipped kitchen. Large working space. Massive wardrobe. And perfect location! We could just walk around and lots of food options. We enjoyed ourselves a lot!
Had my 3 days 2 nights staycation there.   Room is super spacious and i feel like i am home whenever i enter the room!  Bathroom is the hardest to maintain but the bathroom is sparkling clean and amazing. (the amenities smells good too!)  A special shout out for Pey Si (reservation member) for assisting my booking and Cindy (FO) helping me bout the check in.  both of them are very friendly and nice.  Thank you ParkRoyal for making my day :)  p/s : just that the TV channel are bit blur
Excellent & friendly staffs.  Very clean and spacious rooms.  A great place for families as wel.  There are many shops near by to dine in or you can also cook there . Its very convenient. The pool oversees the KL Tower and its very pretty at night.     Highly recommended to stay here  also value for money which i dont think you can get this kind of rate with the suite you stay in . Its totally awesome !
"Superb stay and Staff friendliness, they will help and guide you throughout your stay and even their friendliness maintained when you have checked out. All of the locations are just stone's throw away and it is easy to navigate through the city"
"We went as a family of 3 (my husband and I along with our 9-month old baby). Check in was good. The room is very spacious and clean. Location is very strategic. Parking is very easy as well. Staff are friendly though I think there‚Äôs a shortage of staff because when we arrived at our room, we noticed that there are no toothbrushes so we asked for them only to receive them then next morning. Also, we were informed during check in that their breakfast lounge is not opened and there‚Äôs no room service as well (probably due to the pandemic). Nonetheless, we have a wonderful staycation and were sad to leave once our trip is over."
"I spent 3 months in their one bed room apartment as I set up shop in my new city KL   The place is fabulous , amazing location , well appointed rooms, great 360 views from the 28th floor and last but not the least a super duper helpful team   Hospitality is people business and the property is blessed with some amazing service warriors, in the face of a COVID inflicted body blow which has impacted life‚Äôs and livelihoods they are serving customers with a smile and making everyday easy for their guests   I will be going back after my year end holiday and promptly sign up for a long term stay with them in a heat beat   One of the best places in KL..a gem that I will recommend always to fellow travellers and long term renters   I am super impressed!"
"We checked in Parkroyal over the weekend for one night stay. Room 706. The room was spacious but we didnt get the higher floor as per request. At the bottom of the sofa seat, we found rice all over and cleaning cloth on the TV table.. Didnt expect this but overall it was good given the price that we pay for. Free parking and walking distance to Pavilion."
"Our family members stayed two nights there and all of us were more than satisfied with their all services. Room was not only spacious, but also very well organized. For example, Kitchen is located really convinient place in this unit,  kitchen itself had a wonderful flow line that made it easy to do household  job. (Ricecooker was also set up!) Laundry area  was also spacious and handy to use(after swiming at pool, we can use it for spin our swimming suits and dry up very easily).  Breakfast was amazing!  We chose American breakfast(RM15 per person), and we were surprised at them as they were delivered to our room unit(Because of current situation, cafe area is now closed. Staff kindly delivered to each guests unit every morning!). Absolutely It was worth more than their price!"
"Book 2 bedroom during my stay. 2nd room ac not working and hot shower also problem during my stay, the technician came aftermy 2nd complain but unable to fix.  Stay for 1 night and check out and look for other hotel."
"With the Covid situation worsening in USA, our son decided to return to Malaysia after finishing his undergraduate study at USC Los Angeles.   Upon entering Malaysia, he was asked to serve 14 day Stay Home Notice by the Government.   As we did not want the grandparents to be exposed to him, we decided to get him to stay at a KL hotel.  The hotel we chose was Parkroyal Serviced Suite KL.  The suite room is spacious and neat.  There is a small kitchen and living hall, so plenty of room for him to do some simple cooking and stretching his muscles.    All were good, until he developed some fever on the 5th day of his stay there.  All of us were getting panic as we could not attend to him since we were actually living in Singapore.   He tried to call the government body to seek help,"
I spent 3 nights here and I found this amazing. Public transport including metro and KL free bus is just next to this hotel. Also Bukit Bintang is just a walk away. The hotel rooms are spacious and have all amenities. The staff is courteous and helpful. If I visit again then definately I will stay here. The only challange is vegetarian food which I think very hard to find in any hotel of MY.
"My husband and I have been staying at Parkroyal Service Suites KL every Dec since it's opening. The last 3 years we spent 3 months from Dec to March there. It has always been like our second home. This round back had been a special year, with renovations in the premises, and the beginning of the outbreak of Covid 19. But inspite of encountering some inconveniences, we really enjoyed our stay. All thanks to the Front Desk staff, esp Siti with her humorous and cheerful character,it made our days shine. She can joke n work at the same time. Admirable! Kamarul, Cindy, Ezaham and Siva are capable of handling straight away all problems. Daran and Firdaus are always very attentive especially making sure we have our dose of coffee. A big thanks to everyone of the staff including those"
"The Parkroyal serviced suites wasn't a hotel for us. It was home for about 4 months when I was working there.  When I checked in at the Parkroyal, it was like entering a hotel. When I left, it was like leaving friends and a temporary home that we will always have fond memories of.  I chose this place because of its strategic location. It was hardly 2kms from my office, so my office commute was an absolute breeze. But it also has a lot of other things working for it. It's in the heart of the touristy Bukit Bintang with a lot of things at walking distance. Changkat, a party street packed with pubs is a few minutes walk while some of their best malls, KLCC and Pavilion are barely a 10-15 min walk away. The area is packed with restaurants and you can get different kinds of cuisines"
Great service from the staff. Excellent location and convenient even if you have a family member who is using a wheelchair. There is a halal indian stall selling indian food located just infront of the property. It's easy & not expensive to use Grab to get to any tourist spots from the property. The apartment itself is huge! Comfortable bed! And the breakfast is fantastic!
"Best location in Bukit Bintang, you can walk allmost to all sightseeing. Staff was very friendly, everything worked fine. Room, Premium suite, was little worn out but clean and tidy. Good bed. Infinity pool was great, but dirty windows block best views. Breakfast was okey, but missing good sets of cheese, sausages and vegetables. Ehdottomasti paras sijainti Bukit Bintangissa, l√§hes jokaiselle n√§ht√§vyydelle p√§√§si k√§vellen. Henkil√∂kunta oli yst√§v√§llist√§ ja kaikki toimi hyvin. Huone oli hieman kulunut, mutta puhdas ja siisti. Hyv√§ s√§nky. Kattoallas oli hyv√§ mutta likaiset ikkunat peitti parhaat n√§kym√§t. Aamiainen oli ihan hyv√§ mutta j√§in laipaamaan leikkeleit√§, juustoja ja vihanneksia."
"The room was great and spacious. I was given a room on the highest floor (level 30). The only things that need to be improve is the check-in process and the food (too bland and tasteless). Other than that, everything was fine."
"Stayed at the Park Royal Service Suites Kuala Lumpur a few times part of my memorable and unforgettable experiences. Since arrival they have been provided us room on same floor which I don‚Äôt need waiting for the room. Location was perfect walk away 5 minutes to the main attractions on the Bukit Bintang. But this time, I would like to give compliment indeed  Siti (Front Office Assistant) who is very service minded down to detail and provide us extra bed and baby cot. A million thanks to Rajan(Porter) always helpful anytime when we need assistance and he very knowledgeable all surrounding city area. Send my regards to them. All in all, Park Royal Service Suites Kuala Lumpur is one of the best choice hotel. See you soon guys, Congrats guys!üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª"
"We stayed in a 3 bedroom corner apartment on a higher floor. The view was quite nice.  They supply free water bottles for each person, have a full functional kitchen and  supply general bathroom amenities. There is a laundry and dryer inside as well but they do not supply detergent. However 7/11 is just next door and a small pack of cleaning detergent costs around RMB 2. There were some maintenance issues with the shower not working and the bathroom sink not draining.  Staff were generally friendly. One or two at the front were not that helpful when we asked for late check out and so waited for the shift to change and asked again. We were happy to pay a small amount to check out at 7pm. Breakfast is average. They probably need more staff to assist in clearing tables and sweeping"
This hotel was like a mini apartment fully equipped with everything you need from kitchens to laundry room great for family or large party and it‚Äôs in a prime location near all the popular food streets and shopping center so close you can either walk or rent a scooter and ride around high recommended and also very comfortable only thing is breakfast is not that good and runs out quite often besides that I would highly recommend this hotel. Also close to 7/11 and other restaurants.
"I was here last year and I came back for my staycation. I was check in by Ezham‚Äôs with his friendly smile as usual. I was greeted by surprised with the Housekeeping team (Quest, Fara and Eira) with my amazing and thoughtful decoration in my room. The hotel location was perfect. The hidden gem was the stall behind the hotel was selling ‚Äúikan Bakar‚Äù grilled fish was fantastic. Is a must try when you visit the place. Overall I‚Äôm happy with my room and the service from the team."
"Overall I had an awesome weekend with my family check-in and check-out attended by Farid who carry a right attitude as front liner THANKS Farid!. Meanwhile Shamsul who attended my call have to implement his communication skills. Location was great easy access to shopping mall around KL, Nice pool we had fun there as my niece so happy with Jacuzzi!"
"This old stalwart is showing its age, however still holds its own in terms of the serviced apartment offering in this part of KL.   The floor plan of the apartments are well proportioned and make for a comfortable stay.  From housekeeping to the front desk, the customer service can‚Äôt be faulted, with particular mention to Ian who was very accommodating in facilitating ad hoc requests.   Facilities-  The buffet breakfast offering is average but in saying that, it‚Äôs on par with other 4 star establishments in Malaysia.  The pool and gym facilities are satisfactory with dumbbells up to 25kg.   You‚Äôd be doing well to find something else in the area that represents value for money like this property. If you prefer a newer more modern complex, take a look at the nearby TriBecca.   A"
"While the hotel check in time is at 14:00; I arrived at 15:15 but I was left waiting in the lobby for 1 hour and 15 minutes to get my room.  The reason given by the clerk is that the room is not ready. If you allow your customers to have a late check out which is what I suppose happened; you have to make sure that you have available rooms for the customers who will check in that day.  Obviously, I had to report my meeting due to this delay."
Stayed here 5 nights. Great location by the monorail station ( a few stops to KL Sentral ) and to shopping malls. Walking distance to Petronius Towers. Supermarkets close by too.   The hotel has a nice modern feel. GREAT breakfast and lovely staff. Even made spring rolls especially as my partner loved them. Reception staff efficient and friendly too.  Our room was spacious and modern. It was great relaxing in the evening. Well equipped kitchen and very comfy bed. Lovely bathroom. Only reason I have given this hotel 4 out of 5 is that the room was quite tired with a stained carpet and marked walls.   Would stay here again however as everything else and the staff were just great!!
"The staffs were very approachable, genuinely friendly and helpful. The Studio Suite Room, bedding and bathroom clean and with comfortable furniture and bed was comfortable too. Big room and bathroom with all quality necessities. Lots of parking. The location of the hotel is excellent, very peaceful night waking to all shopping mall (Pavilion Shopping Mall, Lot 10 & Farenheit) and easy to look for foods surround the hotel area especially Alor Food Street, Changkat night life & Arab Street). Great value, highly recommend and will definitely stay again when visiting the area."
"Right so we arrived a bit early and they said room is not ready and they are full so we have to wait 4hrs but then after I said we had a 12hr flight with 2 kids somehow a room became available!!! So I was happy, once entered the room there was only 1 double bed!!! When I called the reception they said 2 people can sleep on the sofa, I couldn't believe this. We travel 3 or 4 times a year and at least once to KL and this is the 1st time we were asked to sleep on the sofa when we clearly made a booking for 4 people so be aware. Then she said we can send you 2 single beds for RM60 so I said ok and at check out they charged RM60 for every night which they never told us. Rooms are very old, the air conditioning making noise all night and they are positioned so they can blow on you"
"There was a buuzz sound in our room it was really noisy we asked for help they send there technical man at 10 am he said its a big problem and need to come back to fix it later we sad ok we are leaving soon , so we did came back with my family to the room at 7:30pm to find out the electricity is not working , and the electric box was open  Call the front desk,they sent someone and asked us to change the room because of his friend‚Äôs unfinished job ,, we were tired to pack our bags  We paid for bad communication between the technicians and gust services  Staying at this hotel was A MISTAKE"
"We stayed two nights in a one bedroom - biggest hotel suite that we stayed in malaysia, was clean, freindly service, this hotel was exceptional, Within walking distance to cbd- petronas towers, the pavillion shopping, restaurants and bars and eat street."
Excellent location close enough to the centre of Kuala Lumpur whilst also close to night food market and pub street. Large room with a comfortable bed and good breakfast. We had a very comfortable stay.
"I stay with my wife and 5yr son. Location are good, i can walk to pavilion mall. Swimming Pool closed at 8pm as i remember. Spacious room. And kitchen utensil is quite complete. But breakfast can be better."
"We discovered the serviced apartments some years ago and is still our first choice when staying in kl.  sadly after a long journey our room wasn't ready although we arrived a couple of hours after checking in time. BUT although very busy at the front desk and with a big boss hanging around directing staff whilst they swapped Xmas for Chinese New Year , Ian ( not his real name I guess) was so very helpful apologetic . We had our cab waiting as we had plans to meet family for supper. All we needed was to freshen up a bit which Ian helped us with. Stored our bags in the office and got us access to freshen ourselves a bit so we could run back out as the room was being dealt with. Our son couldn't wait and headed across the road to get some local food ( roti canai) instead of eating"
"Location: Situated near The Petronas Twin Towers and can be reached by foot for about 10 to 15 minutes. There are also malls and restaurants within the vicinity;  Lobby: Comfortable seats with complimentary refreshments;  Reception: Accommodating and courteous staff;  Two Bedroom Suite: The unit is really complete (aside from that there are no food and laundry soap). The living room is spacious with a sofa set, an LED TV (not a smart-tv though), and a DVD/Radio player.  Adjacent to the living room is the dining room that has a 6-seater table with comfortable chairs.  The kitchen has a refrigerator (not just the usual minibar-sized fridge), microwave/oven-combo, sink, rice cooker, coffee maker, a stove and utensils.  There are 2 bathrooms and 2 bedrooms.  The office is not just a"
"Our experience  of the ParkRoyal differs from that of many of the reviewers. We had a one bedroom apartment which was clean and spacious. The bathroom had a large bath and separate shower cubicle and was tastefully decorated. The bedroom had a comfortable bed and adequate storage. The choice for breakfast was extensive to cater to all culinary tastes. The hotel location couldn't be better for tourists with many shopping malls, bars and restaurants within walking distance. Petronas towers and KL tower are around 20 minutes walk away or you can catch the free GO KL bus to these attractions. We only spent 2 nights at the hotel but would happily return again as our overall experience was a satisfying one. Highly recommended."
"Only location was perfect. Other than that, ceiling was leaking, linens, carpet and towels were dirty, discolored and dusty, furniture and lights were broken, breakfast was one of the worst i have experienced."
"Furnishing is Old, towels were yellow and torn, coffee machine at check in counter never works, breakfast over crowded and waited for 20 mins. Tables were dirty and smelly. Paid for Starbucks coffee but machine didn‚Äôt produce coffee."
"Except for the location this hotel is a total waste of money.Food is terrible,don‚Äôt opt for breakfast if you r staying.Service totally disappointing.Some Furnitures are in partially broken state better check before sitting ,other wise they will charge for the repairing cost.Hotel manager not at all friendly.Better hotels nearby don‚Äôt waste money here."
"Firstly , great location , near Pavilion centre and waking distance to all malls , plenty food options etc  Rooms are large , estimate 35-40 m2 and has everything , kitchen lounge etc  Suites are serviced and staff are functional  Need improvements in the breakfast area as there are long lines to be seated and even longer lines at the Egg üç≥ Station  Also TV‚Äôs are dated more than 10 years old so HD not available  Apart from these minor drawbacks- great stay , location and staff"
Stay away until they change the entire management and re-do the entire property. I am surprised Park Royal and Pan Pacific associate their brand with this place. Poor service. Even basic amenities and services are not forthcoming.
"We were travelling with family and had kids and elderly. Booked 2 2-bedroom apartments for 3 nights. Arrived at about 4.15pm to check in and the rooms were not ready. Kept telling us that housekeeping is checking on the status of the room. After waiting for 30 mins, we asked to refund so that we could go look for another hotel. My kids were tired and wanted to shower so we really just wanted to check into a hotel. They finally gave us our rooms at 5pm, after an almost 1-hr wait! Got into the rooms and it smelt abit stale. But that was ok. At least we got our rooms.   Asked for extra towels, blanket and toothbrush and it took a very long time. We went out for dinner and as I was going out, I asked the front desk again. The staff said that the housekeeping staff is on his way and"
We stayed as a couple in a Studio Suite King for 5 days. We have traveled to Kuala Lumpur many times but this was our first time stay at the Park Royal Serviced Apartments. The hotel is located within walking distance to the Raja Chulan Monorail and just around the corner is bus stop (KL9) the free purple line shuttle bus. A taxi rank is located in the front of the hotel. There are numerous restaurants/eateries and bars within walking distance.  There is a convenience store located next door. (Would highly recommend the Indian restaurant directly across the road).  Changkat Bukit Bintang known as the‚Äù bar street‚Äù is 2 mins walk away and Jalan Alor Night market is also within easy walking distance.  The reception staff was pleasant and welcoming. Nothing seemed a problem. Our
Great and will go back again. Overall this is a good hotel for indivual or familly stay. The hotel room is clean and tidy. Most of of required facilities were setup and available in the room. The staff working here is helpful especially the  housekeeping service. I am impressed that the room is spacious and comfotable. Kitchen in the room also convenient to have simple dining in room.
"There are certainly better hotels around. We had 2 rooms for 3 nights. Night 1: Sink stopper was jammed. Service crew came and fixed it with tools. Daughter wanted to sleep on the sofa, so we asked for blanket and 2 pillows. Took a long time for someone to turn up with a can of air freshener (Mdm, you called about a foul smell?) After clarifying what we wanted, they took another long period of time to come with the pillows and blanket. Day 1: We were told only 2 breakfasts were provided for our room. Had to pay our child's. Paid RM20+ for her to have an egg and a glass of water. Breakfast choices very limited and guests were fighting for the food like it was going to run out any second. Day 2 and Day 3 We did not go down for breakfast at all.  Nights 1 and 2: Couldn't sleep well"
"We stayed in the 2 bedroom apartment which comes with a study room. We had everything in the room. Washer, dryer, rice cooker and even laundry rack to hang your clothes. The staff are all very attentive and helpful. We stayed for 4 nights and really wished we could extend our stay. The location is walking distance to Pavilion mall and there's 7-11 beside the hotel. Plenty of bars and restaurants outside the hotel as well. Overall would definitely be back again sooner rather than later."
"The hotel is centrally located in downtown KL and close to loads of restaurants and night life. I found the front desk staff helpful and attentive with service comparable to an international level hotel. My room was spacious and ideal for a week‚Äôs stay and the wi-fi was strong and consistent. The kitchen was decently stocked for in-room dining and the various spaces within the room felt private and spacious.   The hotel gym is rather small for the size of the hotel especially that the hotel is targeting the extended stay market. That said, I was easily able to run to the KLCC park which made up for the pokey gym.   The only real letdown was an average breakfast. There was nothing wrong with my breakfast- being a ParkRoyal property I just expected something a little better.   For"
"We were given a room on the 19th floor. After an hour there, we realized that the constant loud noise was not decreasing or stopping. Since ours was a 5 day stay here we decided it was better to change room or get the sound fixed. We called the reception. He said the sound was from next-door room‚Äôs ac. He then talked to someone on phone, said we need to pack our luggage, and would be given a different room.  Cindy helped us by shifting us to the 17th floor family suite 1702. We were given a free upgrade.  Keeping this incidence apart, the room and stay was good. Our earlier room had partial view of Petronas and our later room had a good view of KL Tower. The Ac, fridge and other amenities were ok and toiletries provided apart from toothbrush and toothpaste.Umbrellas, Safety"
"The hotel is in a convenient location for family and taken Parkroyal as a reputable brand. Unfortunately, our family was taken back by its poor management of the place. The rooms are dirty, we found our original room to be dirty esp. carpet, walls, essentials, etc. But, it was no difference when we changed to other rooms. Also, breakfast spread were poor and service near to none.  During check-in, I asked reception if they could instate my stay onto their club membership (since I had one), surprisingly the staff couldn't understand what I was asking for. Upon my returned, I had wrote in for the stay claim - to date I have not received any reply (over two weeks now). Poor management, untrained staffs, bad service orientation, everything else that a bad hotel can offer. Strongly"
"The property is located within small lanes away from the main busy streets of bukit bintang. It is within walking distance to Pavilion mall (about 10 mins) and the malls along bukit bintang ( about 10-15 mins); but there will be slopes and small alleys that one will need to pass by. You can call grab costing about RM30 to reach to mid-valley and RM15 to Berjaya Time Square.   We stayed in a family suite: 3 bedrooms (double queen , queen bed and 1 single bed).  the layout of the unit was pretty good. The unit comes with a laundry area (with washing machine), a small dinning area,  a reasonable size kitchen (with some cooking utensils), a living room with sofa and study table, 1 common toilet, and a toilet in the master room. master room and living room had TVs.  Despite a small"
"This is my 3rd stay at this friendly property. Very efficient check in and the rooms are very spacious.  The hotel is in the hottest spot in town, hence you will find several outlets, supermarkets, mini marts still open 24 Hours.  Love the new STARBUCKS coffee kiosk in the lobby.  Special thanks to the management for all the arrangements."
"It was a great staycations in the hotels. Checking in proses was smooth even i had to re-book my room due cancellation reason card is not same with the booker name. Just experienced this situation here but in others hotel all seems okay. My 2 bedroom suite was big and fully equipped by kitchen set. But a bit disappointed when i found left over 2 slice of bread inside the bread toaster, the refrigerator also have some dirty, and my second bedroom have so many dust on the wall. I had inform the front desk about my room and had requested to be clean room. Mr Firdaus the front desk was friendly and had help me to inform housekeeping to attend my room and did follow up with me regarding all the matters. Breakfast are good and maybe can add some more choices. The swimming pool at"
Great place.  Friendly staff.  Great location. The restaurant breakfast was below average.  It did not include enough traditional Malaysian food. And the selections were not enough.  Reception was very cooperative
Very good and convenience. All hotel staff were friendly  and provide assistance when required. The location is convenience and easy accessable to town.  Food  also convenience around the area ans supermart is just  next to hotel lobby.
"A reasonable distant to walk to all the main shopping and eating places. Spacious room with cooking appliance which is good for family trips. Only down side is that the curtains are a little old and dirty and the breakfast selection is quite limited, except for the wide variety of breads :)  Overall was a good and happy experience. Great stay, cosy room and comfortable."
"I was travelling with my family and I really had a great time here. The location was just perfect. The apartment was located just a walking distance from all the major attractions. The room was spacious and loaded with facilities and a 7/11 nearby made it very convenient for the people with small kids. The staff was co-operative and helpful. They even arranged an early check-in. Breakfast was also good.   There were just 2 small bottles of complimentary water. I had to run every now and then to get more water. Also, I did not like the swimming pool much."
"Stayed here for the first time last week, the staff were all great, friendly and extremely accommodating. Room was clean, spacious (1 bedroom suite). Roof top pool was fantastic, great views! Would recommend for families."
"Sam, Anna and Ian always make me feel like I have just returned home. Great staff always looking after me. Great prices and fantastic location. Everywhere is accessible by foot here in Bukit Bintang. Great food and bars."
"Enjoyed my stay here as a base to attend the MotoGP, plus near to local bars and restaurants hotel was ok, staff at the hotel found to be helpful and very polite during the day or evening, only problem was the steam room not working properly."
In need of a touch of paint photos are old. Temperature never gets below 28 in room. Breakfast good plenty choice. Pool view very nice from room. Gym could be a little cooler very hard to run in the heat
Breakfast no option although there was a lot of complains  Air conditioning was leaking and got fixed  Soundproof glass for rooms as you can hear outside traffic  Location is good Staff is good specially Jan from
"very nice room, cozy studio type, with island kitchen and excellent shower. Only limit of washer and dryer, need to take long queue for laundry. staff is friendly, cheerful and helpful. Already recommend this hotel to friends and families."
"Arrived at hotel and taxi took over an 2 hour as location is so busy. Hotel is run down apartments are run down, we had leaking water pipes that we had put towels down, the  AC was so noisy we had keep turn them of as gave you a headache  Location I think  let‚Äôs just say men would really like this area there are ladies on corners and bars everywhere. The breakfast we walked out it was awful, sorry,  but it was, there was flies in food. We walked out and walked the mall and ate there  The room unfortunately is full mosquitos, do take repellent  My son cut open his foot on a RUSTY. Nail and had to attend the AE and have a tenus injection.  But the hotel took responsibility of it as it was on a nail at the pool at there premises. they took us to the hospital and looked after us."
"Very nice suites with impeccable service. While we were given a complimentary upgrade from 1 bedroom to 2 bedroom suite, we were denied late checkout citing hotel being full (it wasnt) so it was a bit of a mixed experience there.  The housekeeping, cleanliness and quality of furnishings and toiletries were par excellence. The only complaint possibly was the doors of the bedrooms and washrooms didnt close properly. In fact one of the bathrooms had a broken door handle, so there is some room for improvement there. Overall we were delighted with our stay there and would recommend the place to one and all."
"Centrally located and close to Indian restaurants. Apartments have basic amenities including a small kitchen where one can re-heat or cook basic meals. Rooms are spacious. Staff is friendly, helpful and prompt. Has a business center where basic services like internet access, printouts, etc are free. Breakfast buffet has some Veg options."
"We had an excellent time with great service and particular personal attention to every detail.  The staff were great, the hotel very clean and facilities were excellent.  I would strongly recommend this hotel"
"Well located. Plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby.   We were only in Kuala Lumpur for about 24 hours and most of those were out exploring the city, the Batu caves, and visiting the Kuala Selagor firefly park. Unfortunately didn't have time for the pool nor did we use the on-site restaurant.   Lobby... Lobby was nice enough though a bit on the large and empty side. Small area with a couple chairs/sofas off in a corner. Could be a bit design and decor to it. A bit more ""welcoming"" perhaps. Feels more like walking into an office building than a hotel.   Check in... Standard check in. We had no wait. Staff was pleasant enough  Took care of the paperwork and we were on our way   Rooms... I'm not sure where the terms ""apartment/flat"" end or where  the term ""suite"" picks up, but"
"This property is located within the golden triangle of Kuala Lumpur. We booked three room suite and it comes all furnished. Just carry your bag in. The kitchen is fully furnished with utensils. Hair dryer, washing machine and dryer are available. Water pressure is good and a/c works well  There is a convenience store located at ground floor."
"Wow, big spacious clean suites. Great breakfast, gorgeous sky top pool with views. 5 stars all day.  Can't think of any faults this place is amazing. Great value for the family. There also a 7/elven next door for snacks. Can easier get a grab anywhere. We will stay here again. Highly recommended"
"PROS  The hotel is in a good spot. Lots of great places to eat nearby & 24 hour mini marts close by. The rooms are spacious & staff are friendly.  CONS  This place needs a refurbishment, well our room did anyway, mismatched tiles in bathrooms, floor boards in bedroom lifting,   wear marks on the lounges &  just appeared quite worn. The corridors are really hot. walking from your room is like walking through a sauna and the smell of stale tobacco in the corridor was disgusting. Breakfast was very basic and food temperatures were concerning to me. I'll leave it there."
"2 nights - 1 Bedroom Premier apartment - 350RM per night  The location is about a 7 minute walk to Jalan Bukit Bingtang. It is very close to the tourist entertainment district with lots of nightlife and bars closeby. Jalan Alor is within 5 minutes.  The reception staff was extremely cheerful, helpful and polite. The room was very spacious but there were signs of wear and tear. There was a good size kitchenette where small meals could be prepared. The rooftop pool and 1st floor pool/gym were very practical and welcomed. Self serviced laundry facilities were also available.   Breakfast was served on the ground floor behind reception. A basic hot/cold spread with moderate selection was provided and satisfactory. There are many cheap local breakfast places within 5 minutes so hotel"
"Outstanding service provider from an serviced apartment hotel... Rooms are spacious and clean.. Staff very courteous and polite. Nice location.. Just few minutes to Bukit Bintang... Thank you Siti,Cindy and Marvin."
"Stayed three night st the parkroyal in a three bedroom apartment, it was a good size for 6 people, room was clean, beds were probably a bit hard for us but that more personal choice. The games  room was a great hot with the kids an a great addition to hotel. The only thing letting down our stay was the breakfast, very plain limited choice and was running out of food.  It's location is amazing 4 malls within a block really, a grab to Chinatown only 15 riggit, and there is amazing street food just around the corner!"
"i had a short stay this time which is only for 1 night stay but still memorable. Eventhough i miss the old team impeccable hospitality (Tay, Dayana, Raziman and Syazwan) , but the receptionist named Ian Tan made my short stay this time memorable. Ian was very helpful and polite as well as calling me by my name, IMPRESSIVE!"
"I booked a room for the Studio Suite on sale, but the room was on the higher floors. The room fixtures and amenities were perfect, the bathroom was clean and the bathtub was on. The location is very convenient with walking distance to the city center, and you can get to Central in about 10 minutes by using Glab. View of cost performance, it was the highest ever.  „Çª„Éº„É´‰∏≠„ÅÆStudio Suite„ÅÆÈÉ®Â±ã„Çí‰∫àÁ¥Ñ„Åó„Åæ„Åó„Åü„Åå„ÄÅÈ´òÂ±§Èöé„ÅßÈÉ®Â±ã„ÇÇÂ∫É„ÅèÊúÄÈ´ò„Åß„Åó„Åü„ÄÇÈÉ®Â±ã„ÅÆÂÇôÂìÅ„ÇÇ„Ç¢„É°„Éã„ÉÜ„Ç£„ÇÇÁî≥„ÅóÂàÜ„Å™„Åè„ÄÅ„Éê„Çπ„É´„Éº„É†„ÇÇÊ∏ÖÊΩî„Åß„Éê„Çπ„Çø„Éñ„ÇÇ„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ„É≠„Ç±„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥„ÇÇÂ∏ÇÂÜÖ‰∏≠ÂøÉÈÉ®„Å´ÂæíÊ≠©Âúè„Å®ÈùûÂ∏∏„Å´‰æøÂà©„Åß„ÄÅ„Çª„É≥„Éà„É©„É´„Åæ„Åß„ÇÇGlab„Çí‰Ωø„Åà„Å∞10ÂàÜÁ®ãÂ∫¶„ÅßÁùÄ„Åè„Åì„Å®„Åå„Åß„Åç„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ„Ç≥„Çπ„Éë„ÅßË®Ä„Åà„Å∞ÈÅéÂéªÊúÄÈ´ò„Åß„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ"
"We booked this hotel after reading other Trip advisor reviews but remained slightly apprehensive until we arrived. We need not have worried. We got a grab from the airport (4 people 4 cases) for a total of 114 RM. The hotel is in a great location pretty central to every aminety. A 7 eleven just opened next door to. Our suite had two bedrooms but another room had a bed settee so really 3 bedrooms. We had a fully equipped kitchen, two bathrooms and a laundry room with washer and dryer. We were very comfortable throughout our stay. The hotel facilities are excellent also two pools, jacuzzi, gym and steam room. Rooftop pool was particularly beautiful at night with a view of the Petronas Towers. Breakfast was very good also, something different everyday. We wholeheartedly recommend"
"Best locations for the bars (one huge street of bars) 300m away, huge street food (Jalan alor) 3/5mins away. Free bus stop (bukit bingtang) 3min away. Underground station (bukit bingtang) 4mins away.  Also use grab, DO NOT TAKE ANY OTHER TAXIS !! They are awful only use grab .  To and from the airport should be between 65-80 no more !!!!"

"The room is large and spacious with fully equipped kitchen. There's a big bathroom with both shower and bath tub. There's also a spacious family area to watch television. Overall, everything is good except the variety of food for breakfast is very little."
"We really enjoyed our 9-night stay here at Parkroyal serviced suites. Location was perfect close to twin towers, pub street, Jalan Alor, Pavillion etc, couldn't fault it as you could easily walk to everything with young kids. the rooms were really great and spacious, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, lounge dining, and a spare room, aircon worked well with aircon's in every room, and a laundry room, with washer and dryer. rooms were cleaned daily and to a high standard. the pool on the 31st floor was nice, but strangely water was cold, probably due to the shade cover. the breakfast was fine, with a choice of bread, eggs, porridge, fruit and a selection of Asian hot dishes. breakfast gets busy from 9.30am, getting their earlier makes it a lot more enjoyable. taxi rank outside the"
"This is my second (but definitely not last) visit to this property. Having stayed here before, I knew what type of suite I wanted to book and opted for the one bedroom premier. Well worth it as it comes with a comfortable sitting room and kitchen with a separate bedroom. The only difference this time round is that I'm on the 29th rather than the 25th floor but hey, it's good to travel and the views are amazing.  The check in took no time at all and it was great to see the same friendly team I remembered from my previous visit. You'll read from the other reviews how amazing the pools are and I can never get tired of lying by the pool looking at the KL tower. It's also a great place to be when the sun goes down as you see the city start to light up around you.  Breakfast is"
"Pros-ParkRoyal SS has their staff to thank ,for me to rate it a 6-star accomodation. Front desk staff especially Suihaimi(Sam) is really very professional at his job and made our visit a very pleasant one.Malvin at Front desk too, is very helpful throughout our short stay.  Raju from Housekeeping never fails to bring a smile to our face each time we bump into him at the hallway, he even went out of his way to place flowers on our bed knowing that it will be our last night there. Susanti , fr Housekeeping, i think was a great help to me at the laundry room. Daran from Concierge was ever so welcoming evytime we step into the building. Ms Nurhafizah from Sales dept was ever so ready to welcome us back again. Such hospitality are certainly worth mentioning. Cons- would be nice to"
"We thought we had booked the ParkRoyal hotel, but were quickly corrected by the reception staff.  The suites are just a few hundred metres away but trying to get there by car was a nightmare because of all the one-way streets (although taxi-drivers manage it without difficulty).  We were pleasantly surprised when we finally arrived.  The reception is manned but otherwise unimpressive, and there is a ground floor restaurant, which is quite cheap (but eat in the street, the food is better). The suite was large and cleverly laid out, with a bath and a separate shower, and the bed positioned in the middle of the room to minimise noise from adjacent suites. Having siad that the suite was very quiet.  It had a small kitchen and a safe.  The bed was large and comfortable, and the air"
I liked the place very much with their two swimming pools especially the one on 31st floor only the are poor in breakfast variety of food since they have nothing middle eastern or Arabian food though of the good Nos of guests there
"The GOOD  Spacious room. The largest I've been with all the amenities like cooking tools., plates etc.  Reception service is nice. Check in and check out was a breeze. The location is near everything. Like 24 hour convenience stores, eateries, night market.   The Bad  Duvet sheets and pillow case have stains. We request to change it but they replace it with yet another stained sheets.  The smell is supposed to be fresh linens but that was not the case. It makes us very uncomfortable and not able to get a good sleep.  The place is dated, the room itself is definitely not well maintained.  The toilet flush was not working and we have to call the maintenance to fix it.  The AC drips water and it was very noisy.   There were stains on the bathtub, the tiles are wore off. The carpet"
"The GOOD  Room is very very spacious with all the serviceable amenities including the cooking tools, plates etc.  Largest room I've ever been.  Reception and staff were warm and welcoming.  Check in and check out was a breeze. The location good.  It is near a lot of 24 hours convenient store and coffee shops. It's near the night market as well.   The BAD  The hotel looks dated and needs some serious renovation.  Issue with cleanliness, a lot of stains on the duvet cover and pillow case. We requested to change it but they changed to ones with stains as well. The smell of the sheets are also not ok.  Hallway was not air conditioned, you will literally sweat while waiting for the elavator.  The toilet flush was NOT working, we have to asked maintenance to fix it and it took a lot"
I am a regular in this place as it is a preferred accommodation for my monthly business trip to KL.  The service used to be good although the facility is so-so.  This stay however was horrible.  The cleaner seemed to be vandalizing my room whenever I was not around.  Food quality has become so poor!  Only the reception people is quite good.
"Location is good - staff is always available and welcoming. Hotel is definitely not a 5 star hotel given the poorness if the rooms/furnitures. Breakfast space was too small to accommodate everybody, breakfast quality and offering was also poor.  It definitely needs a serious refurbishment - bathroom full with fungus (see pictures) not healthy especially with young kids."
Location is at the center.  Very well mannered staffs. Rooms are spacious. Me and my wife had a very memorable stay. Rooftop swimming pool was cool with a pleasant view. Breakfast was not upto the mark. Overall we had a wonderful time.
Bad experience  Rooms are so small No view Check in was terrible Staff were unprofessional Phone was not working  Old furniture Restaurant was too crowded because it is small tables too close to each other .
"These serviced suites are right in the centre of the golden triangle in Bukit Bintang.  We walked everywhere when we were in KL because of this excellent location.  Pavillion Mall, Lot 10 and the KL tower were all reached within 5 minutes walking.  Time Square took us 10 minutes walking.  We even walked to the twin towers, which took about 20 minutes in an air conditioned walkway. I cannot praise the location enough really. We booked a 2 bedroom suite which was excellent.  There was 1 king room with ensuite, 1 double room and then another room with a double sofa bed, which they made up properly so we used it as a third bedroom. There is a full kitchen with fridge freezer and everything you need (except a colander/sieve).  They even provided washing up liquid, sponge and tea"
"The hotel was fine and the staff were mostly friendly and helpful. However, the breakfast was unsatisfactory as the variety was so little and the food refill was so slow. Even the coffee machine was out of work."
"Excellent service, as expected from any Parkroyal property. The upkeep was just above average with the smell of cigarettes in the corridor, and a leaky health faucet. The breakfast was fine. Speaking of the location, away from the Bintang traffic chaos, walking distance to excellent street food options and a monorail station. While booking a cab, make sure to emphasize ""Suites."" There is another Parkroyal in the same area."
"These suites were more that big enough for the two of us, the kitchenette could come in handy for a longer stay, we were there 4 nights, the only downside would be the lack of cooking pots, they were limited but still functional. The reception staff were lovely and helpful, especially with helping me after I had hurt myself. No view to speak of from our room but not a big deal. Two pools to choose from and the neither overly busy, the rooftop pool was virtually empty most nights and watching the lights on KL Tower were nice while relaxing on the recliners! Breakfast was ok, bit repetitive but they cater to everyone with a large selection of worldwide dishes. The suites are very close to all tourist attractions, Jalan Alor is just around the corner with lots of street stalls to"
I was blown away by these suites. Very nicely appointed and quite sizeable (approx 1000 square feet). The master bedroom was perhaps a slightly odd shape so that it was afforded a window. Actually the second bedroom was nicer but didn‚Äôt have an en suite.   We were on the 30th floor and so had a fabulous view straight out onto the Petronas towers.   Breakfast was better than we had been led to believe. It was described as being a continental breakfast but there were plenty of hot items and an egg station.  Jalan Alor is a short stroll away too.   Staff were friendly and very helpful.   As and when we‚Äôre back in KL we would definitely stay again.
My second time staying here. Super comfy bed and room was big. Location is very near to the shopping mall. Parking is free. Friendly staff especially the receptionist. I hope the breakfast spread can be more variety.
"1. Booked 4 apartment, as i was travelling with my family and requested well in advance for allocating us all the rooms on same floor. Out of our surprise, they allocated rooms to us on 3 different floors.  2. Asked for extra bed sheet and blanket for my son, they gave stained blanket very dirty and blood stained bed sheet.  3. Ordered food from room service, one they have very limited options. Once you recieved the food, it was all cold and tasteless.  4. House keeping doesnt clean the room upon several reminders. They just dont care  I would only recommend this hotel for the location and size of the room."
I had an amazing Suite even though I was alone. Very Reasonably priced and the Staffs are very attentive. The Hotel is close by Major attractions and close to KLCC and Petronas Twin Towers.  Tons of restaurants and Bar within walking distance for those who want to experience the night life in KL. Close to the property is an Arabic restaurant with amazing arrays of Middle Eastern delicacies.  A property very well managed and looking forward to returning with my family. Attached is an image of the new and upcoming Tallest Tower in Malaysia the Tun Abdul Razak Exchange.
"I have went there for Business and stay at Park Royal Suites from 12th to 16th May that week with my wife, so it is a business plus leisure trip. The amenities near the Park Royal Suites are great, not to mention KLCC Mall, Berjaya Square and Yap Ah Loy Street round the corner are great shopping malls and food centres not to be miss. The view of the Twin Towers from KLCC malls and the fountain are great sights. Will definitely be back again."
Very good location .. staff are friendly especially (Iyan ) at the reception. Rooms and bathrooms are clean. Only Need more choices at the breakfast and the fitness center  But it‚Äôs not a big deal Everything was almost perfect.
Wide space and good for 4 persons or more  Good location and close to many attraction places  Brackfast lounge was not as expected at all and it is the worst thing in the hotel  Air conditioning of the master bedroom was not working fine
"For those looking for a good mix of nice stay & a great location, it just cant get better. They provided me a family room for 4 of us - 2 bed room apartment (on the 23rd floor I think) - the view from the rooms was FABULOUS especially at night - the petronas towers could be seen from both the bedrooms. The room was so very spacious, clean, furniture - sofas, tables, fully equipped kitchen. Pretty much everything you could ask for. Breakfast choice is a bit limited but still good enough in terms of quality and taste. Could maybe do better to expand the spread a bit, maybe include an indian breakfast item. the air conditioning took a lot of time to cool on the first day, but rest of the days, it worked pretty fine. Excellent rooftop pool  and jacuzzi - not crowded. very close -"
