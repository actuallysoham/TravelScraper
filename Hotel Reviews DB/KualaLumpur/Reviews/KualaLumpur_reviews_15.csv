The best for me time. I came here for 3 nights stay as my partner was working in Klcc. First  impression truly matters. Staff was pleasant. Hotel is at its finest and clean. Myp room had complete amenities. Lobby was a little hot but I understand  they  are working on the aircond. Pool was overlooking the Kl Towers which I managed to explore. Thank you  Oasia for the memorable stay.
"When is all about staycation, Oasia is my go to. Location was perfect, in the heart of KL surrounded by trees. Walking distance to KL Tower and KL Eco Forest. I truly enjoyed the pool. Overlooking KL Towers. They were generous in hand sanitizer.  The room was very clean. Hskp team did a wonderful job  Bathroom had a great water pressure. . The room size was spacious and with its apartment concept suitable for families and long term guest. The staff is pleasant and accommodating. The hotel is indeed value for money."
"Loved this place! Room was very clean, spacious and airy. Kitchenette and washing machine provided with ample amenities. Pool was great. Reception staff were very friendly. We will definitely come again!"
Great place for a night. My husband and I truly enjoyed this place. Room was spacious and clean. Ample of hand sanitizer available. Staff was amazing. Perfect for couples and a quiet time. Location in the heart of Kl nearby Changkat bukit bintang. See you soon Oasia‚ù§Ô∏è
Lots of ants in kitchen and bedroom was dusty. Requested extra bed but no avail. No aircond at lobby and to queue during registration with no aircond was not ok. First impression i had was a bad feeling
overall I enjoyed my stay at Oasia. I booked 2 bedroom premier suite through Agoda and the suite was so nice & I love it. The KL Tower & KL city view is superb nice. Plus the parking is free for the guest. Will consider this suite for my next staycation.
Floor cleanliness need to upgrade.The carpet also need to check if you bring the child because there were small garbage.Check in lobby quite hard to park when you bring big car also if you order frm grab that used car they will complain about it also haha.
"Very recommended, view from the pool very nice .. i stay on deluxe suite, the facilities also in good condition . They do Cleanliness everyday . I satisfied with the service too ‚ò∫Ô∏è Location a little bit crowded but its okay .. still can access . Thank you . I enjoyed with my trip and will come over again soon ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"I love this place and I felt sad checking out! It was a busy weekend but I manage to get my room on time! I was in Majestic a week ago and I had to wait for three hours just for my room to be ready! The room was super clean and everything was in place from the amenities to the little details in the room . The staff here was super polite and the front office guy Joshua  was extremely helpful even when I lost my keycard!  The girl Komathy who is working at the front office is also very helpful and resourceful!The only downside is the pool area,please check the swimming pool floor as some tiles are coming off and this may be dangerous to the public. Overall it was a fantasy stay. A quiet place in they heart of the city!"
Swimming pool full of guest and most of them with no proper swimsuit . Some of them bring their food along . Management never manage well about this facilities. Especially in this mco period . Swimming pool over crowded
"Stayed in 2 different rooms for 2 nights, ask for even numbered rooms these rooms should have better views, odd numbered rooms face another building which makes the room feels depressing. Good amenities, but overall feels of hotel is just worn."
My children love the pool even the pool size not big enough.  Overall stay was good and will recommend others to choose Oasia for their next trip or vacation. Very besar with KL Tower and easy go get public transport too...
"4 star hotel with 1 star service quality. Upon arrival, there was no one to greet us, there was no bell boy service and I have to carry everything on my own. The lobby was hot because there was no aircon, they forgot to pay the bills apparently. The staff friendliness is equivalent to a zombie. Before I book, I called to ask for the pool schedule, they said its open 7am-7pm, swim anytime with no limit. But its 45min per session. You have to queue to get in and when time is up, they chase you out. Yes its covid season but why give false information to attract guest! The room was not well prepared, no toiletries, no towels, corners of room have thick dust and the ac for my middle room does not work properly. Coming back from dinner, the car park was full, we have to park outside"
Oasia Suites is located at a very strategic location.   We booked a room after reading many rave reviews on the internet (and also because their swimming pool has a nice view of the KL Tower).  However we urge the management to hire more staffs or at least give them hospitability training.   We weren‚Äôt greeted with a smile. We understand that they might be a bit overwhelmed with so many check-ins. We can see that Oasia Suites is understaffed. One cleaner told us he and another colleague had to cover the whole block. He looked stressed and tired.   Another thing lacking is the cafe.   Oasia Suites has potential. We hope you guys will do something about it.
Your swimming pool is very small. And doesn't have child designated pool. U cant even control the crowd during weekends. U should have a system where guests book the slot of time to use the pool prior their check in. A lifeguard at pool will ensure that the guests follow the slot they booked. Blow the whistle when the time is up. then sanitize the area before proceed with next slot
I stayed here last weekend. Pretty last minute but I njoyed myself. My kids did not want to leave the pool. Staff was friendly and sweet. Zarul was the front desk guy that did my check in. He was informative about the surroundings of places to eat and shop. Room was clean and just nice for my family.
"very recomended ! good services , clean and the best staff very friendly & sporting ! will be repeat again.. i recoment to my friend and 2,3 friend also check in at oasia .. give 5 starr:. love u Oasia suites KL"
I frequently travel to Kl found this hotel to be a gem. The swimming pool looks welcoming but cannot swim due to MCO. Will surely come again with my kids. Cleanliness was uptodate despite the pandemic. The floors was clean and dust free. I am highly sensitive so i enjoyed my stay.
The hotel is on the hill filled with greenery. Truly refreshing. Notice their theme is wellness. They even have joga classes for guest once in a month. I was here during MCO for 1 night staycation. Hotel was quiet but it was still up to standard in terms of cleaniness. Hand sanitizer was easily available at the lobby and the lifts. Staff was friendly. I will definitely come back to try the pool. The hotel is right behind Kl Tower. Thank you Oasia for the wonderful stay.
"Nice and good location. Reception staff are very nice, polite and attentive. Rooms are big and clean. They have been recognized as Clean and Safe Certified Hotel which is great guarantee for us. Room misting and lobby sanitation are taken place. Building well taken care and maintained. Overall awesome experience. Keep it up.üòçüòçü•∞ü•∞ü§©ü§©"
"Stayed for a quick staycation with family over the new year public holiday.   Service was tip top.  From receptionists that checks me in until staff on check out day. Very attentive and courteous too.  Public area are clean,  rooms are big and super clean too.   The best part is the swimming pool.   Highly recommended"
"Been there Back to December, had a one night stay. Overall the hotel are good, cosy with the facilities provide like kitchenette and able to cook.  Enviroment are good , clean and check in service are fast during peak time.  Definitely will come back again in short time for any staycation in KL!"
"Overall is ok. Please help to maintain the hotel facility as it is. Keep up the good quality and service. Room is big and spacious. Utilities.. need to provide a clean pans and and pots. Lighting is the bathroom need to check if its working or not. Need to have dishing rack to put wet plate and glasses. The washing machine and dryer instruction too simple. Thise who nver use a dryer will get confuse. Tried 2 times using it and the dryer bot working not sure if its machine fault or human error. The tiles in the room need to be inspect, some have potentially to break and cause injury."
"My experience with deluxe room was terrible. The room was very dirty. Found hair on the bed and shower rail. Dirty mug, chair, window, and old remote controller cover. But after i changed my room to one bedroom premier, it was the contrary and i absolutely enjoyed it."
"Value for money with comfortable beds. Hotel look nicer on picture than reality. Was a little disappointe by the breakfast. Stayed in total 5 nights but removed the breakfast after 2nights, better to order grab food yourself due to the covid situation."
First come first serve for customer...it is not fair ...and if u want to buy extra parking is available how come...  This is my second time staying here but this time was so bad...access hotel room can‚Äôt open...arrange another room but the room very terrible have cockroaches and wood is mold...use almost 2 hours complete the check in
"Nice room, clean and comfy. Pool has great view of KL tower. Staffs are friendly.  Nearby to KL tower and other shops.  Walking distance to LRT or monorail station. There is a nice restaurant next to the hotel."
"Size,view,type of bed,bathroom is very unique compare to different place's. It's make me to visit more and also recommend to other people. The Front Desk Mr.Danish is very helpful and kind full. Appreciated."
My room located next to KH Tower and i cannot see any view other than next building window. Disappointed with the marketing pic they use and apparently the room is not exactly what it looks like. The cafe closed and i have to find food at the 7e KH Tower. Thumbs up for the hygienes.
-Clean hotel with friendly staff -2 bed room suite with living room and dining area -Well maintain room cleanliness  -Good environment  -Recommended those come for business trip -well done to the management
"Good view of Menara KL good location hotel was nice and close to KLCC super cheap and good deal. U can cook because they provide cooking utensil, Internet connection good. But hopefully can improve on tv signal"
"We love the service, cleanliness and overall the hotel itself. Nothing bad, overall very good experience for us. Would be good even with mco, just open the swimming pool area to enjoy the view although no swimming allowed"
"Location of the hotel is in the heart of KL, however nearest public transport is 500 meter away, overall is ok. When walking to the hotel is freezing cold. Looking at the fact that you have the feeling not welcome. Im not sure whether is due to covid or that is the norm."
Nice and peaceful place to stay. The room is super clean and very friendly staff.The environment of Oasia very peaceful and very good for release all the streets.The hotel is very good mention and very clean.
The beds were very comfy. The public pool was not crowded and had a blast of time. A very quiet experience. Had a great private time with wife. Next time would like to staf at the higher floors to appreciate the view it has to offer.
"I booked a suite for my mom‚Äôs birthday. We all gathered and celebrated her birthday there and it was quite spacious and fully equiped with utensils. The room was clean. The pool was not large but decent enough to fit in 30 people comfortably, however the view on top was beautiful as you can see the city of Kuala Lumpur."
Comfort and nice. Definitely worth the price. Will surely come back again. Swimming pool is best too clean and nice view to enjoy. The king size bed is definitely nice to sleep with to have a good sleep
"Spent one night here with my friends due to water disruption. We booked One Bedroom Premier. The room was spacious (reasonable), basic kitchen utensil provided, washer & dryer too. The room is generally clean.   However,staff who checked us in was not friendly at all. No greeting nor smile from her. Probably she's having a bad day. Tried to call guest service for mineral water, no one answered.  Approach front desk for mineral water. and waited for almost 20 mins, still haven't received. Got fed up and took it myself over the counter.    Not great, still good."
kinda dangerous to walk outside hotel at night..not near to KLCC as described can see kl tower...parkign place is bad...staff not so helpful.lift is small environment hotel next to club..not good gor family trip
Tried to check into the hotel at 6pm. Queued up for 30mins and was informed that the room is not ready. Finally checked in the hotel at 7pm. Basically paid for a half day stay. Under staffed. Sofa in the room was stained.
"5 stars experience with million dollar 270 degree view of KL skyline! Trust me, it was very spacious better than many other hotel suites (yes suites,we're not talking about the crampy deluxe rooms here) in 5 star hotels in KL, like Grand Hyatt or Majestic. Hope y'all get the point. Please take note all Covid-19 procedures were done in righfully ways here! Very good, better safe than sorry. 5 stars!"
This is my second time stay here. No regret to stay with your couples and near with KLCC. Love the arrangement in the room and friendly staff. Easy to parking and near with food stalls. I will surely repeat  when i visit kuala lumpur. Thanks! :)
"One of my favourite hotel just because their awesome staff! Thank Vinder and Ashri coz give a good service to my family. Very friendly and very helpful. Will come back later. Oh, btw hotel very nice. My kids live the swimming pool as they can see KL Tower while swimming. And you can see the KL Tower light show from you room !"
Really happy with our stay at Oasia. Perfect location and lots of space in the apartment.  Amazing view from the bathroom and very happy with bedrooms and facilities.   Only things we would reccomend are a better sofa in the living area as not very comfortable and more milk/ tea bags as we had to ask for more at reception.
The hotel is playing a dangerous game You are required to sign in to use the pool but there is noone there to enforce it. A group of 12 played in the pool running on and touching ALL of the sunbeds and chairs without leaving their names or checking temperatures. Staff did nothing to stop this from happening. Not only did it ruin my pool experience but I did not feel safe as there was no social distancing going on and no way of contact tracing.
Parking is free inside the building. So it was a plus in the middle of KL. Cleanliness needed to be upgraded.Water leaking from shower room. Need to improve the waterproof inside the shower room. Iron cable is stripped off dont know whether it is safe to use or not.
"Nice and good location. Reception staff are very nice, polite and attentive. Rooms are big and clean. Price are competative and attractive. Building well taken care and maintained. Overall awesome experiance. Keep it up."
"A top quality room, within walking distance to Pavilion and KLCC Clean and spacious room, with good staff. However, as it was still not fully operational due to Covid, I didn't get to try all the common facilities."
"As a 4 star hotel the service doesnt really up to my expectation since we need to complaint for few times in order to get a better room, even we had been given complimentary upgrades twice but the room were had too many of problems. Nevertheless the location of this hotel is a sweet spot. There is beam scooter nearby this hotel which you can pay for the service and reach KLCC within 8 mins!! Overall its an enjoyable stay and i wish you can improve the quality of your room by having a scheduled checks to avoid any problems. Thanks"
"the best place to stay , i will come again. clean n quite place to stay . recommended to all of you those want to come here. my room suite completely superb good. n thank you for the best ever this hotel."
"Terbaik all thx to sean reception manager . All credit to him should promote him to general manager instead . Should hired more local , and effecient on the parking path . Very hard to go thru the parking due to narrow path spaces"
"I had accidentally double booked a room due to computer problems. Yet I travel from Europe to stay at this hotel as it would be my second where I was happy with my first. I would have used it regularly, though this have definitely changes. So double booked room, receptionist at the counter said no worries sir, just contact Agoda whom I booked the room through and it should not be a problem sir. So after I have contacted Agoda, they come back to me and tell me that the hotel refuses to pay back for the double booked room.   Well then, great! Thank you Oasia, you never be seeing me again."
"Stayed 3 nights. Great location, spacey, nice & clean 1 bedroom suite with KL Tower view right in front of our room. Lots of restaurant located in the Hap Seng building.  Small issue was only the unfriendly night shift lady receptionist, when we asked about the wifi password and  when we checked out, the receptionist can't keep my medicine from the hospital in a fridge while waiting for a taxi even for an hour.   Overall it was a  good experience."
"My family and I stayed in Oasia 2 years ago and it was a great experience.  Because of that, we signed up to stay there recently.  Mistake!  The public area was hardly air-conditioned, certain elevators were not working, some of the shower doors were not working properly, some of the air-conditioners in the rooms were not working properly.    The staff tried their best to make our stay comfortable but limited in their ability to be successful.  Looks like management must step in.  Will not stay there anymore."
"I stayed for 4 nights and enjoyed it overall. I did see a couple of spots in my room that need maintenance - they look like water damage and I suspect there‚Äôs an issue with the pipes. Other than that, my room was great - clean & comfortable. Not much of a view as the window is so small and you can‚Äôt really get to it to look out very far. The biggest let down for me was the pool area. The pool itself is lovely, but the pool furniture isn‚Äôt great. It‚Äôs all hard plastic, there are a few loungers actually in the pool, the rest are chairs & tables. I would‚Äôve liked sun loungers around the pool to make it nicer to hang out. The location is ok - very close to the KL Tower, but not much else - plenty of transport options around and I used grab a lot which was very cheap. There was no"
"We stayed 4 nights in the Oasia Apartments in Kuala Lumpur last week. A very mixed experience: great location, roomy apartment for 4 adults, okay breakfast, lovely smiley doorman.  However, we had to ask to change rooms as there were rats making a constant scuttling and squeeking sound in the air ducts; the washing machine didn't work; the lift didn't work and we had to use the service lift throughout our stay, One night even this didn't work and we had to walk up the fire exit stairs. The air con didn't work in our bedroom, but was fixed after two calls to Reception.  However, the very worse thing (apart from the scuttling rats) was the manner of the Reception staff. They were surly, barely communicated with us and never once gave any apology for any of these issues. They"
"i have just spent 6 nights at the hotel oasia, was made very welcome on arrival. excellent room was allocated. breakfast was very good and staff helpful and attentive. shuttle service was good and driver co-operative. i hope to return. ashreeq, zarullah,al and vinder at reception very good. arrifin,zoul,khairil and razak all very helpful at assisting guests. in restaurant fekar and sharul very attentive."
"stayed here for 3 days and everyday was an experience. from the friendly staff to amazing service received, our stay went smoothly. mr azlee from the front desk also assisted us with our requests and made sure we had everything we needed. big props to the team! will consider staying here again when i‚Äôm back at kl."
"This is kind of apartment hotel located right at the end of Lorong P.Ramlee along Jalan P.Ramlee, just opposite Menara Hup Seng.  Shangri-La Hotel is within walking distance.  Life Centre is about 10 minutes walk.  GOKL shuttle bus stops just opposite Menara Hup Seng.  Check-in/out is at the ground floor.  Easy and hussle free.  Need to pay the mandatory tourism tax at RM10.  Reception service can be better.  On the other hand, the pleasant doormen were friendly and full of smiles.  We stayed at Premier room at SGD83.34 for 2 adults without breakfast.  At 11th floor, the view was nice but not spectacular.  Room is spacious and homely but a little dated.  However, it is still functional.  A hot plate stove, washing machine, huge fridge and washing basin at the living room."
"This is one great example of why I think the system of rating for accommodation properties is manipulated on trip advisor and booking.com. Booking. com gives it a 4.8 which is very good but when we arrived at the property it looked as though it needed a make over years ago. Dark and unwelcoming rooms coupled with unwelcoming staff at reception. Surly and no politeness to even acknowledge that you are there. What kind of criteria is used for these ratings? I know the location is good but that doesn‚Äôt prop the property rating up. Pool was not as glamorous as in the photos, neither was the gym. The best part of our experience there were the congenial doormen. Always with a smile and helpful. I wouldn‚Äôt go there again nor recommend it to anyone."
"Stayed in the 2-bedroom apartment and we were very pleased with how huge it was and it was very clean. The apartment had 3 TVs in total including a microwave and washing machine. Plates, pots and pans, cups and cutleries were also equipped. Reception staff were unwelcoming and cold but the doormen were always so friendly and helpful. Location is abit secluded but Grab to attractions such as Pavilion and KLCC doesn‚Äôt cost you more than RM10."
"I stayed here for 5 nights and cannot day anything negative about the hotel. The rooms were large and serviced every day so very clean. The kitchen was well appointed and I really appreciated the washer/dryer. Such a treat when travelling, particularly in a hot climate. Staff are very pleasant and helpful and will go out of their way to assist. It is within walking distance of the Twin Towers but if not inclined to walk taxis are readily available but remember to bargain if doing your own booking. The gym and pool are wonderful assets. The cafe‚Äôs breakfast buffet leaves a lot be desired.Very limited choices - hot food not hot, cereals taste stale coffee/ tea not good. So don‚Äôt pay to have breakfast included - unfortunately a waste of money."
"Stayed four nights. Comfortable mid price hotel with all the usual amenities. Good breakfasts. Restaurants about 100 m away, good choice and variety  Concierge very helpful in arranging a couple of trips and a rental car  Good value for money"
"We just stayed at the Ibis last month and had no problem being granted a late check out. When we checked into this hotel, we were told to wait and now we are not being given a late check out. Absolutely outraged and short changed!"
"Very disappointed with my recent stay here. I am not. normally one to believe in the 1 & 2 star reviews but most hit the nail on the head!   Start with the pros.   Great location, door/security Guys were always polite and it has a washing machine.   Pros, great location, door staff very polite.  Now for the cons.  Room was old and tired and no way reflected the pictures on the website. Room (1413) was dirty in a lot of places and had not been dusted in a while. Look at the pictures to see for your own eyes.   Tired decor and mould in the mastic around the shower, very dusty under the bed, on the door and the lampshade. Air con unit in room had been leaking down the wall and the plaster had bubbled up and was brown so needs repair.  The picture of the lampshade shows dust all"
"Not excited about this stay at Oasia Suites,KL. Didnt feel welcome at Front desk, staff merely did their job of checking us in. No concierge insight to help us with our lugguages upon arrival.  Upon entering the suite, probably its a corner unit, it was pitched dark upon entering. Only after we slot in the card then there was light. There were no face towel in the bathroom, 2 bath towels and a handtowel.  Front desk couldnt really help with places to recommend to us to go for makan. They only have one standard pillow which is high n uncomfortable.  Best part of the hotel was the doormen, they put a smile to us everytime we enter and leave the hotel.  Shuttle service was good as they alight us at various stops outside of hotel suites. For those who have issues walking, Oasia"
"My family and I arrived the captioned hotel at the late night on Dec 26, 2019 with very exhausted and tired condition as it took very long time to go thru the custom at the airport. The nightmare started when we arrived your hotel. The first thing your front desk told us that due to the malfunction of the evaluator, you would ""down grade"" my reservation! How ridiculous! I booked and paid for a two-bedroom but due to your own problem, you didn't offer any solution but down grade your guest! What kind of service is it?  After my serious complain to front desk, she finally agreed to offer a connected room for us. We then went to the so called connected room with your bell boy but found out that it was a joke! The room was a one bedroom only! We then needed to go back to the front"
"A very comfortably sized room with a kitchenette, washing machine and drier. Perfect stay. Close to the night attractions and everything was close by. The Free Go Kl bus stop was nearby and so was the LRT and MRT rail stations. In any case the Rides with Grab were really affordable."
"Very well located at the step of KL tower, and close proximity of many things, unit for 3 was spacious, simple, but nice with all amenities. Also possible to cook your own in the unit whilst the restaurant offers decent breakfast. Aircons were however very noisy !"
"We really enjoyed our stay at the suites, the room is quite spacious and has a lot of amenities including kitchen with fridge, and forget trouble with the laundry as it includes washing machine and detergent. The staff kind and efficient and a great location. Well recommended"
"Loved the location of the hotel, pool nice and great view from our room. Even received an upgrade. The rooms could be a little cleaner, nice washing machine and kitchen and living room space. Good shower, bed comfy. Staff lovely"
Service from Azlee and team was great as usual...we enjoyed our stay. Oasia Suites is within close proximity to a lot of areas...I enjoyed walking to KLCC and Pavilion.   Saved me time from being stuck in KL traffic jam.   The place to stay in KL!
Centrally located and has great staff. Nothing too difficult and every request is quickly looked at. Very comfortable and spacious rooms. Will repeat stay in KL at this property. There are plenty of food options very close by and the staff are very happy to help you out by loaning umbrellas.
"Stayed in this hotel/ apartment with my family for 5 days back in 2016 December, it was a random choice from booking.com and I can I say I was not  disappointed. it‚Äôs an awesome place, good hospitality, big and clean rooms, overall very welcoming . Can recommend it ."
"Family friendly perfect for group stay. Very clean with friendly staff. The downside is just that they should've provide basic amenities for kitchen such as dishwashing liquid for cleaning plates, plates wiping cloth and etc."
"This hotel was centrally located, had great facilities and a wonderful view if you get a room on a higher floor. The gym was BEAUTIFUL, one of the best I‚Äôve used in SE Asia.  Get the suite if you can, the price is very reasonable. It‚Äôs very spacious, well kept and feels like an apartment. Even includes a washer/dryer which really came in handy!  Thanks for the enjoyable stay."
"Thank you Oasia for a convenient 6-days stay at your hotel. The room is pleasantly neat and complete (iron, toiletries, hair blower, kettle, kitchen utensils, washing machine, etc.) Thank you to the receptionist for being patient with me every time I call to follow up if they received the parcel I needed for my appointments in KL. Thank you for always making sure that our toiletries are complete and that the room is clean. Will recommend to my friends!"
"It was a comfortable stay and the room was neat and clean. People at reception, restaurant were courteous. Overall stay was good. The locality was nearby the Petronas tower and it will be a great stay for tourists who want to visit Petronas Tower"
"The price of this suites far from accomodation its gave,, the rooms are spacious and well prepared, it has a good kitchen set,, beside of the minor broken pallet,, it comes with a great deal.. near to KL tower and other attraction.. best deal.."
"From the front door , reception and the bellmen the warm service given is exceptional.Room is spacious with full kitchenette.Housekeeping will clean the room daily from 9am to 6pm Zarull and Ashreeq help me at one night when i came back late to pay the taxi driver.I do appriciate them as they trusted me.Nadia always smile at counter when i approach and inquiry.Kudos to them.They always smile and make me feel welcome when approach.Terima Kasih."
"Booked this hotel for our Indian guests (Mr Anil Chitlangia X 10) through Red Apple Travel.  Location is just excellent in the center of Kuala Lumpur. You can find Indian restaurants and convenience store around. Very close to Butik Bitang - the main shopping hub of KUL.  Easy check in and check out was provided, Rooms were spacious with mini bar and tea/coffee maker. Superior rooms were booked which did not have a kitchenette as other rooms have.  Every floor has just one superior room and so each of 5 rooms were allotted in different levels.  Breakfast served was excellent with good choice for vegies.  Overall an excellent experience."
"Beautiful  clean hotel.Friendly staff,we had a beautiful  big room ,washing machine ,fridge freezer hob .Table and chairs.I would highly reccomend this hotel,within walking distance to twin towers etc .Thankyou for our pleasant stay."
Smooth check in process.  Room is clean with nice view. Location is great and taking grab car to go around is easy.  We stayed at the one bedroom suites. It would be great if there is a dressing mirror in the room. Only one mirror in the bathroom.  All staffs were helpful & friendly. Thank you to front office Vinder & Azlee for the experienced.
"Arrived very late and did not have 2 bed room available. But organized quickly. Good view gym. Washing machine is handy. Roomy. Good value. Rooftop pool is nice, just below TV tower. View from the room was the other building wall."
"We were staying here for two nights and on the 2nd night my husband became unwell after eating something at the Sentral Markets. The manager and staff were amazing helping with with taxis to the hospital, phone calls, extra room nights, wheel chair use. On one visit the manager even came with me to the hospital in case I needed some help with communication. Can't thank them all enough. Rooms were spacious and good facilities including a washing machine."
"Disappointed with the level of service in the place. The staff acted as they didn‚Äôt want our business, there was no one to help with luggage‚Äôs and the staff were all standing there just doing nothing as if it wasn‚Äôt their job. The cleanliness in the room is yet to be desired with a horrible sewage smell and mildew infested walls. Suggested something to the manager and may give this place another try to see if there is any improvement."
this hotel was super comfortable. Room was super clean and had a separate bedroom and living room area. Felt more like home in that you where not stuck in one room while there. Washing machine in room was so helpful for the trip we where on. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Breakfast in the morning was good and super convenient to have right there in the hotel
"Good hotel facilities, good location which is not hard to get food and stuffs and walking distance to KLCC; sufficient light and working space in the room for business preparation. Staff are friendly and helpful."
"Myself and the family chose this hotel on the basis of the location. We stayed 10 nights and it was an exceptional experience. The staff and ground floor workers were great and offers a very welcoming service. The hotel offers guests a free shuttle services most days which needs to be booked in advance - I thought this was handy.  As part of our package we took breakfast and I felt that what was offered was not the greatest, however it was average. They have fresh mini pastries every morning which is a delight and I very much enjoyed the cereal bar, Yummy! Location is great, nearest shopping mall - Suria KLCC walk-able distance about 10 mins away, The famous Petronas Twin Towers, very near too. Transportation is very easy to move around, the hotel staff can book cabs/taxis for"
i just stay here overnight and overall it such a pleasant stay.worth for money with spacious room. lift to car park takes quite sometimes. i stay during festive eve thus there are many tourist and quite crowded. the food serve was ok but i need to wait for the food as they need time to refill.
"This hotel is at a good location, walkable distance to the famous Twins tower and right next to the KL Tower. The room is warm and well equipped, feels just like home. Swimming pool is small but ok. Nice staff."
booking for birthday trip n surprise with spacious room at this hotel..complete with all facilities n feel like stay at own house..swimming pool very clean  with excellent view..get surprise cake from mangement n very appreciate it..will come again to oasia hotel..
1. it is  apartment hotel and and its more than apartment cause its a suite 2. you got your own kitchen and yiur own washing machine. just put the dirty clothes and it clean alao dryung for you 3. its in proxumately distanve from city center. 4. its good
"This is an amazing property.  It is quiet, clean and well appointed.  The staff was very attentive and professional.  Priced reasonably and in a great location.  We walked to restaurants nearby and explored parks and enjoyed all the green space in the center of the city.  Taxis were easily used to visit other areas of the city."
"Booked the 2 bedroom suite for 2 nights. It was big and spacious. However, there are no nice views. We were just facing a run down building opposite us. But it didnt matter, since we were mostly out and kept the curtains closed.  The rooms were relatively clean. This place is located at the end of the street, slightly uphill. But we mostly took grab everywhere. It cost about RM6-14 to get around. If you are taking grab from KLIA, it's about RM75. We had a pleasant stay."
"Nice location, Very kind & fast staff and comfortable facility  If you want to meet very fast service hotel, you must choose this hotel.  In my experience, the staff was very skillful and they were working with sincerity in their hearts."
"We have splendid stay in this Suites as we celebrate my wife birthday and our 24th wedding anniversary. We arrived on 29th August and check-in about 11pm due to flight delay. The moment we entered we were greeted with an excellent warm welcome by the security at the entrance and the front desk staff. The check-in process was done in a min as we have already booked and paid fully thru AirAsiaGo. We stayed in room 2107. We enjoyed our 4 nights stay, the chambermaid cleaned our room and made the bed daily, top-up the coffee and tea. And the swimming pool and shower rooms are well maintain. We love this place. We stayed in this Suites last year 30th Aug 2018. And we will come back again. Thank you."
"It takes about 10 minutes to get to the hotel by the station.Near Kuala Lumpur Tower. The hotel is well equipped and the rooms are neat and tidy. Every employee is polite and will answer our questions carefully Overall, I should be very good at all aspects of this hotel."
"I took my family for a weekend staycation in KL, chose this hotels out of many others, and everything was excellent. The room was spacious, and for the price it certainly went over my expectations. Located in the KL, Golden Triangle, it took us merely around 10 mins to walk to any of the tourist hotspots, with KL Tower being the closest. Wonderful view from the room as well."
"Loved how clean the rooms were. Bed and pillows were comfy. Didn't try the breakfast or the gym either. But the swimming pool was nice. I love how the location easily accessible but at the same time not crowded. The price is very reasonable, I would definitely recommend this hotel."
