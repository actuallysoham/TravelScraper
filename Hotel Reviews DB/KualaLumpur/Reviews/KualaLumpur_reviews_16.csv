"As always, superb service and facilities. There is a new tenant restaurant by the pool with good food for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Big pool and private.  Rooms are always fresh and clean with functioning equipments."
"1. Stay location perfect, near to KLCC 2. Hotel manager Mike and his team is so cooperative and friendly 3. The view from apartment is so soothing and relaxing 4. Lanson staff is so much supportive and whatever your queries and issuues are they respond and resolve quickly. 5. Lanson place is an example of what should be serviced apartment look like and have. You name it, they have facilities 6. Definitely recommend"
"We have spent a good 6 months staying here and it felt more like a home than a service residences.  The biggest impression Lanson made on us was at every touch point from the security personnel all the way to the sales & front of house. We never felt that we were mass market. Rather, it feels like the Private Banking of the hospitality industry where all the staff are friendly & pay attention to details. Yes, they may not be perfect but they try the best that they can within their means.  From the moment we stepped in, our personnel effects were waiting for us in the apartment along with all our prior requests. It’s the sort of feeling u get when u arrive home instead of waiting to check in and shuffling through paperwork.   Amenities wise, they provide all the basics & more."
Easy and fast check in process. Super huge 3 bedrooms apartment and very clean. Strategic location and Grab Food friendly. Beautiful city view and friendly staff. Definitely we will come back again soon.
The apartment are very well maintained & clean. All equipment also in the room are complete easily can used. The staff very friendly and polite. Love it very much. Definitely will come back again very soon!!
"""The apartments are very clean fully furnished. The beds are extremely comfy and the pillows are great. staff are extremely friendly. WIFI signal is good. Amazing pool. For sure I'll come back again.."
"The team is friendly and very helpful, making you feel welcomed. Rooms are clean, spacious living area and very comfy bed. Walking distance to many eating places and places of interest. Choose to walk instead of driving, to see more"
"We spent 3d 2n at Lanson Place over the last weekend. We booked a 3 rooms unit. It is a perfect place for a weekend getaway and we enjoyed very much. The unit is very spacious.  They did what the claimed ""Make Yourself At Home"". It's better than home to be exact!  The management and staff are nice, helpful and courteous, especially to the Resident Manager Mr Mike for his hospitality.  We will definitely be coming back agin!"
Lanson Place....a perfect staycation! Stayed for a night and really love the unit. We booked for 2bedrooms and its facing the pool and twin towers! The lounge at the rooftop is stunning with spiral staircase to outdoor garden. We walked down the street and spoilt by choices of cuisine at changkat bukit bintaang. Security is strict here and staffs are friendly.
"We celebrated our 22nd wedding anniversary with a staycation and it was more than what we expected. Some things could have been better at check in, more informative about how things work in the apartment or at least the correct way to log onto the wifi. I put it down to new staff.  But we figured it out with the general instructions on the website anyway.   The apartment is clean and well designed and functional, everything worked well- top notch kitchen appliances- and the views were amazing on the 18th floor. I loved the toiletries too. The bed was super comfy and we fell asleep to an incredible subwoofed playlist with the KL Tower lights winking at us.   Facilities were great, no complaints.   Breakfast was good - it was served in-room due to the MCO and could have been"
"I came to Malaysia for work and Lanson Place was my temporary home until I found an apartment closest to work. They were so helpful from day one, especially considering I travelled in the middle of the pandemic and there were so many restrictions in place. They were accommodating, they made sure I had everything I needed at all times and there was always someone to help me out.  The pool was closed at first due to the pandemic, but they opened halfway through my stay and I was able to enjoy it, as well as the great cafe they have by the pool, which offers great options for food and drinks.  They were also kind enough to allow my cat to stay with me, and even arranged to help with my move to my new apartment. I have only good things to say about the entire month I soent there,"
"Chosen this hotel or service apartment as heard lots of good feedback from friends. Indeed never disappoint me!  The bedroom is facing the KL Tower, so relaxed seeing the colourful towers blinking at night while laying on the huge comfort bed.     Due to MCO, the breakfast is limited as they served us eggs, salad, hotdog and ham on a plate; fruits in a take away cup. However, you may request for other  stuffs eg cheese, danish and others. Cereals, juices and coffee are free flow. The view from the lounge was spectacular!     You wont get hungry here, you can even cook in the room as the kitchen has all equipment from pan, plates, fork, spoon…even equipped with dish washer.  We walked to the bar street down the street…chankat bukit bintaang. Lots of choices here and further down"
"I stayed in Lanson Place for around 8 months, was on a work assignment. I was in a one-bedroom apartment. It comes with a fully equipped kitchen, having an oven and dishwasher, a laundry area with washer and dryer. You think of an appliance and you will find it in your apartment.   The lounge room has a comfortable sofa, surround sound speakers, TV with Bluetooth connectivity, can use laptop, mobile phone to play movies/ music or other shows. The view of the KL Tower and Petronas Towers from the lounge is very nice.   Bedroom, kitchen, bathroom were well designed and spaces. The bed was very comfortable. The kitchen has an island as a dining table. The bathroom is luxurious with wardrobes.  There is a huge swimming pool and shared rooftop space with gym, pool table and"
"I stayed here for 2 months on a work assignment at the end of 2020. I had already been living in KL for 8 months and moving to Lanson Place was the first time I really felt at home in KL. I was in a one-bedroom apartment with a full kitchen - it was really nice to have an oven and dishwasher.  The bedroom was large but the study was not conducive to working from home as the desk and chair was a bit uncomfortable. Luckily the kitchen has a massive island bench that doubles as a dining table that I could fit 6 people around and then during the day it was a great office space.  The lounge room has a comfortable L shaped sofa, rug and coffee table and has a really nice cosy feel with a great view of the KL Tower and Petronas Towers. The tv had bluetooth installed so I was able to"
I stayed at Lanson Place at bukit ceylon for around 8 months in total . This place gives a really nice experience with all the necessary facilities in apartment with alot of place and comfort. You can even cook your own food . Place has all required utensils to cook. Buffet breakfast is really healthy and tasty . I would say you can expect a little bit of variety in breakfast menu which I found to be repeat ed. But a must visit place.
"We stayed with Landon Place for over a month as a family of 5. Rooms were very comfortable and nicely designed to your use and staffs were ever so friendly and very helpful. The location was excellent too as in 2-5mins walk there were pop restaurants, massage spas and Pavillion! We would definitely stay at Lanson again!!"
"My family was gather at new year, we pick this serviced apartment due to we want to cook ourself.  The apartment provide fully equiped kitchen, we can enjoy our cooking. The pool is hige and the kids pool is very interesting, there's a cafe at poolside provide good foods.  The staff are very friendly and our family members enjoyed the stay so much, we will be stay at this oproperty whever we are in KL."
"stayed for a weekend for Staycation after the facilities re-open.  The suite is spacious and clean, the pool is huge wwith kids pool, my family enjoyed so much.  The breakfast lounge at rooftop with stunning view, we only enjoy one morning as KL has so many good local foods, we went to Pudu for local breakfast where is very close,  The friendly are very friendly and welcoming from security to Housekeeping.  Highly recommended."
"We have spent 2 months at Lanson place, and this serviced residence is excellent (obviously otherwise we would have changed). We were there during the CMCO period and despite that the services were excellent and the breakfast was good. It was still served as usual following the SOP. The apartment, a 2-bedroom with a study room, was spacious and well decorated. The king size bed was very comfortable and they have a different selection of pillows to make sure you spend a good night. It comes with a fully equiped kitchen, a laundry area with washer and dryer. The staff is amazing, special thanks to Mike the resident manager and Ali from the housekeeping team. Everything is made to make you feel home.  Too bad that some units are loosing their view on the Petronas towers because of"
"We have been staying at the Lanson with 2 teenagers for about 5 weeks and had a very nice experience. The furnished apartment is very spacious, nicely decorated, not too personal not too standard. Kitchen very convenient and well equipped with washer&dryer. Staff was extremely kind and helpful, the whole family could find space for Virtual Schooling and Home Office. Really nice and comfortable lounge with rooftop and 360 view. The only inconvenience was the background noise of the city but this is probably the case in KLCC with many construction sites all around. We also enjoyed the many very good restaurants within walking distance.  Greetings to all Lanson staff and we will definitely come back."
"Stayed here on a business trip for 3 months. It was an amazing experience. Rooms are well organized with all the basic amenities and super spacious. Our room includes, one kitchen, one living area and one bedroom. Staff is courteous and helpful. On our anniversary, Mike helped me set up a surprise for my spouse. KL tower is visible from my window. I highly recommend Lanson Place for family vacation as well."
excellent 3C [Convenient-Comfortable-Clean] stay in lanson place bukit ceylon  excellent 3C [Convenient-Comfortable-Clean]  Merry Christmas to all in lanson place thank you for the great hospitality   happy new year
"As a family of 4, we were looking for a comfortable transition from quarantine before settling into our house in KL. I recommend the Lanson Place as it is very clean, modern, decorated with style for any stay of a few weeks or more. The location is great, close to many restaurants. I can recommend la Botega Mediteranea, Pisco and Palillos in walking distance. when we stayed, the pool was closed but looked good. The apartments are big, well serviced. Staff is kind and friendly. Having studied the other service apartments, I think this one is the best in town."
"We stayed at the one bedroom suite with twin tower view, the room is homey design with fully equipped kitchen, we cooked our own meal and very enjoy home cooking in a serviced apartment.  The location closed to Jalan alor where you can enjoy all the local foods, also pretty close to Klcc.  Staff are very helpful from security to housekeeping . Highly recommend to family travel."
"we come to KL to visit our family, we picked the serviced apartment, the unit is spacious and clean, staff are very friendly and welcoming, the lounge at rooftop have a stunning view, the pool at 5th floor is huge,my kids enjoy so much. highly recomnended to family or business travel."
"We needed a location where to spent few weeks. After 2 choices we eventually find Lanson Place and I have to say is the best choice if you look for an apart-hotel. The location is great: 5 minutes drive to top malls, 10 minutes from KLCC Park if you prefer morning runs, plenty of eating choices around and all these without having the noisy feeling where you stay too centrally.  The price is also fair for what you get. The facilities are also good: swimming pool is big, gym is fairly equipped and the lounge at the 48th floor with a fabulous view over KL city center has a pool table, a big TV, computers and a nice seating area. The breakfast is tasty and with enough variety at the same 48th floor, which means you can enjoy your food with a great panoramic view. The staff is very"
"The two bedroom is very spacious and spotless, the gym at rooftop is very nice view, the breakfast lounge which you can't miss. Location is very close to changkat where all the bars and restaurants are around, walking distance to pavilion mall where has plenty of restaurant and shops.  Highly recommend to family or business traveller."
"The hotel is located in a quiet area within the City Centre. Most of the staff we encountered during our stay was very helpful and the friendly environment made us feel at home. The room was spacious and clean, and if you ever have a chance, do visit the Club Lounge on top floor to enjoy the breathtaking view."
"The rooms and views are class apart. Moreover, The courteous behaviour of staff is definitely a foreigner needs, when in Kuala Lumpur. It is perfect getaway for vacation with family. Do ask for Mike, for any assistance."
Clean room and complete room with kitchenware for simple cooking. Convenient place as near to changkat which have all the accessories for food and pubs. Staffs were friendly and helpful. The view from the lounge is fantastic.
a place you will feel like home.  you find everything that u need. almost everything complete in room.  good and friendly service....  and highly recommend for 42th floor lounge. awesome and superd view of Kuala Lumpur.    a place you will never regret for short stay or long stay
"We booked a unit on the 18th floor and was very happy with the space that we got. Staff were very polite and helpful too. But the highlight for our stay was the lounge on 48th floor, as we got 180 degrees view of KL. Awesome and unforgettable view."
"Runaway from our usual hub and enjoy our Staycation with friends. The landing experience is great. Even the car parking area in the basement is well maintained. The hotel lobby is so calm and feels like coming home. The room is fully equipped with a kitchenette. The setting allows us to do some light cooking and pot luck as we didn't get to dine out. The experience of pot-luck..ing in the hotel room was so fun! We get to dine in at our own comfort without compromising SOP, the luxury of space keeps our distance safe from unknown strangers."
"I was staying 2,5 years at Lanson Place Bukit Ceylon. And it became my home far away from home. The team, from the guards to cleaning staff, front desk and management do an excellent job. I came as a guest and it soon felt like being part of a family.   The apartments are warm and welcoming. Very well maintained. Excellent appliances and cookware. Very clean, spacious, and modern. Beautiful view of Petronas Towers and Menara Tower.   In close proximity toKLCC, Pavillion and multiple very nice restaurants of different cuisines.   I always have and I always will recommend Lanson Place to everyone going to Kuala Lumpur. No matter if long or short stay. Whenever I will return to Kuala Lumpur, Lanson Place will be my place to be."
"Was in KL for project work from Feb to Oct 2020 this year. Assigned apartment was great and equipped with washing machine, dishwasher, microwave and oven, on top of usual kitchen items, to provide a kind of 'home' stay and not forgetting the daily housekeeping offered. Layout is simple and great for family staycation or long term stay. The compound offered a kind of serenity and peaceful environment based on the location. It's about 10 mins walk from this place to The Pavilion and this works well for me as it's the kind of exercise I needed daily. Overall, my personal opinion is a should try for a stay and personal preference will be return to stay when I'm next back to KL for work or family staycation."
"We had a unit with 3 bedrooms on level 37 with an amazing view. The unit was equipped with kitchenette and utensils. It is so much convenient for me especially having a 2yo kid tagging along.  This is a highly recommended place for family and friends get together. The unit is so spacious and comfortable. Wish it was my own house. The service staff were very accommodative and helpful. Knowing that I have a 2yo kid, they have prepared a babycot in the room without me reminding. 5/5 service"
Lovely attentive staff right up to the security guards. Spotlessly clean and quiet for a relaxing short getaway. Been here so many times and they never disappoint. Thank you once again to each and everyone of you.
"Myself and my family attend a wedding in KL, so we book 2 two bedroom suite, the suite with twin tower view, spacious and clean.  Staff are very friendly and helpful, the pool is huge and my family enjoy so much.  Location is close to city centre but quite, highly recommended to family and honeymoon trip."
"we stayed at Lanson Place for family staycation, the suite is spacious and spotless.  location close to Pavillion & KLCC, lots of restaurant and bars within walking distance.  Staff are very friendly and helpful, they recommend us to the local breakfasts area which is delicious. Highly recommended to business or leisure."
"Had a weekend get away in this hotel. The security guard at the entrance recorded our temperature, then we were check-in by a friendly staff at the reception. We booked a single bedroom and was given a higher floor. The room was clean, spacious and well-maintained. The pillow was too soft to my liking but I like that the a/con was cold! We also enjoyed that we can take a stroll to Changkat, had our dinner with some drinks and went back to our room safely without worrying about driving. We were also invited for breakfast at the lounge on Level 48. The view was amazing with the KL tower right in front of us and we could also partially see the Petronas Twin Tower. Breakfast was simple which was just good enough for me. Staff was also friendly and was seen wearing their mask too,"
"it was a wonderful weekend gateway to celebrate my birthday ,love the room ,spacious and clean ,staff was friendly and helpful,love the klcc view from the room ,we will definitely stay there again.Great experience !"
"My family and I spent 1.5 months at Lanson Place Bukit Ceylon, the staffs were very accommodating and welcoming, especially during our self quarantine period (tight control with care). To my surprise, there was a birthday cake delivered to the unit fridge on my birthday. It was a homemade burnt cheesecake from the Resident Manager. The staffs can remember your name by heart and addressed everyone at the breakfast floor. Overall, very good experience!"
"Thank you so much Residence Manager Mr.mike chan for the birthday arrangement. The burn cheese cake superb. The room , due to this covid pandemic, the cleanliness of the room was super good . You don’t have to worry about the hygiene. Location was near to the city and Jln alor . So you can easily find food during day and night . Housekeeping doing very well , make me feel safe to stay with them . Thank you . I definitely will come back again . Thank you ."
"Did a company meeitng at Lanson Place Bukit Ceylon Serviced Residence in August 2020 recently and it was a last minute booking. All happened smoothly with the great help by Mr Mike and his team on the bookings of the room, meetings setup, breakfast,lunch and dinner from day 1 to day 3. Been provided such a great room , great service and also a very warm welcome by the whole team. All of the participants that attended the meeting was very very happy and satistfied. the most important is that all of the bosses and top management was really happy and comfortable with the service and the rooms. Well done and keep it up. Surely will repeat our stay!"
Had a great bonding family time in Lanson Place. Great serenity with lots of parking space..free of charge :). Will definitely recommend this place for staycation. Fully equipped kitchenette...hence could cooked. Friendly staff too..a family oriented place.
Enjoyed a good holiday stay at Lanson Place KL. Nice place and clean with excellent view and great service. Good restaurants and big malls nearby the area. Good family bonding and truly enjoyed the stay. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.
Staffs were attentive and friendly. Great location as it is located in the heart of KL. Room was cosy and spacious with a great view as well. A perfect place to stay with family and friends. Highly recommend!
"I stayed in Lanson Place Bukit Ceylon for just over a year, from 1st August 2019 till 10th August 2020. It is an amazing place to stay, and I have a lot of fresh, fund memories because I only just left Malaysia this August. The facilities are awesome, I’ll miss the gym and the pool. The apartments are large, spacious and well finished with nice furniture and appliances. The view is amazing! Large windows give you a very wide view of the city, yet the windows do open just enough to get in some air from outside if you wish. You would hardly get any apartment as large as the apartments in this property. It is located in a very very quiet and nice place, quiet, yet very close to the bubbly Changkat, Bukit Bintang and the city centre - KLCC areas. Shall I talk of  the staff there?"
"I ended up staying here for 6 months, firstly through COVID alone and then with my family joining me. All along the way I found the LP team to be incredibly thoughtful and courteous. The facilities are everything you could need for long term stay and in comfort. Would not hesitate to recommend to anyone. Top notch."
"The building has a relaxing design with water and greeneries welcoming you at the entrance, the pool area, and roof deck. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. I had a medical emergency and they readily supported my needs. The unit is also good modern design which maximized the space available. I will definitely return in my next visit."
"This is my second time staying at Lanson Place, and I must say that the quality of service here never fails to disappoint. From the security staff, to the receptionist, to the cleaning crew - I was well taken care of from the moment I arrived, to the moment I left. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a serviced apartment, or a quick weekend staycation in Kuala Lumpur."
"I stayed at Lanson Place for almost one year and spent the whole lockdown there - I think it's the best condo in KL for long stay guests. The apartments are light and spacious and the finishing quality and furniture is very high by a Japanese company. The view over KL is one of the best, and the location is great, close to many bars, restaurants, cafes and the shopping district. The staff make the experience so comfortable, this place really feels like a home. I'll definitely come back even for just weekend trips at Lanson. Would recommend to both business and leisure travellers!"
"A beautiful well designed serviced apartment .If you want a beautiful place to stay with all luxuries and even wants to cook on your own..then this is the place you should stay.. whatever you would need to live a smooth and Hassel free ,you will get all those things in this serviced residency. I spent 3months in Kuala Lumpur because of lockdown. And if i will ever want to come to kuala lumpur again it would be because of only one reason that if I would get a stay in Lanson place serviced residency."
"I have Been In KL many time the last 15 years. It was my first time to stay on these hotel and it will be my hotel in all future trips to KL. All staff was excellent, yo have a feeling of one big family. There is no restaurant but just 200 m away you will find everything, some of the best restaurants to the very famous street with all the street kitchens, Also many bars is just 300 meters away, everything from whiskey bar, wine bar to more normal bars. Walking distance to one of the mist farmers shopping malls, walking distance to KLCC. The hotel is located in a quiet are comparing to many otter hotels. The hotel is for short and long stay. (Service apartment) 100% I will be back on same hotel on my next visit"
"Even though we were unable to enjoy most of the facilities provided for by Lanson Place due to covid19, we had a memorable eid mubarak holiday here. The location is great and the room are large and comfortable"
"Lanson Place is a 5 minutes drive from Petaling Street markets, and tucked in a quiet neighborhood. Reception area is cosy, and they have a huge pool  Room is spacious and clean. Good for family who plans to stay for a few days or to do some simple cooking.  Security officers at the entrance, car park and lobby are very friendly, vigilant, and professional."
"Lanson Place is incredibly comfortable and hospitable, without being stuffy or uptight like some ""luxury"" hotels. The room layout is very smart and inviting, the facilities are first-rate and the location is outstanding. Most of all the staff is very friendly and helpful and really makes you feel at home. This was a short stay for me (only 2 nights) but previously I have stayed at Lanson Place for several weeks at a time and it was just as good or better."
"It felt like a short escape from the ordinary. Everything in the hotel exude elegance and exclusivity. Overall, it was a surprisingly delightful experience. The service was top of the notch and the hotel staff were super friendly. I would love to go back there again, someday, when things have calmed down. Be safe everyone!"
"This beautiful ""home"" is situated a stone's throw from the hustle and bustle of Kuala Lumpur, 5 minutes from all the happening eateries, pubs, mini markets and the train service.  Yet, the minute you arrive at the forecourt, there is a sense of calm and welcome.  The apartment is tastefully appointed.  The stunning lounge on the 48th floor has spectacular views of the city.  Every single member of staff, from reception to housekeeping to security guards, delivers exceptiional personal service they can be very proud of.  This is the only place we will stay in this city."
"Best out of home experience, and I travel frequently all over the world. Excellent appliances and cookware. Very clean, spacious, and modern. Beautiful view of Petronas Towers and Menara Tower. In close proximity to Lulu's supermarket, KLCC (conference center) and attached Pavillion mall, and kiddy-corner to Fahrenheit mall, as well as Sungei Wang Plaza. Multiple Starbucks locations and restaurants every step of the way.  Staff are very courteous and flexible, especially for those requiring their room cleaned outside of regular hours. When in KL again, I will definitely choose Lanson Suites for a home away from home."
Its stunning. Was on floor 18. High end modern finishes. Electric blind for the main bedroom. Beautiful bathroom with Hans Grohe fixtures. Clean place. Service was great. Complimentary shuttle service to places around KL also amazing and on time. Special thanks to Gautham and John who felt like family at the end of my trip.  One small niggle was my request for a high floor apartment and despite me checking up daily this was not fulfilled. Was disappointed when new guests to the hotel arrived and were given floor 41 :( and not long term guests ... Hopefully on my next visit i will get a high floor apartment
"I booked a one-bedroom apartment; it was huge, modern, super clean, very quiet and the view from both the living room and the bedroom was amazing. Air conditioning and wifi worked well. I appreciated the coffee machine and the laundry facilities inside the apartment. The front desk staff and concierge were friendly, helpful and very service minded. Lanson Place offers excellent value for money. Next time in KL I will stay there again."
Staff made us feel completely comfortable and welcome from the moment we entered the hotel. They all interacted with me.We had a very enjoyable and memorable stay. I'd most definitely stay at this hotel again.
"A good location which near night market, Bar and Pavilion. All the staffs at breakfast are helpful, welcoming and friendly, specially Christy. Rooms are spacious which include dinning area, kitchen and washing facilities. We picked 3 bedrooms suite, we had a lot of space for us. Gym facilities are well equipped. Pool located 4th floor is amazing, is standard 50 meter... Cool. We almost spend a half day at there, we did enjoy the moment in Malaysia with local food and different cuisine food. The weather is hot but is fine for us and peoples are very friendly, Lanson Place is my first choice in Kuala Lumpur will be back any time in future."
"3rd time staying at Lanson. Always feel at home in Kuala Lumpur when I stay here Centrally located, but in a quiet section of the city. Amenities within the room are exceptional quality.   Staff are on hand to assist, but not overbearing. Very pleasant and proffessional."
"A wonderful getaway stay in Lanson Place. Love the location where it is not far from the city while remains in a quiet neighborhood, away from the hetic traffic CBD. Apartments are spacious and comfortable, perfect settings for families. Cozy breakfast arrangement with an opened view of the city. We will definitely be back!"
"Hi guys,   at first-what a perfect stay! We are still so happy.   My boyfriend and I left the 2nd. of march to 6. the march in the beautiful Lanson Place Hotel. We had a apartment at the 46. floor. Whoa, that was a view! From our room we could see the big Kuala Lumpur Tower, which filled our hotel room every evening with the light animations. With this view (and that even from our bed in the bedroom) we enjoyed every single second in our room. Bedroom, living room and kitchen are equipped with large windows. A very lightly apartment. What super practical was, that the apartment is not only very big and spacious, but also the apartment is very well equipped. In the room there is a washing machine and a dryer with iron and ironing board (which was very convenient for us, as we are"
"I've frequently stayed at Lanson Place over the past 3 years, and I've always enjoyed my stays. The staff are very helpful and the rooms (mini apartments) are large and well-equipped. You can easily stay there for a week or more and feel at home. The location is also very convenient, within walking distance of the older business area of KL city centre, and just a few minutes from the bars and nightlife of Bukit Bintang."
"The Residence is absolutely brilliant! The residence manager Mike Chan is very friendly, helpful and sympathetic. We had four days the one bedroom residence and it was very nice! The room is very big and have an amazing view over the city. It is near the KL Tower and the twin towers, a must see! The hotel have a free shuttle service to the KLC (twin towers) that is a plus.  Good free facilities like a big pool, a fully equipped gym and billiard. The breakfast is in the 48th floor with a nice view over the city and very good as well, many variations and you have everything what you need.  I will definitely come back again! I love this place and give 5/5 stars."
"we spent over 3 weeks in Malaysia and luckily that we pick this service apartment for my last stop.  The apartment is spacious with full kitchen facilities, washer/dryer etc.  Although it is not located in KLCC, but it is easy assess to city centre.  They did a good job to maintain the common area hygiene, the lounge at roof top is a must to visit.  Highly recommended"
"I stay at Lanson Place over a week with my family, the apartment is so spacious and spotless, the club house have kids pool and huge pool.  My kids can run around inside the apartment and we cook dinner for few nights.  Staff are always friendly and helpful, the security is 24 hours made me feel very safe.  I will definitely return to Lanson place whenever I back to KL."
"Lanson Place never fails to surprise me, this is my 4th stay and still truly is wonderful. For those avid travellers you will agree with me that nothing beats a personalised service especially when you’re away from home. There’s no shortage of that at Lanson Place and in fact that’s what they do best apart from the 5 Star standard of cleanliness. Thank you Lanson team for looking after me as always, see you again soon!"
"Lanson Place Bukit Ceylon has been home to my project team members and short stay business travellers for over 2 years now. Not only is the location, views, décor and facilities amazing, but above all, management and staff have gone out of their way to make us all feel at home. From hosting surprise birthday, Christmas and special event parties to arranging outdoor gatherings the team has made Lanson Place a home away from home for us team of expats. I would happily recommend Lanson Place Bukit Ceylon to anyone travelling to Kuala Lumpur."
"We were upgraded when we checked in (bonus!). Very large suite, super clean. We were on the 26th floor and had a view out to the Sky Tower and Petronas Towers (see photos of view). Wonderful Breakfast selection and it is on the 46th floor with amazing views of the city (don't skip breakfast!!) Very friendly staff! Super comfortable bed!"
"Clean, love the decor in the room. Breakfast area absolutely breathtaking, and the food served was delicious. Front desk and security are friendly and will not hesitate to lend a helping hand when there is a need."
"Great large apartments with massive rooms and views over the city. Very friendly staff, breakfast is ok, nothing special, but you have facilities in your rooms to prepare food. Only negative is the lifts have key cards that only operate the lift to your floor and the bar, so if you have a colleague in another floor, you cant get to their apartment, which was irritating, but not a big deal."
"You really are spoilt in terms of amenities and size of apartment, but for me the real icing on the cake was the breakfast room on the top floor. Staff up there were excellent. The only downside is the temperature of the pool, which is enormous. Was somewhat chilly. I would definitely stay here again."
"when i book this hotel, I don't expect such nice property due to the rate is not expensive.  When I arrive, the security help me to load the luggage, due to heavy rain, another staff hold the umbrella for me.  The room is spacious and clean, great twin tower view, much better than traditional 5 star hotel, althrough the facilities can't compare, the location is so convenience, many restaurant around within 3 min walk. Staff are so helpful."
"Very good location to go eating around bukit bingtang, china town, pavilion and so on. But need more effort for room keeping. I experienced no face towel, hand towel, bath mat and so on. More delta is no drink service at the lounge, you need to pay just a cup of coffee, but plus is good cafe and convenience store at the pool side. Especially coffee and cake at the cafe is excellent!"
"the hotel is located in residential area, quite but easy access to pavillion and KLCC, walking distance to changkat and Jalan alor where all the bars and restaurants are located. The apartment is clean and spacious, full kitchen facilities, washer and dryer are available in all units.  The roof top breakfast lounge is perfect, the view is stunning, staff are very helpful and cheerful, highly recommended."
"I really enjoyed my stay at Lanson Place. Cleanliness is something that I always look out for when I book a place to stay and Lanson Place has been great in that aspect. They had everything I needed. The bed was really comfortable too, I slept really well throughout the night. The location was perfect, it was quiet but also near to the key areas in KL. The service staff were really helpful and polite, checking in and out was fast and easy. I would highly recommend anyone who comes to KL to stay here."
"the property is excellent, spacious, spotless, full kitchen facilities, washer & dryer etc. The huge size pool at 5th floor is great, my kids enjoy so much.  Staff are helpful and cheerful...highly recommended"
My home when I’m in KL Very nice place and good location All employees focused on customer satisfaction  Room and confort are excellent   The view from 48 th floor is so nice : taking breakfirst  here give you serenity for the day
"Modern styled apartment.Cosy and super clean. The staff are very welcoming. From the security guard to reception counter and everyone was super friendly and helpful. The staff are the reason that we would return and recommend this place to others. Full functioning unit with kitchen utensils, cutleries, coffee maker, washing machine, dryer and dishwasher."
"the hotel is quite and peaceful, located in residential area but easy access to pavillion, jalan alor and KLCC.  the design is very homey and spacious, apartment is clean, and the view is stunning, many bar and restaurant around, huge pool with cafe, the breakfast is superb."
"The appartments are just stunning, clean, and the views are breathtaking. The service of the place is the best you can get and the location is just perfect to enjoy Kuala Lumpur. Everything is walking distance and there are many restaurants and food options nearby the hotel. Fashionistas and shopping addicts will be delighted too, as the most amazing shopping malls are a few minutes away by feet. Breakfast lounge is beautiful and their fitness center is super well equipied with new machines. Would definitely come back if i had to visit KL again."
"My family stayed at a two bedroom residence in Lanson Place for three nights in December, 2019 and it was a great choice.  It's centrally located and walking distance to Jalan Alor for wonderful food.  We had a nice view including the Petronas Towers and the two floor lounge at the top of the building was an added bonus.  It has all around views of the city from about 45 stories up so we didn't feel like we had to go to the viewing areas of KL Tower or the Petronas Towers for terrific views of the city.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  Highly recommended!"
"Initially I gave this 3 stars at start of stay.  I’ve now reduced it to 1 star at the end of the stay and wouldn’t stay here again.   It’s a very high rise building. We stayed on floor 43.  It’s a lovely apartment.  However, we never got a good night sleep for the whole duration of our stay.  There was a loud persistently annoying continuous noise all night every night!!    We couldn’t work out where it was coming from.   But it seemed to come from within their own building system (either the vents, air conditioning system or something else).  Based on sleep deprivation I can’t give it more than 1 star.  And therefore would not stay here again.    The cleaning staff were wonderful. You should always tip them daily.  They do a good job and workers should be tipped (in my view)."
Lanson place always give me the feeling is welcome me back home. The staff always care about you and your feeling and how your stay.  The manager Mike Chan are friendly and welcome me this make me feel like going back my own home stay I will give him 👍🏻
"Our family decided to have a return stay in Lanson Place during the recent holidays due to their wonderful hospitality and spacious apartment. With its well-equipped utensils and tools, you can cook in the kitchen anytime. It makes you feel at home."
"As usual, whenever I go to KL, I will choose Lanson Place Bukit Ceylon Serviced Residences. Everything you need at home, it's just there. You feel home and you feel small because of its huge space and amenities such as the Pool and Gym. Far from town but I love it because it is away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Food? No problem. Food deliveries are just few buttons away and there nearby restaurants that you could visit too."
Very comfortable stay with great hospitality from the hotel crews. The location is good and very accessible to most places of interest. Definitely will come back again! Special thanks to the resident manager for providing great arrangements to make the stay even more memorable!
"We booked a 1 bed apartment through Agoda for 1 night.  There was an enormous amount of space.  A fully equipped kitchen.  Spacious living area with large TV and a spacious bedroom with mountains of storage space.  I've lived in much smaller flats.  The building is slightly showing its age but nothing too much worry about.  The 50 meter pool on the 5th floor was also huge. Very pleasant and stylish lounge area on the top floor complete with iMac computers and a pool table.  All the staff were super polite.  Downsides were the under equipped gym (no rowing machine, only a few light weights), the lifts often take an age to arrive and the a/c was slightly noisy but over all fantastic value especially if you like more space."
"althrough the property not located in KLCC, it’s quite and easy access to the city.  cozy lobby and homey apartment design.  The size very spacious, it’s a one bedroom suite but hotel room price, great value.  The staff is nice and welcoming, always prepared to help."
"the property localted close to KLCC & Pavillion, walking distance to Jalan Alor the famous local food street.  The aprtment is huge and clean, well maintained.  The view at lounge is stunning and the pool at 5th floor is fantasic.  The staff are always friendly and helpful.  Will definately stay here again when I return to KL."
I would recommend lanson if you are looking for a long stay. All the business centres are quite near. The room is quite spacious and not claustrophobic. Most of the amenities are at par with hotels.The staff goes out of the way to help you out.
Excellent luxurious apartment rooms with first rate facilities and staff and service very helpful with any requests. Recommend this location in KL. Hot water didn't work in one bathroom but fixed promptly. Kids allowed on scooters by pool which isn't great for users. Great for teenagers/parents.
"The best place i stayed so far ( regardless of which country ) and the only place i would stay when i travel to KL. The services, location, cleaniness is superb! Suitable for family stay! Never once disappoint me."
Spacious room with good interior design touch with bright color. The hotel is in good location and near to pub street. Convenient store and poolside cafe at level 5. My family had a enjoyable stay overall.
"i stayed here one week for my business and leisure trip.  The apartment is spacious, clean and well maintained.  The staff are very helpful, one night I left my phone at Grab car, they helped me to call the driver and return to me within an hour, much appreicated.  Location is close to KLCC & Pavilion, as well as Changkat where all the bars and restaurant are located, I already plan my next trip in Jan."
