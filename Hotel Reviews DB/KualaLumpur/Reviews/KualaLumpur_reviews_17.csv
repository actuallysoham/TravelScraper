"What a terrible check in queue up for one hour! And in lobby totally no social distance,when check out take half hour to get the lift to go down, life a lot of people all no social distance, In our New normal life , hotel never protect all customers and put all customer into high risk situation and I saw they allow all the kid play freedom in the lobby without cover face mask . All already take photo to prove for it"
"The hotel is very central, walking distance to Pavilion and KLCC. Had an enjoyable stay for my birthday, hotel gave me some delicious cakes! The pool was nice but crowded so have to avoid the peak hours. Hotel staff was friendly. One thing to improve though is the parking. Should just tell us we can use the other parking for free instead of having to circle round and round for parking."
"Booked two connected rooms at Pullman KLCC. The new renovated room is very nice, the food is great and the location is superb !. My comments as below: 1) Check-in is too long. 10 - 15 minutes per-room/person is too long. Please fix your system, reduce clicking and re-key in information. Example, I booked via Accor, by right you already have all my details, it should not take long to check-in, but it is still 11 minutes for me.  2) Banyan Tree now under Accor, please allow Pullman KLCC customer to use Banyan Tree pedestrian bridge to Pavillion. The road is dangerous and lot of snatch theft. For safety purpose, please allow Pullman customer to use Banyan bridge to Pavillion. 3) Improve your internal communication. I checked in on Friday, the parking lift breakdown and one hotel"
"Came in for a birthday occasion. While room was on the residence side, it was an apartment with all the facilities.i.e. Kitchenette, living table, sofa, fridge and whatnots.  What stood out for the stay was the a la carte dinner. It was fabulous. We had a wild mushroom soup, a ceasar salad, a tenderloin steak, half a dozen satay and two creme brulee (off menu). Orders were taken by Mr Mous, the restaurant manager of Sedap.  The dinner was served by Mr Shariff and his team of attentive staff. Now, amongst the dishes,  the steak and the wild mushroom soup were delectable, hitting every palate. The soup was rich in flavour. I was told the chef insisted fresh mushrooms used. My dining partner ladled up every single spoon. So was my steak. It came with portobello mushroom. The"
"I took the Kids More Fun Package.  The kids were really enjoyed. They had cupcake decorating session which is extremely Fun & Yummy. The cupcakes were nicely kept in a beautiful box  too.   The hotel provides a tent, plush toys, kid's sleeping bag and a small soft foldable chair too.. there were color pencils and few papers with printed activities for kids on the table. There were kids cookies sent to the room and they're so cute! Kids eat for free (kids menu) at restaurant. Adults can use RM 100 voucher to dine in.   The swimming pool was smaller than expected but we still love it. The housekeeping staffs were nice and generous.  The room was big with 2 LED TV. The sofa and bean bag were comfortable. There were kitchen and utensils provided. The dining table can fit for 4 pax."
"I have no problem with the front desk service, in fact,  they are excellent. Stayed 4D3N, and spend most of the time in the hotel room, relax and watch TV.   Realize there's some strange smell with the bed sheet and comforter, requested to change on the second day. We only utilized 1 time of housekeeping, as we did not leave the hotel room after that. Not very satisfy with it, as the glasses was not washed, and tea spoon still with stains.   My sinus kicked in on the second day... I wonder would it be the room has not been utilize for a while, and hence become dusty. After I left the hotel, my sinus recovered in half a day; and wife realize her back has plenty of ""red dot"", and become itchy."
"Check-in was smooth with the assistance of Norlida. Due to covid, the lounge has been shifted to the lobby where the food offering is quite good. Hosted by Nor, the service at the lounge was  Even during this challenging time, the hotel still offers a great buffet spread for breakfast, with strict compliance with COVID-19 protocol."
"Booked for a two nights stay at Pullman KLCC for the Executive Club Room [Using the Accor Plus ‘Stay 2 nights, pay for 1’ voucher]. Reservation department was very good, checked with me a couple of times regarding my bookings. My last email to the reservation department was to request for early check-in at noon as well as special requests for higher floor and a room facing away from construction sites or a close-up building.  Morning of my check-in I called up to Front Desk to check what time I could check-in. Was told my room would be ready for my early arrival.   CHECK-IN Room was ready and check-in process completed quickly. Room assigned was however not satisfactory due to its view being blocked by a nearby building. Thus, I called down to ask for a room change to another"
"Awesome service. Highly recommended. One of the few hotels still serving buffet breakfast during covid (yess!). They mitigate the risk by having only their staff to man the buffet stations and serve out the food. It is no more self service. During this time the hotel section is closed off and only the apartments are available (better value for money but more run down I suspect). The jacuzzi pool needs better maintenance: water was dark green and the water jets are powered off before 1pm, presumably to save money. Dark green water = not chlorinated, not clean. Eek. Service in the restaurant was top notch. Kudos to Tommy, Sue and team in Sedap Restaurant. Food was excellent. Seriously. Like caviar! Has some good menu items for low salt and low sugar for those who need it eg. the"
The room are small & pillows uncomfortable. There was no hot water in the shower despite the maintenance came and tried to rectify it once. So we had to shower in cold water. After that we just didn't bother cos it was already very late at night and early in the morning.  The checkout takes forever (which I couldn't understand why) and there was only 1 staff doing the super long check out. Staff wasn't even helpful & policies varies from people. My family took 3 rooms here - and all of us were charged on different amount on deposits - varying from 200 to 500. When I questioned the staff on duty all she told me was - it's just a deposit we will refund without any justification.  Wil not be back for sure
"We had the one bedroom for 2 nights and found mould on the tissue box as well as horrifying dusty vents in the bathroom. Staff were quick to rectify these after our first night but sadly our second night, the pillows smelled of cigarette. You can also hear construction noise the whole night. I understand the Residences side is older and sadly it really felt old and the furnishings felt and smelled old. It’s unfortunate cause the staff were trained well and the lobby was beautiful."
"Plus points:  1) strategic location nearby KLCC and right smack to pavillion 2) They have very good deal for in-house guest for the new year eve dinner, which is a lovely touch to appreciate customers! 3) I was greeted as a valuable member of Accor loyalty program and enjoyed the good hospitality throughout.My room was upgraded! TQ  Setbacks:  1) The hot shower didnt work in our 1st day and ended up showering with cold shower :(  2) No KLCC view 3) Very small pool and the pool bar was closed 4) Major setback! Pullman customers were no longer allowed to use the pedestrian bridge that connecting Banyan Tree hotel and pavillion! Its the same group of hotel, but very different treatment. It will be awesome to be able to use the bridge so you wont end up wet walking few more hundreds"
"When I arrive at the front desk, not only I was not greeted being an Accor Platinum member and the nightmare comes during departure where I needed to queue for almost 15 minutes despite I identified myself and there isn't any outstanding payment. Room noise isolation is horrible, one of the adjacent room was playing loud music past mid night and eventually shut off at 5am. F&B personnel Andy and Sue have been showing the true Pullman quality where I was being well attended by both - Well done!"
"Very good location to stay for a few days in KL center area. Convenient and comfortable to shop around especially  Pavillion. Alot choices for food, Hakka restaurant nearby highly recommended. Good service!"
Had a weekend stay during our birthdays due to the close proximity to our restaurant bookings and Pavilion.  It was a good stay and they had a coffee machine with different selection of pods in the room too. They even provided us a slice of cake for our birthday. Thank you!
We stayed only for few nights during our family trip to Asia.  Hotel is very conveniently located near to many attractions with one of the main attractions in KL - Petronas Twin Towers being only 15 min by foot form the hotel. Also one of the KL's biggest Shopping malls - Pavilion is only 3 min by foot form the hotel.  Hotel's lobby definitely has WOW effect - with extra high ceilings providing airy feeling. Check in was quick and smooth. We did have Premium Deluxe room (honestly was expecting bit better upgrade being Platinum Accor member) which was very nice newly refurbished on higher floor with nice views and all modern amenities. Being Accor Platinum members we were entitled to have access to Executive lounge - and this worth separate mentioning - I've been to many hotels
"Nice stay here. Every SOP for COVID-19 is followed the Accor standard. I would like Thank Margaraet for serve me during check in and Mohamad for assist me during my stay, he always ask me for anything that i need and try to fulfill my request. All staff here are politely greeting me every morning. I hope to again here soon. I would like recommend this hotel!"
"Checked in for a night for a short staycation after a long hiatus due to locality. With Pullman Bangsar coming into the end of an era, I thought of coming back here to attest the true hospitality again.   Check in and out was a breeze. Room was upgraded and well appointed with welcome amenities. Got the Premium grand deluxe category probably due to the membership of Accor.   PKLCC prided itself with a team of dedicated , sincere and hospitable staff who had gone the extra mile in delivering thier services. They had done it impeccably. I am sure any guests who walks in is treated as a distinguished guest.   From check in , staff like Farhan n others, Sophia , the club manager came to inform that the room was ready while I was having my complimentary afternoon tea. Sue and Mus was"
"First check in since March 20 before the lockdown. The Club Lounge is still closed but the afternoon tea and evening cocktail are served at the lobby level. They offer unlimited refill of pastries, fresh juices, coffee and tea during the afternoon tea session from 2-4pm, which is not bad in my opinion. The options for alcohol / cocktail (no more) during the evening session have been reduced compared with pre-lockdown, but I will still give them 80/100. Service is great and special thank to Tommy."
"Although have to spend my time at lobby for the lounge access , but the service was wonderful as same quality as in level 4 lounge . All my food and beverages was taking care and mr Tommy & mr Haziel the mostly friendly guy I ever met! Also nevertheless mr Rudin very hardworking guy as a waiter and serve in very kind way and polite. Sure will come back to stay again and see u all soon !"
"Have to improve a lot on breakfast (meal), not enough towel in swimming pool area and the hotel are charge executive lounge access with the hotel room price but they offered the executive lounge facility in the lobby restaurant (due to covid-19) with the limit choices."
"I've not written a review for ages but this needs to be shared. And intentionally dedicated time for this so people will know.  Initially tried to call ALL member hotline to book, was quoted a price cheaper than what i see online so i agreed to let the call agent confirm the booking for me. Everytime the agent could not answer my query she had to put me on hold, in total whole call took almost an hour and at the end i got pissed off because the rate quoted was not available anymore. Even worse when they can't use the card on file tied to my membership and i have to read out my card number on the phone. It was frustrating so i gave up and booked direct via website (after almost an hour on the phone and also getting a return call because the agent realised she held me too long on"
"The check in is terrible. Have to wait for 1 hour plus even for loyal members.  On online check in available  Only 4 counters working, when at least 30 people in the queue.   On complaining, they just apologize and do nothing.   Very sorry I choose to stay at Pullman in KL  Adil"
"Stayed during RMCO in a 2 bedroom apartment. Apartment was big enough for the 4 of us, both rooms was en-suite and there was another toilet in the apartment. Kitchen was small but it's good enough as we didn't cook. There was a microwave and stove in the kitchen.  Pool isn't big but was okay. Not crowded at all but no food or drinks served by the pool due to RMCO.  We had dinner at sedap restaurant. Steak and lamb chops were excellent tho the service was slow. We also had the set lunch there. Norwegian salmon was also very good.  Happy with our stay 👍🏻"
The hotel located near major shopping centers like pavilion and star hills.  Within walking distance.  Near money changer and convenience store. Equip with in house best Japanese restaurant and Chinese restaurants and club lounge for privacy
"My husband and i checked in and stayed in the hotel for 4 nights. Below are our feedback and comments:  Good points - Great locations. 5 mins walk to Pavilion, where you can find lots of restaurants and shops.  - Receptionist are helpful and friendly.  Rooms for improvements - No welcome platter in the room despite we are the platinum member. - Limited choices of alcoholic drinks during the cocktail sessions. Same set of desserts were served for the past 4 days.  - The lounge was closed and the breakfast and cocktails were served at the “Sedap” restaurant area. Despite there were not much guests to attend to, the service was still rather slow. The food served was cold while it is supposed to be at least warm/hot. - Breakfast quality was decent, but there were always some fruit"
booked the apartment unit but the smell of the unit is uncomfortable. Hence upgrate to junior suite. The reception staff was very helpful with the upgrade. But the breakfast the next morning was horrible. Understand there's no buffet breakfast.. am only allowed to order once for two adult. Mind u I have a 4 years old with me. Upon clarification with the staff there.. was told breakfast is only for adult. Kids don't get to eat. The staff answers as if I am begging for food.
"Overall this is a great hotel, with pretty nice rooms and great service.  I did find the area where breakfast is served gets very busy in the morning.  The location is very close to attractions, walking distance to Petronas Towers, the Pavillion Mall is across the street."
"Hotel location is strategic. 5-min walk to Pavilion mall. The hotel staffs are all nice. Many facilities were not open during the Recovery Movement Control Order (RMCO), however the hotel staffs provided us with some special treats inside room. Can't think of any better experience than what we had especially during this time, it was indeed a perfect stay."
"I decided to spend the weekend in KL with my family as the lock down eased. The normally busy hotel was strangely empty. Most food outlets were closed as were the gym and the pool. The club lounge was also closed. So, i was not able to enjoy this facility. Overall, the staff provided the service as best as they could. The only issue i had was that breakfast was served in the room and it took a long time to arrive. I was also not offered a customary welcome drink which was probably due to COVID 19. I hope that things will get back to normal soon."
"I really enjoyed my stay in Pullman hotel, I stayed in the hotel for 6 months and it was a great time, the staff is very friendly, special thanks to Chery, Christine and  Evelyn for their great service."
Stayed here for 3 nights the rooms was amazing and so where the staff nothing was too much trouble the breakfast was nice and the location was very good only a short walk away from the shops and the twin towers
"We have used this hotel for many years and were concerned that things would change when there  was a change of ownership............our concerns are baseless. Following acomplete re-furb the hotel has managed to keep the balance professionalism and friendlyness. The staff make the hotel our ""home from home"" when in KL. It is unfair to single out any individual as it is acomplete team effort.........carry on the good work"
"Couldn't have wanted for a better  place to stay. Everyone were kind, courteous and wanting to please in a most professional manor.  The one bedroom apartment was spacious, clean and functional. Thanks to Kiran for all your great room cleaning - it was always nice to return after you had serviced the room. The dinning room was well catered with an extensive menu selection of lovely fresh food choices. Thank you to Puvan for delivering my breakfast every day, very much appreciated. The pool area and poolside bar was always kept immaculate. Tommy and the team were always polite and efficiently accommodating. They are a great asset to the hotel.  The reception and concierge were most obliging and nothing was too small for them to attend to. Additionally, the Pullman KL CC is only"
"Nice hotel with warm welcome from all the staff ! Special thanks to Arissa , for helped us with the room deco ! We never thought of getting some nice set up and delicious birthday cake that time ! She really did a great job ! Should’ve come  to Pullman next time for any special occasion. Great great great .   Breakfast is nice . Room is well maintained !"
"Have never experienced such a great place to be, Pullman Hotel indeed exceeded my expectations in KL.  The best part of it all was the excellent house keeping, very kempt, all personal items secure in addition to house keeping service with a smile. This made my stay worthwhile and a memory to keep forever... Big up @BilnaRose. #Very Professional!."
"Thanks to the wonderful staff at the Pullman City Centre Hotel. They ensured my comfort at all times and were friendly and courteous. I would particularly like to thank the staff members on duty at the concierge desk who deal with multiple and varied requests which cover a variety of issues. You can literally ask them any question regarding tour activities, booking Uber transport etc which they did for me, helping me with the damaged frames for my reading glasses etc. A special thanks to Ibrahim, a delightful young man, who stood diligently waiting for my airport transport to arrive. This ensured that I could sit comfortably in the airconditioned lobby without having to stand outside waiting. Thank you Pullman staff for an enjoyable week. Many regards, Dianne Redhead (Room 2032)."
"Stayed there from 30 Jan 2020 to 02 Feb 2020 - Stayed in #1401, turn left 1st room on the left, room facing pool view. We have a very nice time although it was a very short period. Staff were amazing and super helpful. Kudos to Cheryl, Sham and the others. Apologies if I could not remember all their names. Only thing was there was an aircon leaking in our room in one of the nights that we stayed but that matter was resolved by the technician with no sweat! Thank you all for such a Superstar and Awesome! We like it so much that we are coming in again today!"
My experience in this hotel was verry positive: the staff verry helpfull and nice to us. Specially Ahmed who helped us with our luggage and come up with great recommandtions of places to visiti in Kuala Lumpur. He even order Grab for us while we didn't have internet.  The rooms were very big and clean with a wonderfull view. Next time i will definitelly come back there.  Thank you for everything
"Ahmad that works here is amazing, he told us all the best places to go to. The rooms are amazing. Pullman is a beautiful hotel. Will definitely recommend this to anyone that is interested. Can wait to do some more exploring."
"I spent 3n on a biz trip in apartment with breakfast. I didn’t really use the mini kitchen with stove and m/w, I hoped the apartment had a washing machine, having already traveled more than a week. I appreciated the spaciousness, however it’s kind of basic and I’d say even a bit oldish. The room had no windows. The WC had a very annoying water leak which was promptly fixed. Location is very central, in a busy area (Bukit Bintang) just opposite a famous mall Pavilion. In my opinion the best of the hotel was the breakfast. So many choices but the top was the roti canai station, absolutely fantastic. So were the freshly squeezed juices. Overall a good option to stay in central KL but the apartment IMHO would need a bit of a renovation."
"It was short stay and there was nothing to complaint about. Standard high service quality that is expected of Pullman - the check-in and check-out was smooth, the room was new and great. The location is of course, great - just next to Pavilion mall."
Kual lumpur  wonderful city. 😎😎😎 has many  places  to visit. Like  petronas towers. Batu Caves  kl tower   sultan Abdul samad building  central market  kula lumber city gallery and national mosque  (masjid negara)
"Amazing hotel, almost every week we stay here and thank u Ahmad (concierge) for u are very helpful. Thanks all the information about Kuala Lumpur. Check in is very fast, breakfast a lot of choice and delicious. Definitely we will come back here again."
"The hotel has a good environment, staffs are very friendly and have pretty good service attitude. The Staff Ahamad actually gave us a lot of tips to visit KL. Overall pleasant experience. I will choose here next time I come to Kuala Lumpur"
The residence apartment is huge and clean. Very friendly staffs and Ahmad was especially helpful with all the queries. Shopping is a stone throw away.Great buffet and massage! Will definitely come back here again.
Good hotel.im stay on this hotel very comfortable.all staff very friendly specialy Ahmad at the concierge dept.we are very happy .breakfast a lot of choices and very near by to shopping mall.walk distance.we love Pullman klcc
"First time at this hotel, it’s quite big but the staff and the grand deluxe room was excellent, terrific view as well, although we didn’t get a chance to use it the pool looked fab. Breakfast was a real treat offering a wide range from around the world. The staff here really are excellent and when we left I really wished we had booked another night or two.  Will be back as soon as possible"
"Our fourth time here, location is great, so central to everything and in walking distance.  hotel decor is new and modern, the bar upstairs is great and music by La Dada was entertaining and fun.  great sounds we always get a appartment style room, it was good, lots of room than a hotel room.  service by Hazel at breakfast, and our room cleaner Amar is great. thanks so much for cleaning our room to perfection every day Amar.  pool area is really nice, although the food and drinks service could be a bit more active as it took a while to get drinks ordered.  (no worries).     we shall be back again.  many thanks"
Nice hotel. Faster check  in. Nice lobby. Staf very friendly. Thank  you concierge especially Ahmad. Very help full. Pullman klcc kuala lumpur one often best hotel. Bed. In the room also very comfortable
"The hotel under went a big remodel and it perfect for local malls and tourist sites and equally walking distance to many place.  It has a great executive lounge.  I was sad my feet turn blue since the pool doesnt take the chill out of the water, once in it didnt get any warmer"
"Stayed in February. Hotel had good occupancy and seemed to have a mix of corporate  and individual travellers  Breakfast was a good display, some items much better quality  than others. The chef on the roti station makes fantastic bread :) the Indian food was wonderful and flavoursome. the one upgrade at breakfast i would suggest is the coffee"
"One of the best lounge and service within the business district. The lounge with all the crew they have are all amazing. As an Accor platinum  member, I am able to maximise my benefits as Accor Member.  I love the gym and pool. There are array of restaurant within the hotel to choose from ."
Very good hotel with a good experience! Thanks for Ahmad   Concierge for good service! We stay in this hotel very nice and very close to shopping mall. Definitely we will comeback again. Swimming pool at 10floor it was very nice
"Very friendly and helpful staff, and a great location, close to shopping and dining options.   Room was clean and extremely comfortable indeed, the Petronas Towers are within easy walking distance, and the KL Craft Centre is a short walk up Conlay Road.   The nearest metro station is perhaps ten minutes walk away, so easy enough, although not right on the doorstep.   This last part is absolutely NOT the fault of the hotel, and nor does it reflect badly upon them, but the taxi driver who picked us up at the hotel tried to significantly overcharge us for our airport transfer. He backed down when I told him I'd been told a lower price by the hotel, but I'd still advise downloading Grab, the local Uber equivalent, to avoid this sort of thing.   Back to the hotel, we enjoyed our"
"stunning hotel  located next to Pavilion 7 storey shopping mall.All shops  are within 10 minute walk .

"Stayed 1 Night in Kuala Lumpur in the two room family apartment. Great hotel and very friendly staff, always helpful and smiling. Very clean, with a large outdoor pool and kids room with a lot of entertainment. Very delicious and fresh breakfast buffet. Will definitely book again if we visit KL another time."
"Excellent service, inviting ambiance with the sunlight coming through... plenty of selections.🤗 I was looking for a nice shrimp soup and in response Chef Azizan prepared a lovely bowl😅 to satisfy my craving!!!🥰 Thank you, friendly staffs👍.. looking forward to revisiting this lovely city and hoping to stay here again. Alan-Cherry"
Spent three nights at this hotel. It was superb. Couldn't fault it at all. Great location. We booked a car via the hotel to pickus up a the airportm and was there waiting for us. Checkin was smooth and staff very friendly. Room large and clean. Pool on the tenth floor was great. Breakfast each morning was excellent. If ever back in KL will certainly return. Thank you.
My go-to hotel when I'm in KL. Love the hospitality. Room is clean and huge. Accessible to mall within walking distance. Hotel staff are friendly and checking in and out is seamless. Great view of KL too.
Check in was smooth and the bed and pillow were very comfortable. The breakfast selection was fantastic. Breakfast could have been perfect if there were no flies and the table mat was cleaned before the table was made available to the next diner.
Fast c in comfortable bed.very nice room.nearby to shopping mall walk distance.thank you Ahmad concierge for assistance me.you are very kind and friendly 😃 Very friendly room service and delicious food
"Good Service and Friendly staff member recommended for the stay in Kuala lumpur will come back for next visit.  Great location nearby walking distance to anywhere else. Just opposite the pavilion mall Fazrul ,#1721"
"amazing staff very welcoming, fazrul is very humble and helpful nice staff very warm  Very nice ambiance and great infrastructure room had a good view and I enjoyed my stay  Was here for 3 days and will definitely come back again"
There are two or three Pullman hotels in Kuala Lumpur. This one is the Pullman Kuala Lumpur City Centre. It has just had a major renovation to a good standard of art deco type interior design. Has Japanese and Chinese restaurants as well as a cigar bar on level 1.
"Fancy lobby, friendly staffs particularly Ahmad Concierge, fast check in and neat room. Good walking distance to Pavilion. Yummy food, sparkling pool with the tall trees and very shady. The gym opens 24 which is a great access."
"The only word that can describe the Pullman is ""Prefect"" from its ambience to its staff everything about this location is just perfect.    Our flight was in the morning and I dreaded thinking it would be a late check-in. But the ever green, ever friendly, staff was not going to let that happen. We were greeted by Amy, who was wonderful and assisted us with our check-in and a special mention to Cheryl the front desk officer (who recognized me from my previous business visit) who promptly ensured that our apartment was made available. Amy proceeded to inquire about our plans for the day and gave some stellar recommendations for restaurants for our dinner dates.   This brilliant experience was not confined to just our check-in, the staff at Pullman are always attentive, caring &"
"As the NCov scare looms, we were having second thoughts continuing with our trip to KL. All the worries are gone after arriving at Pullman KL. All the staff from door man to reception made us feel safe and secure. The hotel is very clean. Even the room service cleaner made sure to disinfect the room.  We booked 2-bedroom apartment. The room is huge and stylish. The hotel is conveniently located right across Parkson Elite Dept store and walking distance to most attractions and restaurants. Hakka by the way is just beside the hotel. Special shout out to Joey. Check-in/check-out is a breeze.  I will definitely come back"
"Door man inform that Clean shoe only allowed to enter for meeting at Pullman KLCC ground floor cafe. This is so call friendly? and the attitude of Pullman KLCC staff is not right at all, rate itself as 5Star hotel? please prove it and change your attitude"
"Very nice, modern and renovated hotel. Perfect location, 10min walking distance from.the Petronas towers.  Very good service and very friendly staff. Great swimming pool (open until 10pm) and well furnished fitness room.  Executive suite is spacious and amenities are of high quality.  Executive lounge is great (if you have access). Great bed quality.  To be noted that there is no view to the Petronas towers anymore due to a new building in construction inbetween.  Only noticeable improvement to be made is on the food - not as tasty as in other Pullman hotels in Asia (main restaurant and pool bar). In the lounge, a description of what is being served in the buffet area would be helpful."
"Stayed here for 4 nights the location of this hotel is very convenient for getting into the centre, and you can even walk to the twin towers by covered walkway by going into the Banyan Tree hotel and going up one floor by lift and you can walk most places  under cover especially while we were there the rain was monsoon.   The service in this hotel is very good and friendly only complaint was the main restaurant for breakfast which was very chaotic no hot water for tea, we were fortunate enough as we had a room that let us use the club lounge where we took breakfast in the mornings.  The staff in the club lounge were very good we were served by Vinny,Sue,Syamir,Kamal and Angi who looked after all our needs exceptional, apologies if I have missed anyone out.  Would highly"
"The hotel has excellent location near the hustle bustle of the KL City and many tourist attractions. From Petronas Tower to the Bukit Bintang, Berjaya Times Square, Pavilion Mall everything is at walking distance."
Very friendly welcoming environment. Thanks to all staffs especially Hakemi and Ahmad for their sincere welcoming smile and service. Foods are great and room is clean and spacious... the hotel is also near pavilion mall and jln Bukit bintang. Great place to stay in KL.
"Super stay at Pullman. Lounge service is very good, we really enjoyed the nice  breakfast, thee time and apero time. Next time we will come back. Hotel is very close to KLCC and the pavillion male. Thanks you so much for the nice service."
"It always feel like home here. It makes me feel comfortable on my trip. Always warm welcoming by staff members, from doorman to concierge. My concierge, Ahmad has been a great help and very friendly indeed. Good job 👍🏽"
Pullman is convenient and beautiful. Thank you  Ahmad concierge for the warm welcome. Good job Pullman. We all have a good time. It’s been a pleasant trip for my boss and myself.   Thanks for the whole team and also the Accor plus manager
"Back to what is without doubt my favorite hotel in KL. As usual the room was perfect. The hotel has a FANTASTIC club lounge. A massive thanks to Sophia, Yinny, Ang, Ida, Cardine, Kamal, Sue, Raihan and Syamir. You guys deserve a pat on the back for a job well done for making my nights away from home more tolerable. You are all a credit to the hotel and the Accor group. I can't wait to come back soon !"
"The Pullman City Centre is one of the best hotels in the world for us. It has been recently renovated, modern with beautiful decor. The service was excellent from the moment we arrive - from reception to the rooms.  Our room was very clean.  I would like to mention Kiran who prepared our room. He did an excellent job.  We had breakfast in the executive lounge. The staff Sofia, Sue, Kamal, Ida, Caroline, Ang, Riehan, just to mention a few, made sure we are well taken care of. always service with a smile and nothing was a problem. The food was very good - plentiful and lots of variety.  Their pool is for us the best pool in KL as it has a lovely bar and garden. There again the service is amazing. Tommy and his team are always cheerful and friendly.  We want to thank everyone at"
"We stayed for two nights in this hotel. The location of the hotel is right behind the Pavilion Mall (Bukit Bintang street) and there is a bridge that connects to the mall only a short walk from the hotel, so it is perfect. The service was excellent, the room was spacious and clean. The lobby area is huge. We would stay again in this hotel."
"Stayed for a week at the Pullman KLCC which was almost a perfect flawless stay.  Booked a hotel transfer from the airport and although more expensive than a taxi it made for a hassle free trip to the hotel with being met at the airport by a hotel representative and escorted to our waiting car  We were met at the hotel by Sophia (ECL Manager) who escorted us to the lounge while explaining the hotels features and facilities for a fast and easy check in.  The room was a Grand Delux with ECL access and was large, tastefully furnished with a mix of differently designed furniture that all blended together.  Being a corner room it had a massive curved panorama window which once would have amazing views of the Petronas towers (like many hotels in KL they get built out) but still had"
Hotel is very and all sfaff ist good breakfast is fantice and All Shop Shopping All near to fine one Off staff Name Gobi is wonderful Service and like Tell thanks him Will come again to Kl i Hope to See again
"Loved the ambience loved the hospitality loved the room. We checked in on 31st Jan, we arrived at the hotel at 7.30 and was pleased to receive an early check in. We were also given the top most floor and all of this completely voluntary by the staff. Cheryl at the check in counter was such a helpful and friendly person made us feel welcome instantly. Amy guest officer took the time to actually to suggest places of visit, restaurants that we would enjoy and Raghu the conceige took the liberty of double checking our reservation at dining in the dark. What's amazing is that these people didn't have to do any of that but they went that extra mile completely voluntary and that's why when in KL Pullman it will be our first choice. Thank you Cheryl, Amy and Raghu excellent customer"
The hotel provided an excellent customer service especially the lounge services on 4/F of the hotel. The staff SVAMIR in particular made good cocktails for me and my friend every day and the friendly manner of him provided the best hospitality experience I have ever had so far.
Excellent rooms that are very spacious.  Hospitality is beautiful. We stayed in room 1735  The room is very comfortable and the swimming pool on the 10th floor is clean and spacious.   Thanks Ahmad from Concierge for the help and you are very friendly!
"3 night stay 22/01/20 arranged transfers with hotel no issues we stayed in a club room I think it’s worth paying a little extra for ala-carte breakfast afternoon tea and evening drinks include in the price plus other perks, Just saves the hassle of the buffet breakfast on the first floor, our room 2809 was spacious and comfortable, nice bathroom, pool area and bar really good lots of drinks offers all through the hotel, went to the second floor to watch the resident duo Harris and was made to feel really welcomed asked us if we wanted them to sing a song for us and encouraged to dance, did firefly tour with Metro tours just the two of us a driver and guide all organised by the hotel and not expensive, some say there’s not much of a view from the hotel this is easily rectified by"
"Perfect hotel and mostly nice staff.  Gobi, the guy helping us with luggage and the main concierge were very helpful and made the stay very nice.  Good location for exploring the city, nice breakfast and nice rooms."
"Checked in by Kelvin, a smiley gentleman who was professional and pleasant to deal with. Our room was not ready at 12noon so we went across to Pavilion for lunch. Was told we were being upgraded, what a nice surprise! Breakfast was delicious, I think this was way better than our 1st stay in 2016. Well Done Pullman, with such competitive market in KL you certainly stood out!   Kind regards Christy & family Auckland New Zealand"
It’s a very good hotel to relax and have a good experience from their staff Ahmad concierge he’s a best staff I never meet before😃😃  The Hotels.com is big enough for my parents they love to cook inside and have some delicious dinner by ourselves so here is every good for family trip😄😄
"Warm and supportive team. Right from the entry you are supported all the way to checkin and checkout. One outstanding personality I met is Gobi, a warm person, who accommodate all request. Food is awesome1"
"Great hotel We had a family suite for 4 nights Opositte Pavilon mall & not far from tourist sites. Friendly staff, great spacious rooms. Quality is top. Gave free umbrellas to use during rainy days. Service was top. Staff always willing to help.  Only downside was breakfast not much choice in the buffet. This was the only downside and needs to be improved. Need more veg selection too  Otherwise this is a top hotel to stay to visit sites and family friendly!"
Very good hotel and friendly staff specially Ahmed (concierge). Breakfast was excellent. Less crowded. Room very spacious and clean. Close to shopping mall. Staff smiling and always happy to help.  I would recommend anyone anytime thanks. Suleiman Australia
We stayed two nights in mid-December and were pleased to see the hotel so nicely decorated. A massive Christmas tree and sparkling gingerbread house!   We stayed on the 18th floor for two nights. Our room was spacious and clean. I would have liked to explore the rooftop oasis but it was heavily raining during our time at the hotel. One of my favourite parts was the breakfast in Sedap restaurant - I've never seen so much choice before and I've travelled to many destinations! The waitress was also friendly when I attempted to say Selamat Pagi to her so we left feeling quite happy.  The only negative was that we did not get our sheets changed overnight - unfortunately we must have signalled for Do not Disturb after mistaking the buttons on the wall for light switches (see picture).
"Pullman KLCC has a great location. It is directly opposite Pavilion, one of the premium shopping mall in KL and is connected via a linked bridge next door (at Banyan Tree hotel lobby).   The check in, check out experience and the interaction with the staff were fantastic in almost all venues. The staff did approach me several times to check if I need any help.   The room we booked was one bedroom apartment and it was truly spacious and we liked it a lot. The game room is the place the kids wont want to leave. They have Xbox and Xbox kinect, table tennis, one small playaround.  The breakfast was good as well, and we liked the ENJU Japanese restaurant a lot.  Will definitely revisit the hotel."
"My Family spent 3 nights in a 2 bedroom apartment in January 2020.  Our apartment was extremely large and well laid out with ensuites coming off both bedrooms.  There was a large kitchen and a very large lounge area.  We had a great view from the 26th floor.  The lobby, restaurant and pool areas were of a high quality.  We only ate breakfast at the hotel which had an extensive variety.  The location was great and access to the Pavillion Mall and its restaurants and cafes was very handy and Bukit Bintang area on the other side of the mall from the hotel.  Overall we had a great stay and would highly recommend the hotel."
"We stayed for almost two nights for our honeymoon, we received the room with dust everywhere even in the bathroom , and when we went for breakfast, the restaurant Female staff reception was very rude with us ."
"First time Came here for lunch with bunch of friends and partner at Sedap . The food was okay . Very quite place except when all the tourist came the place become a bit noisy and crowded since the Sedap is close to reception counter . A bit confused how to get to parking , luckily theres a staff at lobby name arisa or alisa assist we all to parking . The concierge staff i dont remember but he is really helpfull too . Friendly staff . Just the toilet at lobby a bit small . Will come here again to try out their other restaurants . Nice hotel"
"Such great disappointment with this hotel. Having high expectations since it was under Accor group. Generally I can say that the service quality is below 3 stars Hotel. Breakfast was a disappointing meal. Lack to choices, slow refills. The service at the coffee place, the junction is a disgrace. Tables were not cleaned properly and can see stains. Sat there for 30 minutes but no one came to serve. Leftover on tables were not cleaned immediately. Went to lounge, the staff were busy chit chatting loudly instead of concentrating on the guests needs. Rooms were dusty. Hair dryer not provided. Booked two rooms with breakfast and were told that only one room has breakfast. Stayed in so many other Accor group hotels including Fairmont, Sofitel and Ibis, this is probably the worst"
"Nice room, clean and spacious. The service is good. Especially the bellboy- Azlan. Thanks for the great hospitality. All staffs are polite and fast for check in n check out. The hotel is walking distance to all malls. Easily to find foods."
Have stayed here several times. Always happy to return.  Am accor platinum member and received royal treatment. All staff great but special mention for Yinny and chef Syamsul for the excellent gluten free meals
We are holiday here for two days one night. Get good service from check-in. Thank you Mr. Ahmad (concierge) always smile when served us. Nice counter service too.  The room serve by Mr. Kamal was great. The pool as clean as usual.
