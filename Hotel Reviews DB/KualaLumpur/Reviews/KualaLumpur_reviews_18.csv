I've got best price during flashy deals on Thursday. Deluxe room is complimentary upgrade for KLCC view if stay during weekdays only.  I love the hotel as it more quiet and easy access to KLCC by buggy. Car parking is complimentary. The deals doesn't provide free breakfast.  Hopefully Traders Hotel can do more promotions in future.
We came to celebrate our daughter's birthday and going to Aquaria KLCC. The Executive Room is totally worth to spent on. Also the staffs are all very helpful and friendly. We will definitely coming back here!
Best. Great Services. All staff should receive 5 months BONUS for this year. They works perfectly helping clients all the times. Smile always even nobody having bad mood in this pandemic situation. They deserve for 5 months BONUS this year.
Hospitality is top notch. Staff is superb. everything is superb. My family and i enjoyed our stay there. Bravo to all staff members. You still can deliver a very good hospitality in this difficult and challenging condition.
We stay for my husband function. Level 22..Room quite big and bathroom also big and clean. The bed really comfortable.. Walk about 10 minit to the shopping  complex inside the Petronas Twin Tower. Don't forget to get up early and have a really taste and verity breakfast.
"Stayed here for a quick weekend getaway (March 27, 2021). This was my 3rd time staying in Traders Hotel, after a few years gap. I’ve always loved this hotel mainly due to its location and the comfortable stay.   I stayed here during the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) and just like any other hotels around the world, strict SOPs are implemented and must be adhered to - which is of course, why not.   However, I am not sure why, the check-in process was terribly SLOW. I was only queuing behind 4 guests, but oh dear, it took about good 45-50 mins before it was my turn! Only 5 staffs were attending the check-in process. Apparently, guests MUST provide a copy of IC / passport for EACH and everyone staying in the rooms booked. Well, I do understand this is the rule anywhere,"
The Weekend Gateway package is highly recommended if u r looking for the extra hours!! Early checkin at 11am and late checkout at 4pm does make a difference especially if u r traveling with kids & babies. Don't forget to book your swimming slot few days before checkin to avoid frustration especially during peak period.
"Thank you for the free upgrade for our room due to our honeymoon.  We stayed at room 2911 from 29 March until 1 April 2021.  The room service was excellent, the staff at service center were always helpful.  The direct view of Suria KLCC and Petronas Twin Tower is magnificient to say the least!  We plan to visit again every quarter of the year.  We were a bit disappointed that we did not get access to Club Evening Cocktail on our last night there.  Also we were not granted late checkout until 3pm on our last day but that's alright"
Lovely break in the city. Nice change to break the routine. The hotel seem to adhere to safety and the social distancing guideline well. The parking is tight and requirement to validate each and every time upon exit is a pain.
"Traders Hotel is No.1 if you're looking for KLCC view(and purposely book a room with a view). Check in was smooth, everything you need can just be Whatsapp-ed by the QR code send by the staff. Should improve on the cleanliness of the windows if you book a room with KLCC view. A simple decor for birthday celebration was provided by the staff for me. Buffet breakfast not so varieties if compares with other hotels. Anything else is awesome and can be repeat."
Very clean..staff really friendly and helpful..best location ..i love it..i will suggested to my friend and family to stay here... Really recommended and im happy to stay here .. Please maintaim your service like this...
"Thanks for very recent Thursday flash sales, due to that we had chance to book our latest staycation in the KL city. staying period between sunday to tuesday, we entitle for free upgrade from deluxe room to deluxe twin tower view room. overall, we had a good staying experience during our staycation. Luckily we manage to enter correct parking for hotel guest and enjoy complimentary parking throughout our stay period. Smooth luggage drop off at the lobby and smooth check in at Level 5 main reception. Those with children, make sure you book swimming slot to avoid child frustration during your stay. The pool operated with limited number of guest at the pool and no separate pool for children. We lucky, we manage to enjoy 1 swimming slot every day since our  checked in date till"
"Wonderful experience for my first visit to Traders. Nothing to complain. Thank you for all the arrangement that you add to our staycation. I'm totally happy and surprised from your team. My kids had much fun during our stay.   Much love,"
"It was a very great and enjoyed family trip. My kids were very happy and enjoyed and stayed in Traders. The room is clean, staffs are friendly and helpful. The swimming pool is clean. Location is good and very near to KLCC, it just a 10 minutes walk to KLCC."
"Hotel located approximately 100m from Klcc Twin Tower/ Suria Klcc, connected by LRT to other parts of KL, friendly staff, clean room, great view, very close to Klcc Park, highly recommended especially fir family trip,"
"Reservation: Making room reservations was a hassle, have to use 3 emails to ask for details needed. Cannot ask in one shot.  Food: The hotel was understaffed, breakfast has to queue very long and by the time it’s ur turn the food was out of stock. The dinner buffet was ok, as it is MCO u have to wait for the staff to get the food for you, but some of the staff(the sushi guy) is slow in service (u stand in front of him for minutes, and he will just ignore you) yet some of the staffs( seafood guy) is friendly.  Room: The room was clean. Mine with twin tower view.   Departure: double charges my room rate despite I had already paid for the room.due to the entire experience I feel like I need to double check where I usually don’t.   Massage: massage was ok barely pass. Not"
"Exceptional room, services and facilities, very affordable and located at the heart of city centre KLCC convention centre,  Malaysia iconic twin tower, park and polish shopping malls and edutainment centers like Petrosains and Aquaria"
"Traders Kuala Lumpur is located right at the heart of the Capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur. With the most magnificent view of the twin tower, KLCC, one of the landmarks of Malaysia. I like to stick to people and the environment that I have gotten to trust. That's why I always go back to the same places because they never let me down. Traders Kuala Lumpur has a gem, besides the view, the Shangri-la expectations. Traders KL has gotten herself a wonderful duty manager name, Abby.  Abby is passionate, caring and she is always there for me, whenever I stay with Traders. Leaving a memorable experience for me and my guests. She will always go the extra mile to enhance the quality of customer satisfaction and give service from the heart. This, the people of Shangri-la makes the hotel"
"Parking: Excellent. Check in : Excellent. Room : Excellent (next time would request 1 Queen + 1 Single : for 2 Adult & 3 Children), the mattress and pillows are superb comfortable. Dining: Excellent services and variety choice of food (buffet for breakfast). Buggy service: Excellent (Staff/ driver very friendly). Check out: Excellent."
"I booked Traders Hotel for my birthday staycation. Made a call prior to check in to know whether it’s ready or not and Ms Pebbles said all ready. Great. A very nice person. Upon check in, was welcomed by Ms Michelle and she offered me to the Level 32 Lounge to check in because at the lobby was abit packed. Checked in by Ms Tracy. Smooth. Amazing. Went down for evening cocktail at the Club Lounge and was served by Mr Arthur, great guy and tremendous service as well. And the Concierge Mr Badrul was very helpful. The morning buffet was splendid. with all the SOPs in placed, couldn’t be worried more about social distancing with the great assisted buffet set up. Next morning, went down to the pool (need to book in advance because of Covid SOP, which is very good and i feel safe"
"Traders Hotel KL is absolutely stunning. From the second my husband and I came in, we were greeted with so much love by the concierge guys, brought us up to the Lobby, then we got the best Front Office staff, named Mr. Vincent. We checked in at 11pm and he was so so so kind, his hospitality and warmth is really something to look up to. He gave us complimentary late check out, in his words, “so you can enjoy the Skybar” because he knew I was down for arriving late and not getting the chance to go into the Skybar as it was already closed for the night, that was wonderful from him.  The room is wonderful, huge bed, amazing bathroom, spacious, everything was so detailed.. Service great, everything great. Didn’t get a chance to have any food there but definitely the next time I will"
"Very nice hotel. Very good and helpful staff. Very clean. One of the best location in town, near Petronas Tower and Malls. Easy to go everywhere by taxi or by foot. Nice view from the room. The breakfast could be improved."
"Had spent a night with family and kids to celebrate my birthday. Stayed at room no 2403 exactly facing Twin Tower. The sky was blue at day and magnificient view at night. Food ordered for room service was awesome. Same goes for menu for breakfast. However, swimming pool and spa were closed following rules imposed by the government due to pandemic. Received complimentary cupcakes & balloons as well. It was so lovely. Thank you!"
"One night syaycation at one bedroom suite, offering maginificient view of Petronas Twin Tower. Size is quite spacious, around 48sqm, with separate living area, bathtub and standing shower.  Although I am local and borned in KL, but I never get bored with the alluring twin tower view from the suite. More importantly, I would like to say thank you to Rachel at reception, who still remember me and my preferences, everytime I come back to stay at the hotel.  I hope the covid 19 pandemic will be end soon, so that people around the world can visit Kuala Lumpur and stay at Traders, one of the best hotel within KLCC area with amazing view."
"I stayed at Traders Hotel as birthday treat. It was a perfect choice and also perfect timing as I checked out right before the lock down. From the arrival until departure, all the staffs was very helpful and kind to attend to my queries and also requests. The buggy service to KLCC was an extra point too."
The hotel's service is the best we've been served. We would like to express our sincere appreciation for the arrangement in the room for our honeymoon. Thank for you warm hospitality! The staff are really helpful.
"A perfect staycation experience with Traders Hotel. Everything is amazing right from the cleanliness of the room, staffs who are friendly and attentive and a special touch of sanitization kit apt for the current pandemic situation. Above all, the room with the spectacular view of the Twin Tower was simply stunning. The wide choices of breakfast and the midnight owl menu for dine in was definitely good for those who are awake at wee hours. However, there was one little glitch. My toddler had experienced few bugs/insects bites on his hands and legs. But otherwise, its all good. Thank you for the fantastic experience, Traders Hotel team!"
Very satisfied with the room view & everything except that we were disappointed that the new year's eve package that i booked although cost me 2 night rm1400+ which is more expensive than normal rates but there's no fireworks at klcc like usual. It was supposed to be my husband's birthday as well. Just no luck though
"you can sure get the best view of twin tower you could ever imagine.  there is minor improvement need to be done : 1) upgrade guest room tv since its outdated, 2) upgrade internet/wifi for in house guest"
"The KLCC view is superb from the room, no blocking. Day and night view is priceless. Hence, please book room with KLCC view, even is more expensive but is worth every penny. Highly recommended for people looking to stay nearby KLCC, just walking distance and Hotel also provide free buggy if you don't want to walk to KLCC. Staffs is friendly and attentive. Room is very clean. Hotel also provide free parking for in house guest."
"I have made a reservation since early Sept for a 2 night stay on 31 Dec through Agoda.  I find it strange that the hotel instead of Agoda had billed my credit card directly in Oct 2020 but paid no heed to it.   When I checked with the hotel a few days ago to confirm my reservation, they claimed not to have received payment and requested for payment again. After checking with Agoda and my credit card issuer on my payment which had been successfully collected by the hotel, they still claimed that they have not received payment.  Only when I wanted to file a police report for a fraudulent transaction by the hotel and data privacy breach that the hotel reverted to confirm they have received payment. This is such a disappointment to receive such service  before my stay!  I hope my"
"Room is a bit dated, amenities are scare, TV screen unattractive, Breakfast left too much to be desired price per head is >RM70. Although being a member of the Golden Circle, there is not much benefit received during 3D2N trip"
It was wonderful experience. All staff were so kind and welcoming. Room was very clean and maintain good level of hygiene. The breakfast was great with fresh juice. Definitely we will return in this hotel again.
Allowed early check in and late check out. friendly staffs. clear environment. lot of hand sanitizer provided. followed SOP. thank you for the complimentary birthday deco and cupcakes. The evening cocktails can serve more hot snacks and food which currently i think is too light and not satisfied.
"Stayed for a night on 23/12/2020, everything I'd okay ...Only issue is parking. Needs to have a big signage direction to the hotel carpark. Other then that everything is okay.  Staff is very helpful, check-in was fast."
The view of the room is superb ..facing klcc and as well as I can see there is KL Tower .The breakfast is delicious too. The service team are friendly. Check in and check out is good. The toilet is clean and spacious.
"memorable experience with Traders Hotel KL with friendly staff, clean room and cozy environment. excellent services from staff. just infront of klcc park and they provide buggy service to suria klcc shopping mall."
"Being a passion traveller and been in so many hotels around the world i must admit this is one of the best hotels! My room view is spectacular, the hotel staff are very friendly and welcoming. Absolutely will come back!"
this is the second time I m staying in traders for staycation. i enjoy the room very much as the view is so nice facing twin towers. and I never expect the foods in sky bar are so delicious.  highly recommend.
Superb and highly recommended. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Good vibes. Nice surrounding. Feels like a very welcome guest. The facilities well maintained. Kids were very happy with the KLCC view
"Everything about the room is perfect! Really a first for me... such perfections!!! My only wish is that I WANT TO STAY HERE AGAIN!! clean, quiet, great for a relaxing stay, excellent as a venue for WORK FROM HOME too."
"Stayed in a beautiful room with fantastic views of Petronas Towers. The room was modern, clean and comfortable. The staff were all friendly and helpful. A great breakfast with a large variety of options was the perfect way to start each day. The location is close to numerous restaurants and lots and lots of shopping. loved walking the ares near and surrounding the hotel. I would gladly stay at Traders on my next visit to KL."
"I was surprisedly upgraded to Deluxe Room with KLCC View. Thanks for the welcome gesture and i had a really superb view of KLCC during my stay, day and night. It's just beautiful. Will put as one of my ideal staycation hotel."
Clean and spacious for executive twin tower view room ..  The ideal choice if you looking for the KLCC view stay .  The mobile check In is fast and convenient . Within 5 mins you will get your room number through the app .
"Thank you once again for the excellent services during my stay there!

"Traders Hotel by Shangri-la is not Shangri-la but offers FANTASTIC on point Shangri-la service to their guests. This is a 5* hotel that seems to know you. The duty manager ABBY is a joy to be with, her genuine interaction with the guests generate a homely feeling that is professional, cheerful and a vibrant breathe of fresh air.   Breakfast items were limited however, it will be overlooked by the view of the twin tower. THE VIEW, that is an unforgettable stay cay experience.   I had a complimentary upgrade to the twin tower view room and was automatically given a hard contour pillow without asking for one. The team does put an effort in viewing their clients profile by providing a true Malaysian hospitality. I feel like this has been my many stays but in fact it was my first."
Kudos to reservation executive Darren Cooray whom has personally emailed his early birthday wish to me and also informing that they will prepare birthday amenities for my room. I wasnt expecting much but really touched to see the efforts by the Traders team. Check in & check out process was swift. The concierge team especially those who are manning the buggy services are really cheerful and helpful . The Skybar is a must if you are staying here especially at night as the view is amazing. Will definitely come back to Traders and hopefully will get room with the Twin Towers view next time.
"I would like to say thank you to Rachel at reception, excellent service and very friendly. Club lounge offer amazing Twin Tower view.  Room is clean with sanitizer provided. All requests were responded quickly, truly enjoy staycation with early xheck in and late check out."
Awesome experience for kids as this is our first staycation in KL. The room are clean and spacious with KLCC view from our room. The staffs are all friendly and helpful. Will come again very soon! Thanks!
"This is my first review. I’m doing this to appreciate Traders Hotel on their facilities and stay.  1. $$$  its not expensive at all if you booked directly thru Shangri-La website.   2. View and Facilities  Perfect view of KLCC, Comfortable work table and chair, spacious washroom with all the required facilities. Hot Water and Water pressure superb. Buggy Service to KLCC no waiting time. SkyBar  3. Staff Friendly Staff and she explain to me all the things there clearly. She did accommodate all my request also she checked with if i required late checkout.  Overall its perfect hotel. I will stay there again and will recommend others to stay there... Superb"
"Love all about the hotel,love the view of the twin tower..their staff is super helpful and they attend to our request very quickly.eventhough we arrive late and the pool slot is fully book but we still love the room and love the buffet breakfast.hope to stay in the hotel again soon."
"be aware that despite the Covid and the travel restriction, despite the cancellation of events in KL, Traders does not refund not even offer you a coupon to be use in the Shangri La chain of hotels. They just cancel your reservation without any consideration and no empathy. Disgusting practice that are entertained by their rude staff. Highly not recommended"
"We got the suite WITHOUT the view of Petronas twin towers, still perfect. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Walking distance to KLCC park and shopping malls like Suria KLCC and Pavilion. Not a good swimming pool though!"
"Pros: Efficient in room service, bath tub in room, sky bar, view from the lobby and the pool area  Cons: Food taste can be improved. The Japanese breakfast was not bad just the char kuey teow not so nice."
Stayed in Deluxe Twin Towers View for the weekend. Bathroom ventilation not so good. But everyhing else is excellent. Staff were all very friendly & attentive. Room was very clean & tidy. Breakfast was so good! Need to make orders & the food will be sent to your table. View was top notch!
"It’S Wonderful Stay And Amazing View Klcc.. Traders Hotel It’s The Best Choice From Others Hotel Near Klcc.. Very beautiful night to see from room…like it very much. Easy Check in and FOC parking for Guest Traders Hotel. Can be Relax and Honeymoon or anything you want… Great location in Kuala Lumpur, Excellent stay and everything else.."
We just encountered the worst customer experience here. Will be our first and last stay. EQ and Ruma are so much better than this. There’s so much choices around the city please just avoid this one!!!
"Overall rhe staying experience was great and comfortable.They provided personal hygiene kit for every new check in but it is not being replaced although I stayed for 5 nights. However, mask is available at concierge. Hospitality was lovely and wish to stay here again for my subsequent trips. Shall try their SkyBar with great view of klcc. Swimming pool and gym facilities are open and available."
We stayed here for 2 nights  in the tower suite. Overall our experience was ok - not exactly what we expected given it was a Shangri-La property. Service levels were ok but F&B service quality leaves much to be desired and is definitely not up to Shangri-La standards we are used to.   What we liked:  1. Room views were spectacular - the twin towers were beautiful from our room 2. Location is fantastic - right next to KLCC park  3. Buggy service to KLCC was very convenient  4. Excellent service from reception staff - they were unable to send the concierge to get me painkillers but she took the initiative to offer her own painkillers and asked if I was ok with it - lovely  5. Attentive Traders Club staff   What needs improvement  1.  F&B service levels are not up to the standard
I decided to write a new review because I've been in that hotel like 8 times already and always it was great. Location is fantastic with awesome views from the room with twin towers infront. Staff is great and rooms are big and bed very comfortable. Always I'm in a corner room in high floor that offers you a great view. Wanna express my consistance in their great service.
This was a very very beautiful hotel located centrally and had a lot of interesting places around. Our room was right opp to Twin towers and had real big windows that offered a mind blowing view at the night.  There was a bar on the terrace that served good drinks. We had a great time!
"We had the ""Towers view"" room, and you can not imagine how close you seem to be to the towers themselves. The view is just amazing and worth the extra money as you only normally visit once! The hotel itself is beautifully decorated, the staff are just amazing and friendly and always willing to help and provide advice. The food is varied and great quality, and if you dine in in the evening at all - the burger is a must (I know its a burger, but it is a good one)! They provide a complimentory shuttle to the towers if required (just along the edge of the park, not far, but appreciated due to the humidity and heat). I cannot fault this hotel, staff, location or anything. Once of the best hotels I have stayed in worldwide. Thank you!"
I want to express my special gratitude to all the staff and Ms Cherly and Mr Chad too the night duty manager who ensured my weeding anniversary celebration was ok even though had some major issues with the room at first..they made me feel very comfortable stay after a little disappointment at first.. Room 2333 view was simply awesome..but I just feel like the room look old and need some renovation to be done..5 star service from all the staff there..kudos to the team..
"On the recommendation of friends, my partner and I chose to stay at Traders in their Club Twin Towers room for our 3 nights in Kuala Lumpur. After first arriving at the hotel the check in procedure at the lounge was quick and efficient, and all staff throughout our stay were incredibly helpful. With the upgrade we utilised having breakfast in the lounge each day, and used it as a space to relax whilst waiting out the (frequent) rainstorms during our stay. The evening canapes and happy hour also meant we were able to enjoy some snacks and drinks before heading out for the evening. The view from our room was one of the most incredible of our holiday, being able to see the Petronas Towers lit up at night from the comfort of your own bed was spectacular, not forgetting of course"
"This is a fabulous hotel. The hotel itself is modern and clean and the staff are very friendly and the concierge so helpful (we had a little issue with our travel rep and the concierge went over and above to sort it) The facilities of the hotel are of the high standard you would expect. Breakfast is buffet style and choice after choice after choice... The hotel is situated in the KLCC park and is directly across from the Petronas Towers. You can walk there in five minutes through the park. Make sure you book a Petronas Towers view room. There is nothing better than just sitting after a day out and about and watching the sunset and ligts change over the tower, or watching the park during the day and looking at the stunning view, including the fountains. The Skybar is a must for"
We went for a vacation in KL and checked-in here. We were given the best room with the best view of the Petronas Twin Tower! Everything was clean! I have no issues at all. Thank you Traders Hotel you made our KL stay very memorable.
"The hotel had a wonderful view of the Petronas Towers. Reception staff were friendly and helpful.  On check in we were offered an upgrade to a corner suite for a small amount of money. (This might have been because the hotel was not very busy because of the Coronavirus). Our corner suite was spacious with incredible views, a large comfortable bed and well equipped bathroom. As we were tired we decided to eat in the hotel. The restaurant was almost empty but the service was extremely slow. When the food arrived it was cold and so we sent it back. When it came back again it was still not the standard we expected from a hotel of this class. Our impression of the hotel  was spoiled by the service in the restaurant. Breakfast had a wide selection of international food available. On"
"We stayed here for 3 days on our way to bali, this hotel is very nice,all the staff are friendly and courteous. Our room was fabulous with a view of the petronas towers and the park,couldn't have been better. The room was a good size with a large comfy bed. Couldn't fault it. Would definitely recommend and stay here again."
We stayed 3 nights at the end of Feb beginning March. Stayed on Club level with astounding view of Petronas Towers from our window. The service throughout was excellent by all staff. The care under current difficult health situation was great to see and experience. Food wonderful for breakfast and the meal we had at Gobi upstairs was also excellent. Would certainly recommend.
Modern hotel centrally located for sight seeing .  Very enjoyable 3 night stay in a Club executive room . Friendly and professional staff . Excellent service in the club lounge . Fantastic view of the towers from our club room which was spotlessly clean and modern and well worth the extra cost considering the daily complimentary 2 hour bar and snacks. A couple of things prevent me from giving the hotel 5/5 . The 'hot' options at breakfast were lukewarm at best and the food selection is geared more to Asian guests rather than Europeans. The air-con in our room was inefficient . However I would have no hesitation in staying at this hotel again and would highly recommend it . Top Tip   -  Use the Grab taxis (  equivalent of Uber )  for city travel . Rediculously cheap and friendly
"What an amazing hotel Traders is. Clean, friendly and everthing you want from a hotel. Upgraded to a room with a view of the Petronas towers which was amazing. Staff were brilliant and the breakfast was superb. We had our temperature taken every morning which as assuring under the  current Coronavirus outbreak. Hand sanatizers everywhere in the hotel. Locaiton was great, at the edge of a beautiful park and only a short walk from shops and restaurants. All in all, fantastic Hotel"
"Beautiful view of the twin towers, very helpful staff and warm welcome. Lovely spa, we had a couples massage and really enjoyed it. Location is excellent, walking distance to large shopping mall and easy access to public transportation. We definitely will stay again next time"
"The hotel is comfortable and clean and service is good. My favourite of all is the room, the bathroom and the views from room and Sky Bar. However this time round I found 2 things to be below expectations - the breakfast buffet and the leakage in the room which was quickly rectified but caused me to not be able to sleep the night before. I acknowledge this is a problem with wear and tear and wouldn't fault the hotel on this but the buffet breakfast left me disappointed. Food wasn't great and labels were unclear."
On our final full day staying at this hotel which is in a great location near Petronas towers. Very convenient for getting around and staff very helpful and friendly  We booked a room On the club floor which gives you access to a nice lounge for breakfast ( good variety) Snacks and soft drinks and cocktails 5 to 7 with a good variety of snacks and a wonderful separate menu to cater for my vegetarian diet. The staff are lovely and eager to please. There is monitoring of your body temperature  And plenty of hand gel to use  The rooms are well stocked with iron hairdryer tea and coffee facilities
"Spent a night here whilst travelling from Bangkok to Singapore.  Perfect.  Chose this hotel for the views of both the Petronas Towers and KLCC Park...I was not disappointed.  My Petronas Towers facing room was clean, comfortable, modern and the bathroom was spacious and very welcoming after 24hrs on trains.  Excellent service from door-to-door; the reception even organised a taxi to drop me off at my Singapore bus departure point.  Be sure to save room for the buffet breakfast...it'll set up any weary traveler for the day."
Stayed here for 2 nights before returning home. Traders is really well situated go for a tower room and see the amazing views of the Petronas towers. Also views of the park and the dancing fountains in the evening. The rooms are a good size and lovely and clean. Breakfast is good plenty of choice.  It’s within walking distance of KLCC mall they also provide a buggy service if you don’t want to walk.
"Screened by security at both entrance, friendly checked in by their staff with welcoming drinks. And of course very nice environment in the luxurious room and very great choices and varieties of breakfast menus. Only walking distance to KLCC and the park. Great choice."
"Employees RE ONLY INTERESETED IN REALLY HIGH VALUE CUSTOMERS. Normal club customers do not get any service. Out of red vine, no offer, beer selection without a IPA-no offer, no understanding. no knowledge. Poor service. Rooms without any service, better to stay at the cheapest alternative."
"Hotel arranged our car to and from the airport, which was added to the room charge.  When we arrived at reception for our three night stay, we were asked if we would like to upgrade our room.  The offer included breakfast, free cocktails and snacks between 5 and 7 in the evening, access to club lounge and a room with a view of the Petronas towers, all for MYR730.  I do not regret in any way, saying yes and accepting the upgrade. Our room was 2713 on the 27th floor, with a wonderful view of the towers and the park. There is a good sized pool on the 33 floor, next to the Sky bar. Buffet breakfast was excellent, everything that I could possibly want. There is an electric car, which takes guests from the hotel to the shopping centre (KLCC) just beneath the towers."
This is a good hotel and if I could I would give it 3.5 stars.  Our room had a great view but was a little dated. Breakfast was disappointing and pretty chaotic - the card system on the tables didn’t work as the over enthusiastic staff cleared your table the minute you left to get something else.....    We paid for a club room and in comparison to others we’ve used it was pretty disappointing in terms of drink choices and snacks.
Located next to KLCC  and walking distance to the Petronas Towers (you can use the free buggy if you dont want to walk).  Breakfast is so good with many different cuisines. Fills you up till dinner time.  They say its a 4 star but I would call it a 5 star.
"We recently staged for one night before heading to Borneo. The hotel is nice with large rooms ( we were lucky to have a view of Petronas towers). We had dinner in the hotel and the noodles were delicious. Not very busy (lack of Chinese tourists) Outside is a lovely park and you are very close to the KLCC mall. The shops are a mix of high end and street market blogged. In the mall is the subway station, we travelled from there to Batu caves (change at KL Central but very easy) for about 5 ringets (£1 at the time) return. No charge to get into the caves so watch out for tours that charge more. We are at Hakka, 5 minute walk and the food was delicious but service very quick.   The only negative was the sky bar. Fantastic views to the towers but there are booths at the window so"
"I stayed at the Traders Hotel for two nights on my way to Indonesia.  I had two adjoining rooms with my family on the 19th floor with spectacular views of the towers. Breakfast selection was good.  There were measures in place for the coronovirus and that was reassuring.  The location was excellent, joined to the KLCC park and close to the mall.  We managed to get to the top of the Petronas towers and enjoy the lake symphony show every evening."
"Visited 4 nights begin Feb on route to Australia during virus problem. The hotel was very good with precautions - taking temperature readings on entry to hotel, restaurant and bar pool. All restaurant staff wore masks and gloves. Felt reassured as much as could be.  We had a fabulous view of the Petronas Towers overlooking the park - well worth asking for Tower view rooms. The bedroom was clean and spacious - huge bed. We had a good breakfast with large range of choice. We ate out evenings so can’t judge meals. The pool on top floor was enclosed and usually had the windows open - great when a breeze but quite hot otherwise as fans were not always on. Nice view especially at night.  The location next to the park is also a great plus. You have a feeling of space and there are some"
"We stayed here for a two night stop over to see the sight of KL. Great locaiton and weould definatly recomend paying the extra for a towers view room.  Good breakfast but busy, restauraant food good but lacking atmosphere, good wine selection.  As all hotels you pay a little extra for the convenience.  Good size rooms, very cean and good location."
"Once again we chose Traders Hotel for our stay in Kuala Lumpur and, as usual, we thoroughly enjoyed it.   The staff are so lovely, especially Theresa Goh, the Director of Communications at the hotel: she’s a star, so helpful and professional, a great asset for any hotel group. Thank you! The hotel is also very health conscious at the moment with antiseptic gel provided everywhere, free body temperature checks and fantastic room cleaning. The gym has everything one needs and fantastic views too. We truly enjoyed using the running track in KLCC park as well, which is right in front of the hotel: step out and you are in the park! Couldn’t get any closer!   Of course the rooftop pool and open air Sky Bar are very famous features of this hotel too.  The breakfast buffet is incredibly"
"The hotel was very quiet because of the coronavirus outbreak but the service offered was excellent. The staff were courteous and went out of there way to be helpful i.e. given breakfast in a bag for an early flight out of Kuala Lumpur. The Skybar is also very atmospheric. If I returned to Kuala Lumpur, I would stay here again."
"We stayed here in our way back from Vietnam and it was a great way to end the holiday. We couldn’t get tickets for the Petronas but in fact we got a much better view from the hotel! The roof terrace and pool is the best place for sunset drinks.  The location is great, right in the middle of town, with excellent access to the malls and restaurants.  Everything was whst you expect from a hotel of this level- can’t fault it."
"My friends and I stayed here for four nights. The staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast is buffet style with a large choice of eastern and western style foods. The hotel is a short walk away from the petronas towers, but also offers a complimentary buggy service, which helps. Our rooms were spacious and cleaned daily. There is a daily tourist tax of 10 riggit a night, and also they require a deposit returnable on check out."
"Pretty much the perfect hotel! Great location,rooms excellent,  great laundry service.  Breakfast  buffet has a huge range of food and last but not least the guys on the concierge desk, especially Badrul, were so helpful. They gave me so much information on where to and what to see,also booking a bus to Singapore for me, all done with charm and a big smile. Thank you Badrul! All in all a great stay and would not hesitate  to recommend."
"Hi, we were in KL for 6 nights out of which the first 4 days were at another hotel and the remaining last two nights were at Traders KL. The only reason for our change in hotel was for the view of the Petronas TWIN towers.  Though I wanted all 6 days to be at traders but since the cost was too high for a room with the view we decided to split the stay . And I am glad we did because though the room ( deluxe double room ) had the best view of the tower it didnt quite meet our expectations in terms of service .To start with room size was pretty small ( but that's the least of the problem) , I had called in for housekeeping and since I had come back from my trip early I was in the room while the cleaning was going on and I must say I was disappointed!!  There were tags that had"
"Last weekend I visited Kuala Lumpur with my Mom to enjoy a relaxing weekend from the stressful Jakarta. We booked a room for one night at Traders out of curiosity. When we arrived, a receptionist, Michelle Lee assisted us with the check-in process. The process was quick and thorough though she will be much more beautiful if she put on more smile. The room we stayed in I think was the most standard room with the city view (not the twin tower view). The room was great! The design is somewhat vintage and old but still has the luxury feel coming from it. At night, I visited SkyBar which is located in the hotel as well. The place has the best view I've ever seen in KL with the glimmering and shining Twin Tower as your scenery. In my opinion, this is the must visit place for"
"Stayed at this hotel just one night on route back to the Uk. Only hotel in KL with full frontal views of the Petronas Towers & offers dramatic city skyline views.  33rd floor open air roof top Sky Bar, a little odd that the swimming pool was squashed in the middle of it & some of the seating area around the bar, although the under cover, had got a little wet following a very heavy downpour. That said the views were awesome. Walking distance to the shopping mall & Petronas Towers complex either through a park or covered walkway that connects the conference centre facilities. The shopping mall holds mainly designer shops so don’t expect to find bargains here. Plenty of places to eat & drink if you want an alternative to eating at the hotel.  Easy access to the Petronas Towers from"
"A two week stay at Traders Hotel in KL was (again) very hard to fault. The location is perfect, close to the KLCC park and all the shopping that one could possibly want. For those ‘of an age’ or just plain lazy like me; there is a shuttle buggy that runs from the side door of the hotel to KLCC shopping centre from 0800 til late. The staff at this hotel are polite and efficient and certainly not overbearing. The front desk staff were all well informed and able to provide cogent information on the location of attractions and services around the hotel. The rooms are well equipped and, if I had to pick a fault, I would say the room lighting was less than perfect. A little dim for my personal preference, especially when working in the room. There is a standard range of TV"
"I stayed a total of 3 nights. Bed and pillows were comfy, room was clean. Although location is not as good as staying at Bukit bintang area, this hotel is directly connected to KLCC. Easy to get grab.   Breakfast spread is good and available from 6am to 10am in the morning."
"Stayed at Trader's Hotel for a day.  I will give 5 stars for it 's excellent location, friendly and timely service, and superb facilities.  However, upon booking, there was no indication at all that i'd be charged separately for the airport pickup and tranfer when we checked out.  Thought all along that this facility was part and parcel of the hotel's service. This hidden cost therefore marred an otherwise enjoyable experience."
"Really nice place for afternoon drinks, easy to get to and fabulous views from the Pool Area. Highly recommended when you have the time, especially in the evening. Little pricey for the drinks, but well worth it....., don’t  pass this place up. Check our the photo.......,"
Lovely stay at Traders Hotel Excellent location  Great services Concierge staff very helpful and friendly Housekeeping really good Opt for Twin tower view-Stunning views in the night  Use GRAB for taxis- lot cheaper to go around SURIA KLCC mall very close by for food  Hotel is very clean  Did not opt for BnB as bit on the pricey side  Would stay here again
"Twin towers room, fantastic views, day or night from lovely room, we had a club room and used the club lounge, well worth extra as free drink And snacks for 2 hours with great views. Pool is very nice and is perfect temperature. Service is impeccable and nothing is too much trouble. Ice machine on each floor  Only complaint was breakfast was a little ordinary, plenty of choice but a little lacking in taste and refinement."
"My husband always wanted to stay at this hotel for the view of the petronas towers. Upgraded room to ensure view of towers and the view did certainly not disappoint. Hotel facilities good, breakfast excellent choice, gym facilities excellent. Found the pool in the bar area a bit unusual and put us off using it. Tried the sky bar on one occasion but very loud and worried I may slip into the pool when walking around. We were looked after though and when my husband asked about sitting in a booth area with petronas towers view we were accommodated as there was availability. Ate at the Goba upstairs restaurant and food and service excellent. There is a shuttle bus to the mall under the towers but we walked through the park area generally. Would definitely revisit if back to KLCC."
