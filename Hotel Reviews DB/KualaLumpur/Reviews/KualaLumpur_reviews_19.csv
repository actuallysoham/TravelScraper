"Sorry your checkin service too bad. Need to wait almost 7 hour, but management didnt take any action. Your breakfast is salty and not value for money. People will come and they never repeat again. Sure"
"Stayed here for 3 weeks in a Thinker Studio - was clean, very modern and staff were very friendly. The breakfast buffet was fantastic in the mornings, and the hotel itself is very nice. There is a rooftop pool and area for sitting to lookout at the view of KL which was amazing! Good option if you are staying in KL and don't want a traditional hotel - it is sort of like an apartment. There is a microwave in the room and fridge, but if you want to do your own cooking then you have to reserve a space in the kitchen. It is also very good for offering laundry service - there are washing machines and dryers present. It is located near KL Gateway Mall which is good, but if you want to go out to eat then you have to travel - there aren't many places within walking distance. It is also"
"Komune Living was one of my best choices to stay in KL, because of the location, comfort and value. But my third time of visiting is very disappointing. FIRST ISSUE - we can't check-in through the self-check in system after the very long queue because our booking number has changed but not notified. Then, we need to queue and check-in again with the new number. SECOND ISSUE - As we checked in 10pm after a long hectic day of working, NO TOWELS ARE GIVEN and the room floor is not cleaned where water droplets and many hairs from previous tenant can be seen! We requested from the housekeeping twice and waited till midnight but they failed to deliver. As it was our long hectic day of working, you can imagine how we feel to sleep without bathing and with the room floor condition."
Our room were only made available for us at 8pm. Forcing us to wait endlessly in the line along with our baggage. The entrance door was locked from inside and we had to find an alternatives way to get into the hotel lobby without assistance from the staff. Insufficient parking forcing us to park our car along the driveway of the hotel. The breakfast was lacked in varieties and does not reflect any decent quality.
"Great room, fitting for the occasion. The 26 hour staycation package included breakfast for two, which was great. However, they need to do some serious improvements to their crowd dissipation/handling procedures. Upon arrival at the lobby for check-in in the afternoon, I was literally shocked to see an extremely crowded space. The small lobby resulted in close to no allowance for 'social distancing' at all. Only 2 front desk officers were at the reception to handle SO MANY customers, and only two self check in kiosks were available. The queues were long. It goes without saying that the facilities were also crowded.  Having promotion packages is good, but please be ready to handle the crowd that ensues. To check out, you also have to queue at the reception or use the kiosk, so"
"Comfortable beds and clean place, love the surroundings and design. But we didn't get fresh towels :/   Elevator was fast. Check-in check-out was at the machine so it really was a breeze. Can validate parking very quickly."
"I booked the 26 hours package room which included breakfast. I loved every bit of the experience. I just checked in and checked out using the machine, and then went up to my room straight. The room is practically a studio where it has all you need. It even has kitchenette should you feel like bringing portable stove. The only downside is there’s no bottled water in the room and the tv channels are boring."
"This place is relatively new, with co-living space, community kitchen, self-laundromat and all. Since we, mom & myself are here for just 2 days, didn't check-out the community spaces. The 2-bedroom we booked is compact and clean. Comfy mattress, water pressure sufficient.  The breakfast served is basic, non-Malaysian food except for the fried rice. It has salad, cereal, half-boiled eggs, veg, fried rice. Basic, no complains, unless one is expecting a Michelin-starred breakfast.  The downside, wifi. It is just  s.o.  s.l.o.w.  Maybe it's the area itself? Even my own data is slow, but was very fast when I did a speedtest when I in another part of town.   Check-in, hotel was fully booked the day we checked-in, self-check-in machine can't locate our booking, so joined another long"
"During the booking through agoda, i miss clicked the number of occupants at 1 person instead of 2. I tried to get in touch through email and on check in day itself before my stay and during check in to change the number of occupants in the room so 2 of us could be allowed into the breakfast spread. The staff at check in just said breakfast will be provided according to the room number so i just left it at that. During breakfast, i was told only 1 person could enter. Poor communication and feedback from the hotel before and during check in really ruined the stay for us."
"Couldn’t sleep well due to warm air cond . Asked for maintenance help after the first night , unfortunately it happen the same on 2nd night . Dissatisfied. Reception couldn’t provide 2nd room key unless with proof of 2nd ic. I don’t get the logic of it. With single key , I believe no restrictions of bringing another friend /family , isn’t ?"
The room is clean and the bed is comfortable. Breakfast value and quality have improved. The location is great and closed to mid valley and other eatery area. But the thicker two room working table is quite small.
"Everything is good, except for one small detail. You have provided the kettle and water dispenser facility, but together with packets of tea, coffee and sugar sachets would be great. I would have given 5 stars.."
Everything was great. The view also nice. The staff very helpful every each section. Water is unlimited refill can keep hydrated. The pool very nice. Free parking. And I will repeat my booking to choose more bigger room size.
"This round, got a room assigned on a high floor due to room category booking availability. There were lots of noise even on a supposedly high and quiet floor - ranging from door opening & slamming, people movement, noisy chats & laughs, neighboring rooms' bathroom noises - and these continued up until 3-4am if I can recall while trying to get some sleep.  Additionally and as given a feedback o this before, the aircon was sickly locked at 31 deg C which is not an acceptable hospitality standard, and this was even way higher than our normal room temperature. It took 6-7hours to even reach 27 dec C and couldn't be adjusted further. This is once again unacceptable as it is an enclose area and 27-31 deg C is not fit for guests and will cause unnecessary suffocation/heatstroke."
"I love the modern design and the tv. Pillow so comfy. Everytime I want to staycation, i will find modern hotel and have so many channel to watch. They have smart tv, and great view too. Water flow was good even the toilet smelly sometimes dont know where come from. They dont have free minerals water and no free coffee or tea but they give u water heater and jug to refill. During mco we cant dine in for breakfast. So the menu so limited. Parking is free, lift no problem. Self check in, very fast.. Will come again if u give me best room like before.. Yeah! Thanks"
"While generally the stay this round was pleasant, but again and again to address hospitality standards and readiness/fitness to stay or to serve guests.  Found the television cable was unplugged and not displaying anything at all per the usual welcoming hospitality standards, while the telephone was faulty to a point that the line was too noisy and trying to get a message across to the reception was a hassle when the noise was overwhelming."
I love the concept of it. Well kept place. Rewarding time with friends even though confined indoors. There's different activities to toy around with. People shouldn't expect it to be the same ol hotel. It was a nice stay. We even planned out to move in together.
"Booking at the Komune original page is MUCH EXPENSIVE than booking through TRIP.COM (sort of being cheated to book at the original page)  Ok, arrive on New Year Eve 10.00 pm as check in is 31/12/2020  Security team very bad and lack of manners, lack of planning and not enough car parks then scold customers, initially ask people find car park around and just park. Then after park, ask people to leave.  At lobby, too many people, super long queue to queue for check-in and queue for lift to room.  Room although city view but really no view except view the other tall building blocking all views  Room showed got microwave oven but don't have.  Check out from room, waited lift for 30 minutes still full (just too many people), have to CLIMB STAIRS down to lobby from 27th FLOOR!  After"
"Booked a 3D2N stay in a Dreamer Studio. Room was a bit small but comfortable enough for two. Facilities were good and well maintained, was impressed by their game room. Pool had a fantastic view, just make sure to book a slot in advance for a swim. Convenient location, 5-10 minute walk to KL Gateway and Universiti LRT station, which meant easy access to nearby shopping malls. Nice place for a short getaway.  Things they can consider improving: - Had 5 functioning lifts but extremely long waiting times, after waiting for 30 minutes, we took the stairs from the 21st floor to the lobby WITH our luggage. - Breakfast spread was extremely limited, understandable given the pandemic season but quality of limited dishes was fairly disappointing. - Only 2 self check in kiosks and 3 staff"
"Location: Located at Bangsar South/ Kerichi. Away from downtown KL but near to Mid Valley Megamall and Universiti LRT Station (Putra Line). Parking lot available but quite hidden. Alot of construction still going on in this area.   Room 1910: Clean and comfy bed. Studio with only a kitchen sink and lots of kitchen space but empty. No microwave or even a single plates but only a sink! Small room but sufficient for only a night stay. Tea/coffee not provided, can refill your water at common area. Bathroom not clean and lots of hairs on the floor.   Facilities: Rooftop infinity pool was great but remember to make a reservation! Free carpark for guest.  Service: Self check in and out at the kiosk at hotel lobby which is quite convenient.   Tip: Not wise to check out around 12pm as"
"My stay at the hotel was good however, there were no coffee/tea sachets provided in the room. Besides that, one of the toilet floor trap was clogged. Should have provided slippers for the guests to wear in the room."
"Excellent hotel, great customer service from the reception, fast check- in services, each time my friends and i called for extra requests they were done perfectly and promptly. Beautiful rooms , had booked two rooms and the room for 4 pax was gorgeous! i dont know which words to describe it. very clean . excellent . should be rated five star. Breakfast was the icing on the cake. super good, excellent service from the entire service crew. generous serving on the buffet . my only request please add coffee and sugar satchets in the rooms atlist guests can make something at night or in the morning.i will definately come back any day any time. Thanks Komune living"
"Overall experience is good, great room, nice and cozy place to stay, the parking also free, what you need to do is before you go out bring the parking ticket to the receptionist for validation.  The breakfast for RM20/head is not worth it of what they served, Roti, Nasi Lemak, Coffee, coco crunch.   I Love the sliding door concept to demarcate the living and bedroom."
"Stay here so many times. This time in room 1818. The floor near the fridge was wet all the time possibly from below the fridge. The rest was just as expected; cosy, quite and value for money. May the construction in front of the hotel completed soon. It was mess."
"A good affordable staycation hotel for those who are searching for a place to stay to unwind their stress. My family and I stayed a Thinker Two last weekend. Though a bit small, the room was actually very cosy and comfortable. Breakfast was delicious! Would definitely come again to try your infinity pool."
"This hotel offers a variety of options from thinker studio, dreamer pad and others.For two months, I stayed in thinker studio which is a cosy and comfortable space for one person to live in. The views are quite nice from my room, be it facing TM tower or facing Novum condo, there is a large window where you can enjoy the city views day and night. The studio suite has a comfortable super single bed, a pantry and fridge where you can prepare simple meals, Smart TV and hot shower. There is a rooftop swimming pool, lookout deck and gym at level 29, however due to CMCO was not able to enjoy the swimming facilities. The front desk service will be a hit and miss, most of the times they are very nice, occasionally you will meet one that is unfriendly. I am very pleased with the services"
"Arrived at 1050pm on 07/11/2020  with my wife and kid at this hotel. I noticed that there was Receptionist stand by at the counter however they have practice to do check in by KIOSK machine which i did ask the GRUMPY woman (WHICH IS THE RECEPTIONIST) by not handling me professionally , yet, she showed me her sour face and unhelpful behavior when i asked her to guide me on how to do check in by using the KIOSK machine by acting sigh in front of me. I couldn't get her name because she didn't wear a name tag, but you can check CCTV for me like how she handle and assist her guest, NOT ONLY SITTING AT THE COUNTER BY DOING NOTHING!!!!!!!  for me this is unprofessional behavior as hotelier. Without her assistance, me and my wife were struggling check in by ourselves and we got it to"
"This trip was a downer after having stayed several times at this property,   1. ""Contactless"" check-in process which still requires us to go to the counter to obtain room keycards (what happened to the kiosk issuance?)  2. Inroom aircon settings were locked and tapering at 27-28 deg C for about an hour plus which in any case can suffocate esp in enclosed rooms (having worked in the hospitality industry, this setting is not acceptable as it can cause health hazards leading to suffocation)  3. What a ""welcoming"" bad stench from the drainage (in any hospitality-related properties, rooms ought to be inspected and sanitised properly before releasing them as 'fit to stay')  Additional checks on the room details showed several corners not dusted nor cleaned thoroughly. One unexpected"
"The price is cheap compared to other hotels, and the hotel facilities are nice. Infinity pool, game room, laundromat and etc are available to use. Breakfast was good as well, even tho less choices. The staffs are friendly as well. Only one thing I don’t like is the temperature of water during shower is not stable😅overall is a nice hotel"
"suprised that it was a decent stay.never heard of this place. stayed in room 2601. little disappointed when i used the toilet as there was stain in toilet bowl and being a woman i know what it is. but it needed some flush and i thought that was that. However, there was also slight stain on the white sheet. Super upset but since i was staying alone and for few hours ,i didnt want to dwell too much. apart from this i thought everything was decent."
"Overall place is okay, many facilities to use. Unfortunately you actually could have a convenience store inside the building for the guest. Also the room had bad smell that wont go away even after one night of stay"
"Highly recommended, great place for family to stay, excellent customer experience and for being very helpful and kind. Great location, and close to the city centre. Will definitely come back. : D :D :D"
"I am truly impressed by the front desk. Due to unfortunate circumstances, I had to shorten my stay. And when I consulted the desk, Shahrizan especially  helped me with the refund policies and even went above and beyond to follow through. Furthermore the location is utterly strategic. Will head back there soon."
"Was here for a staycation for 1 night. Had the privilege of using their October babies promo so extra discount there. I opted the Thinker Studio (super single)  Pros: - Room was extremely CLEANN, guess it's also because it's a new property. There was a microwave, fridge, water jug (there is a water filling station near the lifts), and a stool (not the greatest if you intend to work in the room) - Went to check out the co-spaces (kitchen, game room, alfresco, laundro) and it looked really organised and clean, not crowded either. Each room has it's own thermometer scan + MySejahtera app to scan. Didn't actually use any of the facilities tho - Has an infinity pool! - very comfy bed (it's firm but not rock solid), good for those with back issues  Cons: - Customer service could"
"Great place to stay, friendly staff and very clean! Thanks to Mr Indra for providing excellent customer experience and for being very helpful and kind! Great location, and close to the city centre. Will definitely come back!"
"Good serving for F&B, very appreciated for those staff in restaurant,keep it on!!! Really thankful for the Housekeeping who incharge lvl 9,the staff was so friendly and good greetings. Bad experience and disappointed for Front Office, two time check in and I gain poker face and not friendly attitude from the staff, need to be more polite and be patient when I asking questions. Hope to see any changes in the future."
"The room wasn’t spacious at all but was clean and comfortable. Breakfast buffet was provided, not that I’m complaining but the choices was somehow limited and have room for improvement. It would be brilliant if local foods and drinks were served too. However, I truly appreciate their 26 hours staycation package as a late riser and I’m more than willing to visit them again in future😬😬"
"Let’s start with constructive feedback, Good points: Great locations ( walking distance to kl gateway, sphere, lrt), comfortable rooms especially bed and linen, great facilities (game rooms, swimming pool), affordable for both short term and long stay. Limitations: Wifi connection ( slow connection especially for thinker two, Wifi users are limited to 3 devices for thinker two (in which it suppose to accomodate 4 guests), Breakfast can be hectic especially during weekend (suggestion: when hotel is expected to be full, then allow guest for takeaway breakfast to avoid disappointment)   Overall: Great place to stay for staycation or long term. Will come back in the future"
"Firstly the room is very small for 4. I booked a Thinker Two room. The floor isnt properly clean..can feel the dust. Soap dispenser is not working properly but they attend to it very well. I like the experience of self check in n check out. Air conditioning isnt cold enough. Tv channel selection is limited. No netflix. Wifi is very bad even tho its just right infront of TM tower! Even my maxis line also bad. Breakfast is so so..i dont expect much from breakfast selections. Customer experience is 3/5. Not great and not bad either.  Plus point - bed is comfortable, game room, swimming pool and other facilities is great. Price is great (promotion period), deco is nice and modern. Location is good and ample parking. (Free parking only for 1 guest car)."
"The welcome note onscreen was addressing another person. Wondering if the system was dysfunctional or not updated. Fr check-in to check-out, it was still addressing another person.  While the kiosk for check-in/check-out facilities are welcoming, there weren't any details on check-in/check-out time on the chits esp those that tie to TA's additional gifts/privileges that I had to call to enquire instead.  Other than that, overall stay was pleasant, and great common facilities on level 2. Just disappointed to know that no co-meet/co-work spaces in Malaysia that operates after 6pm. With the present situations, many are no longer following 9-6 kind of work/meeting time, would be good to consider extending the access and use of the co-meet/co-work spaces after 6pm."
The overall is ok.  My honest complaints/feedbacks: 1.  The checkin process was not smooth. I was lined up at the reception for couple of minutes to check-in. When I reached my turn the receptionist asked for my booking number and asked me to self-checkin at the kiosk and I’d to que again. I don’t know why he can’t just check me in at the counter since I already queued for quite some times. Or someone can just tell me to check-in at the kiosk earlier.   2. The lift was a nightmare. Even though there are 6 lifts in the building I’d to wait around 15-20 minutes to get a lift from level 20. I even heard some of the guests had to take the stairs because they have waited for too long.   3. Clog in the shower and they didn’t provide dustbin other than just one small dustbin in the
My 3rd stay with Komune for staycation as it was quiet and convenient. Friendly service and clean room as usual.   This stay was quite disappointing with screaming kids along corridors and guests squeezing into lift without observing SOPs. Called receptionist twice to manage room above me as the children were screaming and jumping during bed time. Receptionist were helpful and the noise stops after my second call.   May need to reconsider the stay if you are looking for quiet staycation during weekend/ school holidays.
"Location of the Hotel is very strategic, several malls & restaurants located nearby (KL Gateway, Nexus) But you can also get a taste of some local food nearby the many stalls in Pantai Dalam (Cheap & Delicious!). The hotel itself is very nice, compact/  comfortable rooms, and was also lucky enough to get one with a view of the city!   Plus points of the hotel are the infinity swimming pool and the viewing deck on the 29th floor which gives you a clearer view of the city and the common area + cool  game/lounge area. Staffs were nice and warm!   Options on the Smart TV can be improved. The Netflix app was not available and the channels available were limited. The elevators also took a couple of minutes before arriving. I was staying on a weekday so the waiting time was not too"
The hotel has very good services and the staffs are all very helpful and very considerate. I accidentally had to check out late and the staffs did not ask for additional charge. Secondly the hotel also adheres to SOP as when I had lost my mask they give one for free instead of incurring additional charge
"Worst customer service ever especially the reservations department.  Not only that, they also commit a false advertisement or misleading information in their offer and charge me more than the price that they include in their ""so-called-invoice"". I'm gonna make a police report for that.   If you guys want to stay at this place make sure that you dont book direct from their website, because they will charge you more plus the customer service quality is worst, they are not helpful at all."
My friends and i stay here over the weekend for a city staycation.  Good: - Room is compact but pretty nice - Great hotel to take OOTD / Instagram - Polite staffs - Smart TV is pretty ok. Got a few watchable channels. Strongly recommend people bringing their hdmi cable to stream tho.  Bad - Parking is limited. People resort into illegal parking outside causing congestion. - Check in a hassle. There is a machine but sometimes it didn't work. Reception is not helpful so they just direct us to (broken machine). So we gotta line up like twice. - Breakfast is pretty bad lol. Like seriously lol i suggest people order grabfood. Line is super long too (but its due to mco so understandable). Breakfast not worth lining up an hour tho. - Overpacked hotel especially on weekend. Good luck
"My 4th time here. Last trip I brought my family. Booked a room for 3 adults 2 children below 5. Room has queen size bed and sofa bed. This is why I said this place can't accommodate large number of guests staying there.  - no extra pillows for the sofa bed.no extra blanket or towels. Towel still for only 2pax. So I decided to book another so tht my niece and nephew can be comfortable.  - wifi not working (so you'll say just call the reception and ask them! Well....  - called the reception many times, no one answered. (then you'll say.  Go down and complain! Well... - lift was extremely slow. Cause the lift to the room is also the lift to the carpark. Thus waiting for the lift really a waste of time when it's full house. Was at the swimming on the 29th, we then decided to use the"
"This is my 2nd time stay at the hotel. We had a lot of fun at 1st level, play snooker, video games and many more. Breakfast is limited but all ok and follow SOP. Pool is nice (have to book ealier). I would appreciate if there's a coffee & tea in the room. Iron at laundry room, 1st level. Thanks."
"Was there for 3 nights stay # Thinker Room - all was good, comfortable stay, kiosk for checking in checking out was a breeze with room keys key drop by kiosk, breakfast was simple and nice, room was cozy with city view, basically nothing more to say except the staff were all Fabulous and very accommodating helpful and made my stay more pleasant...Will surely be back and highly recommended place in Bangsar South. Well Done..!!"
"Tried booking via the hotel's website (the website has better deals than OTAs) and it was unsuccessful after many attempts, rang up the hotel for assistance and was disappointed with the service. Proceeded to book via Agoda instead.   Parking is rather limited. Check in was pretty smooth. Some of the front desk staff could ease up a little. Rooms is decently sized. Bed and pillows are good. Room amenities are lacking, there's no toothbrush provided and toiletries are way below the bare minimum. The TV lacks alot of function for a ""Smart TV"". Breakfast spread provided was decent enough for the price and the food was alright. Service at the F&B joint was great. Housekeeping does a great job too.   Overall this is a good spot if you need somewhere to crash for the night."
"It was great experience but room wise quite small, lack of kitchen amenities (I thought it was complete studio). No microwave but there were few cups. Remember to bring toothbrush and toothpaste as they don't provide any of these facilities. There is no mineral water in room. It is clean and cozy. Just that the space is quite small for me.   The staff are super nice. From counter to restaurants. Helpful and always smile. On last day, building aircond is haywire, but the staffs handle it well. Although you can see their stress level as they cant give any definite answer. Anyway thank you for still entertaining us calmly at 3am."
this is my first visit.  the security guard also very helpful. he follow the sop and taking guest body temperature before entering the parking.  i am very happy for the excellent front counter service especially the boy that assist me for check in.   the hotel room is very clean & they provide free wife. its easy for me to do my work. the bed is comfortable and i have a good rest here. definitely value for money.  more important this place near by rtm angkasapuri.   i sure will come back in the future.
"First time stayed and check in via kiosk, check in process is fast. provide free parking, have nice infinity pool view and look out point, enjoying the city view from here. provide comfortable mattress and sleep tight, provide simple and healthy breakfast. Definitely will visit again.."
"I visited this hotel for 6-7times even I live nearby and i will definitely come again. I love this place as the ambience, the place, the room and the staff meet my expectations or beyond. I have never stayed to hotels more than 2 times, but this, meet my taste!"
second time stayed here..love the place and the concepts.. just need to improved on the breakfast as due to MCO..maybe can add in simple fried rice.. and provide mineral water in each room would be great 😁 definately shall repeat again to stay here...
"For the price that they offer. It is a fantastic hotel with fridge, microwave included. Breakfast was pre-packed and I wish the portion could be bigger  The room was good. You'll need to bring your own toilet amenities.  It was pity during my stay, the infinity pool and game room was still closed. Only 1 parking is available for each room.  Self check in and out kiosk was good too."
"This is probably the worst hotel that I have ever checked into in my life. The service is so bad. I have seen better customer service in third world countries without electricity. The Komune Staff are all lazy and are careless. I don't know how the hell they attract customers because they don't even care about their damned jobs.  they didn't clean well and they will ask your deposit although they don't their responsibility at all.  if you want to argue about this and their service, go to Komune hotel."
"The room was super dirty. I called the receptionist and spoke to Ken/Kent to arrange for a housekeeping, he promised the cleaner will be there within 30mins but ended up the housekeeper did not show up at all. I went out for dinner and came back quite late, since i only booked for a night hence i dont bother to call the receptionist and arrange for a housekeeper again that night. It was however a really frustrating experience."
"The hotel really beautiful and all the facilities are new and advance. Check-in/out so easy using kiosk at the lobby. Ironing & cloth cleaning need to go to Level 1. Water station at each level. I stayed in 2 bedroom with 2 large bed for RM200 including breakfast. Worth the money. Room are clean and the interior are well designed. Even the room is small, it feels big. Definitely stay at this hotel again. LOVE 3x...!!! Thank you Komune Living!"
"I've stayed at Komune twice and both times they gave me the wrong room type during check-in when I booked for another type of room or requested a specific bed configuration. While the staff were generally pleasant, it was just unnecessarily inconvenient and annoying because the check-in process takes up so much time before I can finally enjoy the room.  Apart from that, everything else was commendable. The room was very clean and comfortable. Room facilities were good, although I expected to be supplied with a few complimentary coffee/tea sachets since coffee/tea making facility were provided (not that big a deal, but would have been nice for the price and standard of such accommodation). The beds were comfortable, enough towels provided, good water pressure in the clean"
"Arrived at Komune at 6pm expecting that I'll be enjoying my 26 Hours Staycation that I booked on their website (as advertised online)  only to find out that I have to check out at 11am the next day. Apparently, they cancelled my booking without notifying me because on the email I sent them, I stated that I want to cancel in case it's not for 26 hours.   Take note that I called their hotline an hour after I made the booking to confirm if it's for 26 hours just to be sure I won't encounter any issues and the person I spoke with confirmed it. That's why I didn't expect it to be cancelled hehe.   So to cut the long story short, had a bit of discussion at the front desk and they eventually let us in after an hour. Situation was handled professionally by Irma and Indra (kudos!) and"
"I’m staying for only a one night and the staying was superb and fantastic experiences. However, i can’t really accept the services from the front desk officer, which is not friendly and polite. Overall rate of room and the hotel is very good. Even at night they play the song at the lobby quite higher until when you need to talk with them you need to ask the question twice. Please make up the on the front desk. The best services from the front desk can make people put a bad experience at the hotel."
"staying here for 1 night   room - small, clean, comfortable and reasonable for the price. wish they had provided more than 2 pillows (at least extra small pillows), no basic toiletries except for shower gel and shampoo. toilet door cannot be properly closed and there is no lock. tv channels only basic tv are provided, no netflix/hbo etc. aircond not cooling (arrived late at night, lazy to complain).   breakfast is a major let-down. price mentioned breakfast inclduded but did not specify how the breakfast going to be (but for the price i did not expect anything fancy). during mco, there was no buffet. a person entitled to only 1 meal. it is wiser for the management at least provide guests options of menu to pick from. as most your geusts now are local, why did you pick a western"
"I have a pleasant stayed at Komune Living but the staff name Atikah, who worked on 12 June 20, PM shift is quite rude and she is not suitable work as a Receptionist or any field related to customer service. To maintain the great service, I suggest to put someone who have a very good soft skills and very helpful especially when the customer in needs."
"I was happy to stay at this hotel with perfect facilities, perfect location, friendly staff, and many more! It is my favourite hotel to stay from now on if I come to Kuala Lumpur.The parking fee is free too."
"This is the best hotel I ever stay in. ❤️ Trendy and comfort. Stay most liked the feelings of home. I like the interior design👍🏻👍🏻 Most important very affordable price with 5 stars facilities. 👍🏻⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  The thing that dissatisfies me most is the parking charge. 😂😂 I stayed for one night. 2pax per room. The parking fee turned out to be RM34. I was scared.  I didn't expect a one-night , visitor need to pay a slightly expensive parking fee. But thankfully, the parking fee for the first visitor is free.  Hope that the management can correct the above problems  Thank you 😊"
"Very happy with the facilities and staff in this place. I stayed for a long time and found this to be the best option in this category. The gym is nice, swimming pool is awesome. The rooms are not very spacious but enough."
"Under the Covid-19 pandemic, hotel has put in their effort in following the SOP sets by government, i.e. disinfection, sanitation and taking temperature of each guest. Sanitizer provided in the common area, comply social distancing in the lift car etc. The room is just nice for 2 adults, it is really good thought with kitchenette in the room as, we could not hang out much under the current circumstances, this allow us to have our own meal in the room. The lacing part will be the study/working area is too small, but we supposed, if we needed more study/ working area, then we would need to book a bigger room."
"It can be hard to locate the lobby entrance as the it’s kind of overlapped with another condominium.bur just follow the signs will do. Reception area is a fresh design and feeling welcome, and the hallway to the room floors are amazingly designed, which is a very good point. I took the think studio 2, which is one of the smallest room, the room size is adequate for travelling couple that doesn’t not have a lot luggage. But overall the room is feeling comfortable. And had to emphasize one more thing, they did a excellence soundproof material, so the night is very quiet and aid in recharging the body and get rid of the fatigue   Unfortunately we didn’t took any pictures"
"The room for 2 is very small, and one of the bed is slide out from other. No more space for us to move in the room. The hair dryer only available to borrow at reception. The common area are good enough, e.g, swimming pool, working space and lobby.  The room price include breakfast is very economy. We stay here for 4 night, there are different in everyday's breakfast."
"We stayed here for one night in March 2020. The hotel opened in 2019, so it's super new. The room still smell like fresh paint. The area around the hotel is going through a construction boom. but, we didn't hear any disturbing noise.  The room didn't have any amenities. I don't expect slippers, toothbrush from 3-star hotel, but at least basic stuff. They say to reduce plastic, they don't give complementary water. Okay, fine. We didn't have instant tea or coffee, sugar, only one box tissue in bathroom.  The bed, bathroom and other stuff in the room were clean. The WiFi in the room worked and as I tested you get 5 Mbps speed. The TV only has 9 local channels, nothing exciting.  Every floor has water station next to the lift. You can fill the provided bottle in the room to get"

"This is NOT A HOTEL. WIFi speed is 0. The purchased WiFi is poor too. Housekeeping has a lousy schedule list with them I. Which your room is not listed. Hence they will not clean. On one stay I had to scream over the phone ( after calling a few dozen times) and housekeeping came at 11pm! Every ask is multiple calls and you are lucky if anyone picks. Front staff are excellent in pretending to not hear the phone. Room will not be as advertised. Whatever they claim included is not included when you do check in. They have a lot of excuse such as ‘ you are short stay’.  Elevator takes forever. Send your kid to press and wait. You can then take your time and come and the elevator would still not have arrived. When it does arrive, it will be so crammed. Good luck breathing in all that"
"Service is good.  Hotel is very cosy and clean(Most Important) Less than 10 mins drive to mid valley And the hotel is only less than SGD70 for 3 nights.  Can see that hotel is still very new.   One bad thing is there is no food surrounding the hotel, not even a 7-11.  GrabFood is very common in this hotel."
"Check - in process is frustrating. Guest will walk to the FO desk then after they get the passport details, they will give you the booking ID to be key in the SELF CHECK - IN kiosk that isn't working properly, then you'll need to go back the FO desk to complete the check - in. Too much of a hassle!  Hotel is fairly new. The room is clean, minimalist, big and comfy bed, good location (near mrt). However, since this is a basic hotel, amenities like vanity kit is not available (will be requested to the the FO). even the blower needs to be borrowed at the FO desk. Internet keeps logging out - annoying. No water bottle in the room but glass and pitcher is available for refill in the dispenser near the lifts. Food is okay, very limited selection, but if you're not picky (given the"
Stayed for 2 nights  - room is Small (expected) - Sound proof is bad . Can hear traffic sound from highway . Also some noise from the train. Can hear neighbour taking shower  - toilet shower - water overflowing from shower area. Flood toilet - can hear Guards walkie talkie early in the morning at 5am-6am - not very clean room - local tv channels
We went on Saturday and saw a very long queue. Tried to do self check in but the machine did not allow for some reasons. Had to queue for a long time before we got our room. The room was superb! Clean and very modern. Breakfast was okay considering it was complimentary. Value for money!!!
"Suitable if want to have a short getaway in Bangsar South,KL with affordable rates.  Great co-sharing facilities if plan to stay longer.  Staying here gave apt/studio vibes.  Worth the money for tourist looking for a comfortable stay near to public transport as it is walking distance to LRT University/KL Gateway."
"New hotel. Room was superb with modern design. Enjoy the scenery at swimming pool located at the rooftop.   There are no basic amenities in the room such as tooth brush, tooth paste and shampoo. No bottle water and sachet coffee and tea. However guest can took hot and cold water at water dispenser at each floor.   Prayer room, games room, self service laundry, gym, and share kitchen available at level 1."
Excellent service... But for breakfast food need to change every day and put some varieties for main dish.. Plus also need to serve drink for kids like milo or chocolate drink.. The front liner are very helpfully and nice... Will repeat stay at komune living again..
"As we know the breakfast is complimentary by hotel and the most cheaper within other hotels but need Chef Komune to improved the menu. If everyday almost the same menu except main course like Nasi Lemak, Porridge, Mee Goreng etc. Need Chef to more variety of the menu. Last time Chef put Porridge and Mee Goreng as main course but both I'm not eat and i have no choice to eat Roti with butter only. Its not cheaper for the guest. Fruit also everyday same. For egg, can you do in last time do a Live Cooking and cook as per request. That is much better if others guest not eat for other menu, maybe can eat fried egg or scramble egg. And also its kids friendly. Sometimes i have no idea what to eat. I hope Komune can improve for the future."
"New, clean.  Reasonably priced with swimming pools & gym. Love the concept with kitchen place, laundry areas, working space. Excellent for business travellers. Less than 10mins walk to mall. Excellent location."
Without doubt excellent service from check in 4N stay to checkout. Small request was attended to promptly and efficiently. Daily housekeeping no worries👍🏻 but expect no frills to the price yet worth the stay. Definitely will be a booking for my next trip!  Keep excelling your service Komune😊
"Spent two nights at this hotel In February 2020.   Pro: good price, breakfast is good too especially considering how much it costs, water fountain in the hallway (no need for plastic water bottles), nice rooftop pool.  Cons: construction all around the hotel, some of the rooms will overlook construction sites; rooms are small; only local TV channels; small beds.  If you need a place to sleep for 1-2 nights and you are alone than its ok. I would not recommended for a family."
"We stayed for a month with our kids. Great option for a long term stay. Location has nearby upscale dining, fast food at the local mall (the mall itself is mostly dead but the Bangsar mall is a short drive away. Also note this isn't Bangsar, which isn't easy walk to as a big highway is in the way), as well as street food by the transit stop -- all within 5-10 min walk.  Rooms are small but clean and mostly functional. TV has local channels and Youtube, bathrooms have body wash and gel. The idea of the hotel is to spend time outside. To this end they have a game room with PS4, pool table, foosball, ping pong, and arcade with a bunch of Street Fighter games. Also has lounge areas, laundry facilities (for some reason they sell everything but detergent in the vending machines),"
"Newly opened hotel with new facilities and amenities.  Good location - accessible to a few shopping malls with walking distance as well as LRT. Hotel seems to offer reasonable monthly rate for a long term stay guests.  Hotel staff's service quality requires improvements, I feel. The way they respond to the customers' requests with rare smiles, and tone of voice - I have not been very impressed with their service during my stay since late October 2019. 3 star enough. Wifi in the room is very slow so can't hardly tell that wifi is included. Wifi speed at the lobby is okey. It's probably because there are less users for that one account in specific"
"I start being regular guest since 26 Dec 2019 till now. It's long time not drop a review in this sites. But this hotel make me trigered to write again. Check in process quite slow due to school holiday seasons . Feel sad to other guest which is family and group. Especially when I ask for city view compare construction view which might be noisy. That time self check in kiosk not yet functional. I found Receptionist already doing the best. For me this hotel should provide the waiting guest complimentry welcome drink or tid bits in restaurant. To avoid crowd in the lobby. Next, the room it's not big as showing in the official website. The online booking agent that I book showing 4 pillow instead of 2. What the modern hotel that not provide basic idea like energy plug on bed Head?!"
"1st in agoda only can select Queen bed but before payment in agoda actually can select twin beds or queen and I have selected twin. But upon check inI was told by friendly staff I only pay for queen size. In agoda wedsite but there's no upfront selection for twin bed selection however they upgrade the room to 2 bedrooms which is good and helpful as they guide us to check in at kiosk.my Friend and I are grateful for the assistance and upgrade with friendly staff.2nd I also got request for early check-in/out and high floor as it is my birthday and wanted to spend more time in hotel. but reception can't seem to provide details if we can do so on the same day of check in, I was told to go hotel to ask personally instead of over the phone. Aren't they supposed to know the updates"
"Pros: - the interior design is good - The room is clean  Cons: - Slow check in process - Bad customer service. The staff told us that the room we booked has fully occupied and give us a free upgrade room. Sounds good but the room upgraded to us has 1 queen bed and 1 sofa bed, instead of 2 queen beds room we booked. So, we requested to have extra pillow and blanket for sofa bed. In the end, we did not get it - No hair dryer. We checked with customer service. They said the hair dryer is out of stock.  - No toiletries. You have to prepare yourselves.  - There’s microwave in the room but no cutlery and plates provided - Spoilt electric kettle"
I stayed at the Hotel for only 1 night but I’ve tried all of the facilities that the hotel provided. Here’s my reviews that might help others traveler.   Check in - the check in process was smooth and the Front officers explain to me all of the facilities they have in the hotel. Everything was okay and I like it because it was really fast check in.   The room  - The room was really small. You need to book bigger room if you are a couples traveler or you travel with your family. Mine was is a queen bed size and it was really small but still okay for me because I’m alone.  - Please bring your own toiletries because they didn’t provide it for you. They only provide towels and shampoo. No mineral water or other aminities like you always seen in other hotels.  - They provide you with
"Although the room is small, it’s great for a night’s stay. Rooftop pool view is amazing, they have a 24hr gym. Breakfast had sufficient amount of choices, do come earlier to avoid long queueing. The game room was fun. There are vending machines  near the laundromat and co kitchen space. DO bring your own toiletries as they only provide one shower gel. Free parking. Staff were friendly."
"The overall experience was awesome and the concept really modern & clean.. I enjoyed playing ping pong and arcade game right after the countdown was over.. However, the reception there was not helpful. I queued to check in but they only inform me about the self check in kiosk after verifying my agoda confirmation id..the staff was slow and blur so it wasn't a good experience.."
"It's new, clean BUT it was not spacious as seen from photos. It's a 3 star hotel but it does not make you feel like a 3 star hotel. I had more than 5 bags to carry up to the room but i was told there's no staff to assist. Had to do it myself. I requested for 2 double bed, called and confirmed but when I checked in it was a different room given, the receptionist had the cheek to tell me it's subject to availability. Then I dont understand the reason I put it special request and called for what.. My sister requested for additional pillow but room service said is subject to availability. We had to go all the way to the reception and ask for it.  Asked for house cleaning but there wasnt any replenish of toilet rolls, tissue box nor did they change the towels. Breakfast suppose to"
"Spacious room, fine furnishing, great location which is near to Mid Valley Shopping centre and walking distance to Bangsar South and LRT station would definitely give credit to this new, young and stylist serviced apartment. Most importantly, they have sufficient amenities to keep my kids occupied during the 3 days stay. Strongly recommended. Nonetheless, I think there’s a need to improve on the customer service as I found that the front desk is always busy and things we request is not well responded on time."
"The room is slightly smaller than I've imagined. But that's alright it's still comfy. Overall concept of Komune Living is great.  Just a few comments, 1. The toilet bowl is dirty when I checked in. It's some stain in it that can't be flush away. 2. Called for Room Cleaning but no one show up after a day.  3. The front desk counter is a bit short handed. Only one stuff is there to serve the huge crowd.  4. Breakfast is a nightmare. Is so crowded and no places to seat. And once the food refill came back. It's very fast crowded with lots of hungry people once again. You can't even get a hand on the food if you don't force yourself in.  5. WiFi in the room is very slow.   Maybe it's because Holiday season? I don't know."
"Thanks for the comfort stay with strong wifi, gym & games room. Provide 3 multilevel parking lots. Just that the breakfast that we had on the nasi lemak sambal too salty & friend noodle tasteless. Would go back again in future"
"Overall, my family and I had a pleasant stay here. The facilities provided were all in a good condition especially in the game room. Although the games provided were quite limited but it was enough. The breakfast served was quite good as well but it will be nicer if we were given variety choices of food and beverages. The view near the swimming pool was stunning. Definitely the best plus point of the hotel. The room was on the smaller side but the interior is nice and comfy. I will definitely come again for another staycation."
"The rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet and the buffet breakfast is good.  Some slight negatives:  * The rooms are on the small side for anything other than a short term stay.  * The plugs power supply turns off when you exit the room which makes charging devises slightly annoying.  * The light by the mirrors in the bathroom is quite dim which makes it difficult to see to shave  * The washing machines and dryer token machines only accept cash and they do not sell tokens at reception. So for me this meant a trip out to try and find a cash machine and then having to get change for a small enough denomination for the machine. This is really annoying and something you should address asap."
"The concept of the hotel is fantastic. Being a newly opened hotel, there are rooms for improvement in term of the facilities, housekeeping of the rooms and service of the staff. But overall stay was good despite some small unpleasant instances during check-in. Keep it up to make the hotel's a better option for travellers."
"I had great time while staying at Komune Living. It's easy access from Univ LRT, shopping mall just next door so no to worry if you were hungry.Soon as I arrive, no need to queue up for checkin. just straight to the kiosk and do it yourself. Have a good time at games room and enjoy the stunning pool view, even at nights. I loved their breakfast, simple but tasty."
