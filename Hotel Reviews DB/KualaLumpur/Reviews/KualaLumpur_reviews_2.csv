"Wonderful ambience and decor. A relaxing stay in the city with 24 hour check-in policy, awesome food.. and don't forget to raid the complimentary minibar! Walking distance to Suria KLCC, Pavilion, and more!"
"This hotel was chosen in celebration of my wife's birthday and our anniversary, The reservation team did an exemplary job of assisting me through email and calls. Very attentive and detailed. As an interior designer, I'm impressed with the level of details that makes the entire hotel a poetic and aesthetically pleasing experience.   The receptionist greeted me as I was still approximately 4 feet away from the counter, her tone was friendly and genuine. I was briefed in detail about my stay and the facilities within the hotel and my room.   Special thanks to the butler team in the setup of the bedroom with flower petals and balloons to support my wife's birthday surprise. During the span of our stay, we were presented with cakes for our birthday and also apples with a welcome"
My room was upgraded to deluxe suite for free and I was surprised the hotel even decorate some balloons & dessert in my room. The parking is also free and all the mini bars are also freeee. But the main reason I chose this hotel is bcs they offer the 24hours check in & check  ! Major love for this hotel. Will visit again soon
"Had a fantastic time here- the flexi check in and check out was amazing, together with the complimentary minibar. Room was also really nice. Buffet Breakfast was only available on the weekend but it was quite delicious."
"A great place for a MCO-staycation because of the classy decor, perfect location in KL and a top notch service team. Check-in/out was a breeze and love the flexibility offered to set this hotel apart from the rest. In-hotel dining and buffet is also great."
Everything was perfect and professional..from entrance to the room all beyond my expectations...except the buffet breakfast food were i think need to upgrade...for eg: the coffee machine need to add as so many people queue to get their coffee.
Love this place and will definitely come back. Staff are friendly and hotel setting is beautifully curated. Best part is its easy access to the city centre & hotel rate is reasonable too. Planning to arrange a gathering with friends here soon!
"Our stay was made by 2 different booking with 2 night,  But when we check in and out need too keep telling reception staff our booking details.. Any our room corner studio is not clean at all at the corner side..little bit dusty üòÅ"
"I had a really pleasant stay with the ruma. They upgraded my room and provided flexi checkin/checkout which i ended up checking out late at night. Fikri from reception was very helpful & nice to me the entire stay. I wanted to extend my stay however it was a busy weekend, they were booked out. Sulaiman from housekeeping did a good job providing fast service as i requested some amenities. Breakfast in bed was superb especially now as i did not want to be around people at the restaurant. would definitely come again soon"
"I was at the Ruma on 10-11/4/2021 and I have booked a corner room for my weekend staycation. It was a splendid registration as I checked in early on 10/4 at 0030. Decoration is super glam! The frontdesk person greeted me  in Malay and I am definitely liking it!  The room, however.... There were corners especially at the bedside that were not cleaned, dusty. The pillows are light feather soft pillows. I dislike it because I did not get enough sleep from it. There is only 1 bin for a medium room. 1 small bin. The tub was just nice. It looks like everything cramps up in a small space.  The next morning I requested for a room make up. Little that I know, that I was DENIED to request room make up as I stay for 1 day only, and was advised not to request room make up on the last day of"
"Excellent staycation at the RuMa. Staff were excellent and friendly at every point in our stay. Rooms great with excellent lighting. Breakfast lovely as was the food and drinks at the pool bar. Great location, walking distance to Pavillion, Aquarium and KLCC Park.  We will definitely go back."
"Went here for a 1-night staycation and it was amazing. I would say their 24hr flexi check in/out time is what attracted me the most on top of other great facilities/services. I checked-in at 8am & checked-out at 11pm the next day (how crazy is that?! Haha I‚Äôm not sure if there is other place that offers this). The breakfast buffet offers quite wide variety western menu (eg. eggs benedict, raw salmon, big breakfast etc) on top of other basic breakfast buffet menu. The gym & swimming pool are great as well. The bar looks cool & its such a vibe to chill. Didn‚Äôt have a chance to try their other facilities like spa, meal room service or dinner restaurant but would recommend to try it out!"
"I have been liaising with The RuMa for a week in arranging a small birthday setup for my family member, and I have received really great support and service from the butler team. Special shoutout to Ms. Stephanie from the butler team for attending to all my requests patiently :)   Thank you so much The RuMa!"
"Room is cozy, with stunning KLCC view. So may plus points: 24 hour check in/out, daily amenities, friendly staff, spacious room. The architecture of the hotel - bringing history into a modern design is impressive. Overall, great experience and will def come back. Thank you The RuMa!"
"It is wonderful stepping into the hotel with it's tranquil walk into the beautiful lobby, it's an oasis in the middle of the city (strategically located about 10mins walk to KLCC and shorter stroll to Pavillion). Checking in was a breeze with friendly assistance. However, no one offered to take my bags up to my room (a single lady carrying 4 different bags) and they were not even really busy at the time i was checking in. But the excitement to see my room made me forget the strain on my shoulders. And what a sight it was walking to my corner studio, as the shutters automatically goes up while keep admiring the simple lines which are clean yet tasteful. i particularly big fan of the rose gold wash basin and the bath tub which i soaked myself every night.  Room came with a"
"If you're looking for a staycation, this is the best place to go as it is one of the best luxury hotels in KL at the moment. The price has dropped significantly because of Covid-19, so it is definitely worth checking the place out now."
"Excellent place for staycation, hotel offer late check out which exceeds my expectations. Staff were very helpful, check in was quick. Free drinks and snacks from minibar. We would certainly come back again!"
"If you are looking for a place where you can get away from the hustle and bustle of work stress, a place where you can enjoy some quiet time, enjoying a view, this is the place. One gets to enjoy the view of our iconic twin towers (ok, just one of the towers) and admire some state of the art homes and stays surrounding the area. Shopping and restaurants hopping are a stone throw away from the hotel."
totallly NO buffet breakfast.we provided menu in the room and they will send the food at your room.confirm the hotel your check out time before 48hours so u will entitled for flexi checkout(which i didnt received any emails about this information).small pool during covid only 6person at the same time.
Had a best birthday staycation at RuMa Hotel. Admin took my notes on booking to prepare room with birthday decoration & complimentary cake. Breakfast was served in room and we get to choose from menu set. The ultimate is the foc minibar!
"I made a reservation for my daughters birthday and made a late check in n some decoration arrangement. Everything was smoothly done and satisfying thanks to Mr Azel, ms Stephanie, Naeman & Ms Adreena. Definitely will comeback for my next stay."
"location: very near to the klcc park, bring your running shoes amenities: superb hotel staff : very nice interior design : excellent internet : excellent every room has nespresso machine and bath tub with a view"
Best stay experience I ever had at any hotel in Kuala Lumpur. Will repeat stay at THE RUMA and recommend to my friends and family. The staff is very friendly and will attend you happily without choosing the level of customer.
Excellent and give me good memories on my birthday. We hope to come again and hotel will provide another flexible check in and check out time which is very convenient and helpful to the customer like me with 5 kids.
It was a perfect staycation for my boyfriend and I. We literally did not want to leave the hotel at all with the full amenities in the hotel room. Highly recommend and I would definitely return soon again!
"It was our first time at the RuMa. Everything was beyond my expectation. Everything was great. It was a bit pricy but worth the money. My family enjoyed it very much and we will certainly come back next time. The best hotel in Kuala Lumpur so far. Congratulations The RuMa Hotel and staff, you guys made my day!"
"Enjoyed my stay here. Love their 24hours flexible check in and check out time. I do not have to rush back after breakfast session. There are still room for improvement here and there. Bedsheet was stained upon check in, but was changed quickly upon request. While having our breakfast at ATAS Restaurant, there wasn‚Äôt anyone to assist us initially, might be overwhelmed with the crowds, but everything was alright afterwards. Great stay!"
Decided to take my wife for her birthday at Atas Modern Malaysian Eatary. The food was 10/10 and better than that was the service. It was out of this world. Will definitely go back there again and would recommend it to all my family and friends. Kudos to the Team at Atas.
"Komalah from reservations was very helpful and so attentive in replying my emails. Eventhough it was last minute but she was so flexible in dealing with my request. From the first check in until the day i depart everything was awesome, Santai was so cozy and relaxing which i truly love it! The ird staff was super friendly and cheerful. I just love everything about this hotel. Wish to be back again! Thank you everyone for the great service. It was super awesome!"
"It was my first time dining at Atas Modern Malaysian Eatery at the Ruma hotel and all I can say is it was one of the most amazing time I‚Äôve had in a long time!  Great ambience and beautiful at every corner!  The food was great and the service was amazing!   Thank you to the Atas team, Bell, Adi and Deva and their manager for making my birthday a memorable one! Will definitely come back! Great food and even greater service"
"A very strategic location at golden triangle area, 5 minutes walk to Pavilion and other famous shopping center, staffs are friendly and polite, the room is clean and cozy. It is quite pity we did not have much time to visit the pool and spa, will definitely check in again!"
Clean and comfortable. My suggestion there must be an iron in the hotel room to all for stay at hotel especially for couples to honeymoon. Good service from staff. Nearest to KLCC. Delicious food and service.
"1. If you travel with kids, always go for Deluxe Suite for spacious room and 2 smart TV. 2. Again, go for Deluxe Suite if you care about the view. 3. Will be good if the front desk staff can call to remind on the evening canapes at SANTAI on LEVEL 6. May consider in-room dining as well (too crowded at pool area). 4. The number of snacks and drinks should be balanced. More drinks than snacks at the minibar during my stay. 5. Please let the guests know on room service hour. I made a call at 7am plus utilized the room service light, but only being attended at noon. 6. Overall, it was a pleasant stay."
"A Good experience for birthday celebration on hotel preparation, and my kids loved the hotel so much because is was so cozy & comfortable. will definitely return back for next time. thank you so much for the staff service."
"Booked a room  for my best friend and I to have some girl time before my big day -- Needless to say, we enjoyed our stay!  The hotel's location makes it extremely convenient. It takes literally less than 2 minutes to walk to KLCC, which means the LRT and MRT are equally nearby.   Everything was top-notch. Staff, ambiance, cleanliness, etc.   Based on the symphony of snores I woke up to in the morning, I can confidently say that the sleep quality was met with 5 stars.   Thank you RuMa, for the pleasant stay! We'll definitely be coming back again ;)"
"I stay with my family here. Its meet my expectation about 5 star hotel. The food and the service beyond my expectation. The most i like about this hotel we can check in early the morning and check out until late, not other hotel can offer. All the staff very friendly."
"Quality of property and aesthetics were high, the 24 hour check in indeed live to their promise (but no turndown service). But service during check in check out falls below expectation. Nobody brings you to your room either. Food service at the pool was lacking of staff. Really not what is expected of a 5 star hotel."
"very suitable for couple & we used as celebrate our anniversary, very good atmosphere, but 1 thing happened: i go out a while (maybe 2 hour) after finished check in, and maybe staff in hotel go in to my room as the time i come back the bed become messy. It is quite bad feeling."
"Have returned a few times, still feels like i am not in KL but i am actually here. The food is amazing at any time and location! Bed is super comfy! Everything is high quality top notch and yet the staffs make you feel at home and not some posh snobbish hotel.   Posh comfort!"
"Love everything about this hotel especially the Room or should we call it The Ruma. The amenities, the mini bar is top notch. But maybe can improve on the ATAS  buffet breakfast - not so many choices available."
"would definitely come back with my boyfriend again. Sooo comfy ! The room is clean, good smell, the whole ambient is good. Staffs all are friendly, location just walking distance to pavilion or klcc. And thank you theruma for the birthday surprise! :)"
Perfect for a staycation in the city!!I will definitely  come back for another staycation and celebration.The twin tower view is another plus point for The Ruma.And they are so generous by providing a complimentary mini bar to the guests.Kudos to all the teams.
"i stay here to surprise and celebrate my husband's birthday. i seek for the staff assistance at the very last minute, and they provide at their best to surprise my husband. you wont regret staying at the RuMa. everything is good and my kid also enjoying it staying here. strategic location, 3mins walking to KLCC park and pavilion mall. and definitely it's Instagrammable!"
"This is the best hotel I stayed in KL so far , their service is amazing ! The room is clean and beautiful , 24 hours fleck check in and out , free daily mini bar , their food is great . Their staff is so friendly and helpful  You are so comfortable which makes you feel like you in  home (Rumah)  Would definitely recommend ! And come back for sure"
"Superb rooms with luxurious comfy beds. Loved the amenities provided in room. Service was par excellent. We were gutted that the SPA was priced premium, and that the pool bar only offered ""happy hour' pricing. We really wanted to do more activities and spend more time and money inhouse rather than going out and risk infection during this period. Breakfast quality however was adequately just OK. I'd rate it 5/10. Nothing to shout about"
"MCO after MCO and with limited available rooms, we finally manage the secure our room in Ruma. My husband and I were impressed with the elegant design of the hotel and fast check-in. Only we wish that we can get a smile from the staffs, none till the end of our check-out time. Everyone seems so stressed out. Even the SOPs has been changed in Kuala Lumpur, we still have to eat our breakfast in our room instead of the restaurant. The food was great, but sadly it's turned out cold when it's arrived."
"Okay fine. Review this hotel yes? Okay. You see last week we were at the Ritz. Flex, flex yes. Wasn't too impressed. Paid double this rate. And so we come to this place. Whoa! Like seriously. Ok... attention to detail... yes! It's like an OCD person designed this room with comparments for spoon in the drawers and all. Yes yes. Good good. Complimentary drinks and snacks in the fridge? Yes... What?? Excellent!! High tech room with one click WiFi...!! yess!! usb charging ports!! yess!! HDMI and airplay and BT audio? are you kidding me? yess!! New nespresso way of making them coffee... Good! Good coffee! Reading chair? Thankss! We asked for baby chair and they came in and gave us chair, cot, potty, tub, and baby care pack!! whatttt?  Service is excellent, treats you like a king."
"Friendly and attentive staff. Gorgeous rooms and interiors. Great pillow selection. Nice dinner ambience at Atas, food is eclectic and tasty. A nice surprise even for a second time stay. Lives up to their LWH and Hostmanship values!"
"It has been my 8th or 9th time, I have lost count on how many times I have been there. Always good to be back, staff are always welcoming and its nice to be recognized by the staff when you are back. Anyway I just experience a slight hiccup when could not reach in room dining, even though I have call few times. Other than that, it has been a great stay like always. I would like to commend Front Desk staff Naiman for always recognizing me when I'm back and also In-room dining staff Aishah (mummy) always friendly service. I would like also to commend Santai and pool bar staff, I didn't catch his name."
"Feels like 'HOME' at The RuMa Hotel & Residence. Kami stay for 2d1n at Deluxe Suite. The ambiance was so nice. Rasa macam dekat rumah haha Staff nice and peramah. Paling best dapat flexi 24 hours check in & check out. Rasa tak rugi langsung spend for this hotel. Very recommended. Dinner and breakfast sedap and pelbagai. View dari bilik (deluxe suite) menghadap KLCC, serious superB!!! Bilik and katil luas and selesa. Bathtub pun with KLCC view! Surely will come back again."
"Amazing experience from c/in until c/out process. The room on top of the class, we really love the environment even-thought the hotel located in middle of busy city. All staff very friendly and very helpful, especially Nainman (Butler) we had an amazing memorable stay with The Ruma. We will definitely come back to the hotel next time."
"The best value of money I ever spent for a 5 star hotel. Spacious comfortable room, generous amount of complimentary stuffs, and a great place for a relaxing staycation even for a family despite being at the center of a city."
"Love this Hotel so much, I would say it is one of my Top hotels after traveling in various country. And I was surprised that the best hotel in my life is located in my country Malaysia. The room was high-tech, yet with a tasteful Malay design over it. The room is clean and the service was great.   Will sure be my number 1 recommended hotel in KL"
"The movement when I walk in the Hotel, Mr Hisham bring me in to check our body temperature and he lead us to the main lobby, Mr Ezaz and Ms Prissha welcoming us at the lobby and explained the Golden Baju Kurung. We are here to celebrating our anniversary at ATAS restaurant, food are stunning! Thanks to Mr Bell, Mr Firdaus, Mr Vincent and whole FnB team. Thanks to Mr Rafiky gave us a very warm fond Farewell and lead us to carpark. I will definitely come back again."
"awesome experience, all staff is very friendly. Room so clean and have a nice design. Bed is so comfortable. We all got deep sleep night. walking distance to the pavillion. Overall i really love this hotel and for sure will come back again"
"Having an awesome high-tea at The Ruma with my friends. Home-liked environment with SOP create a comfortable and safe surrounding for us. In addition, new insights and knowledges was gained after a detailed introduction from Adriannna on each of the desserts and pastries served. A satisfying service from Fariz on serving our food and beverage. Lastly, we were entertained by Bell and Khai while enjoying our high-tea. We were impressed and wish to visit again. Thank you!"
Came back the 2nd time to have the high-tea at The Ruma. This time with my friends and we all truly enjoyed the ambience and service given by Adrianna and Fariz from Seven. We were also entertained by Bell and Khai who lived up to the hostmanship as promised by The Ruma.  We totally love the environment and the crowd is well managed. All following SOP and not overcrowding during our visit. However we would like to sincerely ask the chef to relook on their choice of pastries / desserts menu served as some of the food has really odd/weird/unusual pairing of ingredients (November's afternoon tea - the blue theme was wayyyy better than this round's menu). Although we truly understand the specialty of menu but making delicate and delicious food compliment your environment even more.
"Loved it, the ambience, interior, service were wonderful. We had breakfast in the room because the restaurant was not opened on weekday, but I found the hot chocolate a bit underwhelming, but the rest of food was acceptable. Nevertheless, I wont hesitate to make my next booking when the chance arises!"
"Had a very pleasant staycation in RuMa. I love the great feature of The RuMa is its 24-hour check-in/check-out service, i.e. you can check-in and check-out any time you wish. Not forget another feature of The RuMa is the complimentary mini-bar in every room which is replenished daily. The services provided by every staff is superb. Will definitely come back again!"
"We had enjoyed a wonderful stay in this hotel. The hotel and the room design is artistic, all lighting and window shade fixtures are centrally controlled in the room. We are able to adjust the lightings to our liking.  One highlight is their flexi check in and check out arrangement. We were able to fully utilize hotel facilities to our own schedule. Their services are exceptional, special thanks to Jason, Kiki and Angela for their remarkable services during our stay!"
"They are the friendliest hotel staff ever. I just made a call to confirm on the 24hours check in check out, and they were so amazing. The tone of talking, its like they really embrace the art of communication and so honest. I just can't wait to book and experience the service. Well done RuMa! Sorry I forgot to capture the name of first staff and managed to get second, Angela."
"From the welcome to the stay everything here screams comfort and style. Love the cozy, subtle, quiet and Serene athmosphere. It's just a class of it's own. When in KL always choose the Ruma! You will forget that you are actually right in the middle of the busy city center."
"We were really happy and appreciate on the flexible check in/out and daily free minibar facility. The ambience, room, food, staff, everything were at excellent level. Sure we will stay in The Ruma again soon."
Loved the place! Everyone was very friendly and the service team was very prompt whenever we had enquiries. Would recommend for staycation. Very near to both KLCC and Pavilion which was a treat. Close to Grand Hyatt too (for dining in Thirty8)
"1. Friendly and welcoming front house staffs. Straight-forward registration procedures during mco, welcoming drinks served. Very detailed briefing on what services available during mco period. 2. Pool and gym were accesible when we checked in, but we were not prepared for outdoor activities. 3. The room feels really spacious, minimal yet sleek fixtures/furnitures. Big points for the less loose furniture in the room (ie: some hotels do have a lot of empty drawers and furniture). All drawers were filled with useful condiments, cutleries, small plates, 3 types of glasses, etc. No drawers and furniture left emptied. 4. Complimentary mini bar - soft drinks, more than 2 bottles of mineral water, tidbits (muruku, mini dodol & kacang tumbuk) --- so traditional! 5. Hands down to the"
Friendly staff. Love the early check in and late check out facilities. It does suit the concept of ‚Äúrumah‚Äù. Breakfast were great. All staff always great you with smile. Will come again for sure. Thanks
"Good experience, extremely clean and comfortable and super good services and in room dining experience. Spacious room  And toilet. Efficient room services and concierge. I will definitely come back again!"
"Had the six course dinner set..rm248++, IMO quite worth it and reasonable, very ‚Äú malaysianised‚Äù altho I feel there‚Äôs space for improvement eg going wilder with the taste :)  Was served by Bell - great service!! Very friendly and cheerful :)  overall enjoyed my experience dining alone here"
"I would like to thank Bell and Khai for trying their level best to make me feel comfortable (and less awkward) after they found out that I have to dine in at ATAS alone as my partner couldn't make it for our staycation and dinner due to last minute work commitment. Not to forget, their attention to details where they gave me a belated birthday surprise to cheer me up. A big thank you to the SANTAI Pool Bar & Lounge Team for making the surprise happen too.  Indeed the best hostmanship in town that serves you with their heart. Thank you once again."
My Husband and I stayed here over the weekend. I left the next day and forgot my medications in the fridge. I called the front desk and not only they found my medications but their Staff : Nivashinee Sivaraja immediately got a grab delivery (express) to send it to my home. She paid for the delivery (because it wouldn‚Äôt accept cash payment) and refused to allow me to bank in for her. I am amazed how great the staffs are and even personal whereby they treat you like family.
"My family and I enjoyed our stay very much! Everything was top notch, their service and hospitality are excellent. Its a prime location if you want to stay in the city, we only travel on foot because everything is close by, roughly 6-8 mins walk to KLCC or Pavilion. Btw, you would definitely enjoy the breakfast, we certainly did! My son loved the pandan pancake so much, i had to remake it at home. Hehe. Thank you Ruma! It was such a pleasant stay!!"
"Made arrangements with RuMa via Agoda for our 5th wedding anniversary staycation. Agoda coordinated with RuMa accordingly via emails and the service was excellent even before we checked in. Was gladly pleased with some of the generous VIP upgrades for tea time meals and the mini bar. The room was so beautiful and the staff decorated it with rose petals for the occasion. Housekeeping even responded very fast at 1am and two staff came just to deliver a stiffer pillow! The whole hotel was an artful delight for the senses and grammable pictures. We also had our scrumptious fine dining at The Atas restaurant and was superbly attended by Deva, and again by him at breakfast. Outstanding service! Felt like we were in a 6-7 star hotel. Amazing experience all the way right til check out."
"The room was superb and clean and the bathtub was awesome. Staff were friendly and helpful too. But the breakfast was not a buffet, and the selection card was only one for both me and my partner, so it was hard to write down the selections and we recieved some different meals instead."
1) flex check-in and check out is a plus point 2) the minibar is good 3) Just not happy with the in-room limited breakfast selection. I prefer the buffet which has more and better selection. I stay 3 nights but only able to enjoy the buffet breakfast on the 1st night.
"Is a super nice stay. Just a little bit disappointed with their breakfast session only. Because due to the  pandemic, buffet style is change to ala cart style. But feel like lack of employee on floor for the breakfast session, cause hard to grab attention when wanna order, and keep miss out our orders. make us feel not having a nice good breakfast mood."
"Fine touch that is unbeatable in hospitality, amazing choice of decor from the entrance all the way to the room, smart lighting features, fluffy pillows and mattress yet firm for an assured sleep rest, toiletries champion - the bath salt works exceedingly!, consistence housekeeping and hospitality, staff are always  tentative at all time, the f&b at SANTAI - tip top staff and really made my experience a memorable one from the stay, easy check in and check out, also... complimentary minibar.  Only comment i have is the inconsistence breakfast food - 3 breakfast and it never taste the same, delicious still but could be better.   Almost every angle at RuMa is photogenic. Bring your love ones for a satisfying stay. Highly recommended."
"Thumbs up to the employees especially Raj, Kiki and Wani. You have made my stay extremely pleasant and welcoming. The food was good, the room was comfortable and we even managed to use to gym which was very comfortable. The hotel comply with SOP and there seems to be multiple hand sanitizers laying around which makes me feel safe and convenient. Thank you."
"One of the best hotel in KL , top notch service by all the staff , the hotel and staff provides you a very warm and welcoming feeling, which suits its name "" The Ru-Ma"" and the best part is they provide 24hours room service , and flexible check in (as early as 8-10am check in!)  and check out (as late as 8-11pm check out!)"
nice hotel with modern design  room comfy and clean there's bath up that you can use your bath bomb near to KLCC and pavilion - walking distance great breakfast taste awesome nice small pool with great scenery
"We stayed for one night here during new year‚Äôs (prior to that we stayed at The Majestic for 2 nights and had exceptional service). The hotel came highly recommended by a friend. They have the option whether to have breakfast in the room or at Atas. We choose the latter. It took an hour or so for our breakfast to arrive and it was just mine. Not even my husband‚Äôs! After waiting for so long (and we had a restless toddler with us), we told them to just send the food to our room to which they said they can‚Äôt do so but can pack it for us. Our child wanted to swim at it was already 10.30am (we were there since 9am!) but I waited while my husband went to the pool with our child. So once they packed the food, I went to my room. Opened it and saw that there‚Äôs no toast, milk, or cereal"
"We wholly enjoyed our stay at The Ruma, and are looking forward to our next stay! The staff were friendly, prompt and have made our stay the better. The location was surprisingly close to KLCC Suria which only took 3-5 minutes walk across the KLCC park."
"This hotel meet all expectation in terms of services and comfort. They make you feel like a VIP. The hotel is clean and their deco are fantastic. Their food are okay but the are reasonable. However, I do wish their blinds are automated. As it was tedious and noisy pulling the blinds up and down."
Had a lovely staycation at The RuMa Hotel which really was a change of scene for us. We loved the luxurious room which was so comfortable and all the free mini bar  (with coke zero) was a good touch. Dinner at the fine dining Atas restaurant was delicious which rounded off the stay. We found the RuMa a real stress releiever and would love to return!
"Celebrated my partner's birthday at the Atas Restaurant over the Christmas weekend. Received an excellent service from the restaurant staff. The team went above and beyond for us. Even helped with the birthday table set up! Food was great too! Had drinks after dinner at the poolside bar with a beautiful view of the KL skyline. Barkeep was very attentive to all our needs. Thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience at Atas Restaurant.   Special thanks to the restaurant manager Wani, Vincent and our captain for the night Khai."
"When we arrived 9.30am at the Atas, we were told that we need to wait outside at least 30mins. Yes, stand queuing outside. The Ruma, if you can‚Äôt even accommodate such a big crowd of customers, please do not accept all the bookings!"
"This is definitely one of the best 5 star hotels in KL. It feels homey, cosy and intimate. The rooms are spacious and I love the their bathtub. The staffs are fabulous. I have been to almost all 5 star hotels in KL, and I find that the staffs at the RUMA are the most sincere yet they are very  professional. I had meals at ATAS and SANTAI and the food was fabulous. I didn‚Äôt use the gymnasium but the infinity pool is gorgeous. In my opinion, this is the best pool in KL 5 star properties. The hotel is merely 5 mins walk from Pavilion and 10 mins walk from the Petronas Twin Towers. This hotel certainly offers value for money. I‚Äôll be back."
"This was my first return stay at the Ruma Hotel after its reopening since the MCO was lifted. Everything remains great and it‚Äôs impressive how they keep up to such high quality of service and hotel conditions after the MCO and CMCO.   The Ruma Hotel has also put in notable efforts to safeguard the guests‚Äô safety and well-being by implementing strict protective measures in regard to the virus. I am particularly impressed with the proper disinfection done on all the luggages upon the guests‚Äô arrival at the hotel entrance.  This was my birthday staycation and the hotel has also decorated my room for me, and left me a sweet note with a beautiful cake. Appreciate it.  Overall it‚Äôs an enjoyable and awesome experience.  I would also like to extend my gratitude specially to Mr Sebastian"
"The hotel feels so much like your own ruma(h). Staffs are welcoming, attentive & friendly. My requests were fulfilled upon being noticed within 24hrs. The rose petals decor & chocs were complementary from the hotel. The chocs were delectable! I stayed in grand king room & the room was very pretty."
"Am being very grateful to have a supporting team from RUMA throughout the 6 sessions of our Christmas Gala.. everyone has been really helpful and would give their all in assisting our team to successfully coordinate the event..  My compliments to Alex, Chef Tyson, the amazing fnb crew (Wani, Vincent, Adi, Bell and gang), kak Rozita and all for the support.."
Service was unmatched! Literally 7th stay in a year! Love the staff there!! 11 outta ten!!  Got updated to a deluxe suite & a complimentary night! Interiors are worth your instagram profile! Room service menu was also really really good :) recommended all my overseas friends to the hotel!
check in early check out late. this is an awesome convenience for me.  breakfast was excellent tv was not mounted on the centre of the wall from the bed position. for deluxe room only. this is a slight down side.  overall everything is fine
My second visit to RuMa and most of my expectations were met.  Dutiful and friendly staff in what is a swanky and private hotel. A shame I couldn't use most of the facilities but the hospitality and service made-up for it.  Will definitely come back again.
"Clean - first to mention! And their hospitality was awesome. Food was great and they were kind enough to provide complimentary birthday deco and cake (of course, the cake was yummy too!). Seamless check in and check out process. Staff were 101% friendly"
"I was in the hotel to celebrate my husband's birthday. I emailed the reservation department right after the booking was confirmed, and the team arranged a piece of cake and did simple decoration in the room, and it was free-of-charge! The room is clean & cozy with luxury touch. Great customer service. Great location. Great choice for staycation. Awesome interior design.   The only thing that the hotel may need to improve perhaps is the water pressure in the bathroom, not really stable though. Other than this, PERFECT!"
"Prologue Should we forget the right advice to book a corner unit by LIZA? Should we not remember the warm welcome and genuine smile during reception and room introduction by EZAZ? how can we erase the memory of the wonderful decorative touches and mini-gift by SYDNEY? What about that ""ayam curry"" prepared by my wife & SUHAIMI?  Overview As a couple, we were celebrating the beginning of a new life together. It was my wife's first trip to KL, and for this reason she deserves only the best. It took me a tremendous effort to decide where we're going to stay.  We were among the lucky few who stayed at this place during its early opening late Feb 2019. We stayed in a Corner Studio unit for four nights.   The RuMa is a unique concept which literally translates to ""The HoMe""."
We had a very good and relaxed stay in 2-bedroom family studio. All rooms are clean and spacious. They made a simple deco for my husband's birthday and surprised him with a mini chocolate cake. I love the interior and the color palette of the room. The toiletries provided are all of good quality. The breakfast is ok. We also got to experience the pro-sleep massage in UR Spa (my therapist is Era) which is indeed one of the best that I had plus they complimented us with a small bottle of the Tranquility oil which smells soooo good.
"Perhaps the best hotel I have ever stayed in. Service is brilliant, breakfast lovely, the room is beautiful. Cleaning service and turndown service was really good. I really enjoyed my stay here. Brilliant throughout. I will definitely stay here again."
"Check in at 9am,check out 9pm next day. complimentary bed for my kid. Unlimited breakfast served,complimentary minibar,did some birthday deco and chocolate for my birthday. It was a great stay in deed."
"We truly enjoyed our stay at the Ruma.  All the staff we met were very friendly,kind & helpful.  Love the interior & room deco as well. We truly appreciate the flexi check-in & check out too hopefully it remains as such! They accommodated our request for a simple birthday deco in the room. The food was also tasty and the location is quite strategic , a short drive / walking distance to Pavilion KL."
"I stayed in TheRuma last week and to me TheRuma was the bomb! I enjoyed it so damn much till I didnt realize the timing nearly to check out since i have the 24hrs check in and check out and that is what i really love so much and i still didnt manage to check out the swimming pool üò™ But sadly the timing can only be request upon making the reservation cause once you came they wont allowed to change the timing.  For me the breakfast is okay cause i ordered the continental breakfast so there is no much to brag about it. I enjoyed the free minibar and also the coffee machine üòç once come to check in they will gave you the welcome drinks and kudos to that. During my stay, the bedside lamp is not working. And others is working so well. I‚Äôll definitely will come again! Thanks TheRuma"
