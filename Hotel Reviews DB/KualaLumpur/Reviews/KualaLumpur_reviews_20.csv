"The hotel is well connected with all the public transport, centrally located, room service is excellent, decent ambiance. Complimentery Breakfast is continental mixed with one or 2 indian dish. The manger of cafateria is very helpful and friendly. i have given 3star only for the Reception incharge made me to wait for more than 2 hours no proper response and very rude to traveller. The Experianced old man in Travel desk is very friendly and helpful guided me a lot.   except the reception i give 5 star for the hotel."
"There wereseveral issues with our hotel room. For instance, where we in a room on the tenth floor there was a large flip window that with a broken handle that remained open ‚Äì a death trap. I had to block it with a chair and suitcases to prevent one of us accidentally falling out. Additionally, when we arrived there was excrement on the glass toilet door which the hotel failed to clean despite my request.  The selection of food and drinks at the hotel offered during breakfast was extremely poor with no variety."
"We stayed 4 nights at this hotel. The room was small and there were some cockroaches on the table and in the closet! so I had to show killed cockroaches to the reception and they changed our room. The second room was bigger and much better, but as same as all the rooms in this hotel there was no slippers and toothbrush and towels were old. Breakfast wasn't good. Internet was disconnected for 2 days! The best thing about this hotel was the good location and access."
"sexual harassment experienced at hotel metro Bukit bintang   This is a statement I am writing about an unwanted experience which I would put it as sexual harassment . On the 23rd of April , Tuesday, the day I landed in Kuala Lampur from Colombo , I checked into the hotel metro which is located in Bukit Bintang . At 10 pm after I had dinner from Starbucks, I came to the hotel lounge to have a seat while I was on a call with my girl friend. Mr Sunder and employee of the hotel as a receptionist was smiling and I wanted to give him chewing gum after handing him it  he complimented saying I was handsome .After coming back to my seat few moment later he comes to where I was seated .He then touched and squeezed my leg.After I was done talking to my girlfriend  I wanted to go into my"
We were given a complimentary upgrade to a Family Room without informing. As a guest at least you should inform them rather then finding out when you entered the room. Even though the room is big but there is no storage space like a wardrobe and there is no TV console as well. And I will not consider that as a Family Room if the storage space is not there to begin with.   Breakfast spread was okay.   Hotel is good for a short stay but location was superb for me.
"i visited Kuala Lumpur several times  and my accommodations were at this hotel , which is in front of Time square mall and Monorel , it;s cheap and clean hotel , very close to down town , i hope to stay again there if i will visited Kuala again"
"Any room with a king bed could save some money, I think. Carpeted room was pleasant with simple modern decoration. Breakfast does not include a good variety of items. Room service was responsive to query or complaints."
"Stayed here for 1 nite on the 8th of July 2019. Arrived late at about 9pm. Check in was a breeze. After a hectic trip was greeted by 2 Indians ladies at the reception. It was a relief being served by these 2 ladies, they were friendly & polite  The room i booked was an Executive Deluxe. It was big and had more than everything that i've paid for, fridge, hot shower, shower gel, coffee & tea, free water bottle, LCD TV, safe, free breakfast & huge window with a view of the streets & Berjaya Times Square. For the price this is the best value for money in Bukit Bintang. The location is very good, 1 min walk from Imbi monorail station, walking distant from shopping centres, lots of restaurant, groceries stores around. Ok it is not perfect, like cigarattes burn on the carpet, slippery"
The hotel location is ideal as it is in the middle of a shopping and dining area.Thus it is with easy access to any place and transportation requirements either mono rail or bus.  The hotel staff is friendly and helpful and always with pleasing personalities.Rooms are ok. No idea about the food as we were on room only basis.
A very good hotel.i was there for my study trip and the best hotel is le metro.We had a great time over there.The services provided is very good.Reception works very well.Very clean hotel and the housekeeping keep on cleaning which is very good.Keep it going on....Best of luck team of Reception and housekeeping.üòçüòò.Will be back soon with families now.
"The location of the hotel is good and convenient but the facilities is bad and rundown.  Firstly, I booked a Family Room that is supposed to come with 2 King size bed but ended up the hotel ran out of Family Room and gave me a Family Triple that came with a King size bed + Single bed. They simply added an extra bed for me.  On the first night of our stay, the aircon broke down and we were given a stand fan instead.  Besides the above experience, thankfully the breakfast was still acceptable and the staff are friendly."
"very convenient location. Fair price. Good service. Close to all city attractions. Clean. Friendly staffs. They even helped to to hire one Uber. Safe box in room. The location is in center, it may be a little bit noisy if you need quiet sleeping room."
"Hotel is well located. Near to train station, Shopping mall, 24/7 Muslim Restaurant and 7-11. Check-in went smoothly. Required small fee for deposit. Room is acceptable, Toilet as well. TV have variety channel to choose from. The AC have some problem, called the reception and they sent their technician to sort out the AC. Breakfast is a big NO for me. Choices are limited and eating area is small.   Overall, i find this hotel is acceptable if you looking for a place walking distance to Food and Mall. I enjoyed my stay with no complaints."
"This hotel is in a good location to get around and provides a good service. Stayed here for 4 nights. No complains. It is right opposite Times Square Mall, got lots of eating places around it. Also the bus stop to Singapore is opposite the hotel on the side of the Times Square Mall."
"We tried to talk to a lady in front desk w/long wavy hair about putting us at a lower floor,but said its the only available room at 11th floor,and the room she gave us was dirty w/dust on tables and shelf, hair strands on the carpet and bathroom, and the AC is not working, i called front desk,they said wait for 15 minutes before it will get cold,we waited but still nothing. The utility guy came and checked the AC but still nothing,he said we need to go down to Front Desk and we will be transferred to another room and on a lower floor,but when we came down that woman in front desk said we'll be transferred to another room but on the same 11th floor again! They should not have let us go down and up again on the same floor just to give us the keys. Someone could have come to bring"
"With warm welcome we enjoyed the stay for two nights there. Location is really great and the staffs are incredible. Room quality is good for family and business also. They can change the breakfast menu. However, stay over there is worthy."
it was my first experience. my friend told me about this hotel. that time I was nervous but good management and found comfortable for me I like the metro hotel. In the feature I chose metro. and I recommend you all to select the metro.
It was in the center of the city main attractions area. for shopping lovers this hotel is best price for money and all the malls and sephora are on 10 to 15 mints walking distance. breakfast was also too good and served hot
"location in was good near mono rail station and mall and walk able to local food joints , but the facility was very bad, no sleepers, no brush.. the brkfast also dont have much options, AC was also not working properly..no room service in night only in afternoon The reception staff were very helpful, they helped in early check in as in Malaysia check starts at 3 pm  and arranging car for city tour..."
"The metro was in the center of Bukit binthan, conveniently located in the middle of the shopping and food area . Therefore there was no need to take transportation, because it was central.  The only dissatisfaction we faced was the carpets needed cleaning, however they said it was to be replaced.  The WiFi was very good, beds comfortable and spacious, the toilets too were relatively large."
I have stayed in this hotel and the room was spacious bathroom was nice. It is opposite to Berjaya Time Square mall. The low yat plaza is few metres away. The buffet breakfast was nice although no live kitchen during breakfast. Staff was nice and helpful.
"Pros: Opposite Berjaya Times Square Mall Near to shopping mall & eateries  Medium size room Good size bathroom  Cons: Limited parking space Using carpet, smells musky & stained  Hotel is next to the main road, hence it's high in traffic"
"They do not know what customer service is about. We had a room with no window, dark all the time. Poor air circulation with persistent smell. Clearly not recommended.  My relative asked for a change in room. They kept his key and at night upon his arrival after a day out, no one seemed to be aware. The staff to not relay among themselves."
"Stayed in this hotel few years back....fairly good but basic only. This time.....oh no! Room 1003 is full of baby cockroaches! Carpet is filthy and room is smelly. Floor towel and hand towel everyday needs to be requested. Worse still is house keeping took your room card away when they did their round! When u asked for 2nd card, they said they run out of card! Breakfast is basic.   Except their good location at Bukit Bintang, all other factors I rank 2 out of 10. I won‚Äôt be back!  I checked in at almost midnight from overseas trip and by the time I showered and settled down, it‚Äôs 1am. Then I realised the air cond is still not cold so I requested technician to check. He came and asked me to wait for 20mins for it to get cool! I told him, it‚Äôs alredy turned on for 1 hour and if"
"Staying here for 2 night last weekend. Actually I don't really bother about the room condition because I just come late everyday and sleep directly after exploring the city the whole day.   I like that the location near to every attraction places like Alor market, sungei weng , berjaya times square, pavilion and many more. it's easy to go everywhere. you can choose any transportation  you want ."
"Pros: located near monorail, there is fatima (north indian restaurant 24/7), starbucks and mini mart nearby. Hot water, toilet bidet, coffee and tea maker, strong water pressure, aircon is cold  Cons: breakfast is boring and so so. Wifi is on and off. Receptionist/front office staffs not friendly (seriously they need to smile more. If they hate the job, they should consider getting another job). Bed is seriously short, i am 170cm and my feet already reach the end of the bed so sometimes my foot hanging outside the bed during sleep. I specifically asked the 2 rooms i booked to be located at the same floor... it didn‚Äôt happen. 1 of the room i booked should be triple room instead, the hotel gave me double bed with extra bed laying on the floor (matrass only)... not nice!"
"My room is darker than my friends room. Want to moce to another room but no respons from reception. Called reception and she's unpolite. No manners. Phone in my room was broken, I cant make a call to another room. The location is good but the reception/staff attitude make me won't come back to this hotel."
"Hotel was good, room was spacious, bathroom was spacious and clean. The view was great. A lot of shopping malls and places to eat nearby. Transportation to and from the hotel was easy. Many of the staffs speak Bengali so it is no problem communicating."
"I stayed in the executive suite, with that being stated for a budget hotel it was fairly comfortable and close to required amenities. Quiet and swift walk to the mall and restaurants galore.  Staff are always welcoming and kind.  Rooms were comfortable however, the towels need to be upgraded. Old and frayed towels shouldn't be at any establishment.  Breakfast is horrible and bleak.   Travel desk is kind, room service is slow, however the staff are pleasant and attentive.   Overall would recommend just skip the breakfast and go out.  Also use grab to move around its cheaper than metered cabs."
"We have been booked by MAKEMYTRIP 6 superior rooms for family in Metro Hotel, KL. When we checked in and seen the room, we were shocked. It was literally 10√ó10 ft room , no space to move around, carpets were dirty ( it seems that since opening of an hotel they have not washed) , furniture was bulging and ruptured. Initially at reception the guy and a lady manager were suggesting us to go for 2 big family room which looks like a dormitory...How can they even suggest when we paid for 6 superior rooms. Later on after so much discussion with a lady manager ( she was nice person , listening And cooperative) they have upgraded 3 rooms out of 6 rooms. The food was pathetic. When we complained about it, she told us that sorry, I didn't went on inspection today, as we have many guests"
"We visited KL and chose Metro hotel for our stay, the hotel is located near bukit bintang and berjaya Times Square but lacks in basic amenities as internet service is very poor, you may call it next to non existent, breakfast was basic but staff are courteous, polite and friendly. Air conditioning in rooms was below average and rooms are not sound proof since hotel is located next to a main road traffic noise may disturb you deep into night as well. In room safe was also malfunctioning. All in all location is the best part of this hotel."
"Nice rooms, good Staffs and great location.  Decent 3 Star Hotel, cant expect more than that.  Not a great breakfast...could have better spread.  Biggest advantage of this hotel is the location, at Bukit Bintang walking distance to some of the famous Malls & opp. to Berjaya Times Square"
"Excellent location with 2 minutes away  from monorail , 5 minutes from  Berjaya times square mall and 5 minutes from Bukit Bintang in center of Kuala, good stuff and good clean rooms specially those without window and big area to get the best time and relax quiet environment , good breakfast with malay nature"
My family stayed 3 nights .good location and easy to move shopping malls and other activities . Very helpfull staff including front office manager .she is kindly and intelligent handled evey situations with out any objection . BF is not bad but not good far.some items need to be increase . Clean room and worth for the price. Recommended and always stay in future
"I stayed at Metro Hotel Bukit Bintang on 2 June 2018 at Family Room. Our stay was great, they provide breakfast as well. Room amenities was so so as they not provide tooth brush. The location was superb, very walking distance to Imbi Station, Mall and also Alor Street   I definitely come again if I visit Kuala Lumpur. Thank you Metro Hotel :)"
"Been here a few times. Affordable price and convenient for you to move around. Walking distance to Berjaya Times Square,Lot 10, Sungai Wang.Easy food accessible as they have nearby 711 , one Indian stall and Middle East Restaurant when you turn left out from the hotel.Hotel staff lack of smile but very accommodating as they will attend to your request. They don‚Äôt provide toothbrush, shaver and tissue box so please pack them with you. No shower curtain and cubicle so it will get very messy and wet after your shower. Tv channel very limited and aircon coldness is acceptable. 2 complimentary water bottles and coffee/ tea each day.Some chargeable snacks inside the room, it‚Äôs not free!! Morning rush hour can be a pain so if you are leaving in the morning please check out early since"
Good place for stopover as it's very near the transportation hub of Kl sentral.   More comfortable to take rooms with Windows. Those without Windows are very tiny.   Needs to really look into the problems of clogged sinks in the number of rooms we stayed.
Nice n easy located hotel..clean room n toilet nice breakfast very friendly staff.... Easy access to anywhere especially with grab.. Surround by shopping mall.. Food worth fr money Even though the room are quite small fr executive deluxe but ok..
"Perfect Place and only 5 min walk to Berjaya time Square & the Mono Rail Station. The rooms were clean and was cleaned everyday. The Breakfast is ok as well.  Very convenient place and the rooms are very good, worth the amount we paid. The services were very Good as well.  The front office girl named Rachel handled my booking for me, She was very kind and humble to give us a great service, she was very fast with her work and didnt keep us waiting for anything. I really appreciate her service.  Over all the hotel staff were very friendly and good as well.  Thanks & Regards Yoosuf"
"Location is very good, just opposite the Berjaya Time Square and 5 Min walk to Sungei Wang.  Lobby hotel quite small with not so friendly staff, it was a so so service, we got deluxe room which quite big, room was very standard and bathroom also standart  Breakfast not good but also not bad, different menu every day, for taste ya so so  overall the hotel was nice but still need improvement  for service, breakfast and room quality, also the Channel TV just 12 Channel. hehehe"
"I saw  different kinds of rooms,  they are clean, spacious, and have most what you need, besides good and friendly staff, so I think this hotel is a good choice for leisure travelers who have a tight budget, and want to be near everything."
"The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is located near a big shopping center where we can get every thing in good price.Rooms are ok, if in front to see city out side. Service is not that prompt as I experienced. wifi works well."
"The metro hotel is situated near the city centre and the malls It s a nice hotel. Clean rooms, good working wifi. The bathroom is clean, good shower, shampoo, bodylotion. Showergel Prima beds Good breakfast."
"Booked this hotel when I went for a concert held at Stadium Merdeka, didn't want to find anywhere too far since I was expecting heavy traffic before & right after the concert, came across this hotel online which is conveniently nestled between the stadium and berjaya times square. My partner and I were given a room at the highest floor, the room was spacious and very well kept. The service was great as the housekeeper attend to our requests with smiles. We were lucky enough to catch the very limited free parking spaces provided by the hotel too, which is a major plus seeing that the parking fees around that area were pretty expensive. All in all, good experience, great stay for their location and for the price they offer."
"We booked the executive queen room.. number 907. Great views from the 9th floor. Room was very quiet with a super comfortable, huge bed. Bed linen clean and well maintained. Towels were getting thin and showing signs of wear.  The included breakfast provided some choices for vegans. For us the location was not fantastic as we like to walk everywhere and the hotel was surrounded by very busy roads, so not great. Overall, a good value choice."
"I had been to the hotel last year with my husband and kids for one week. Our stay at the hotel was a really nice one. The room we got was quite spacious with two big beds. Toiletries and 2 small bottles of water were supplied to us on a daily basis. However, the carpet on the floor in the room needs a good cleaning.  As for breakfast buffet, we had the chance to discover the local cuisine which we thoroughly enjoyed along with continental items.  The staff is very courteous, helpful and friendly. They were always ready to give us advice and they even prepared us a bountiful packed breakfast on the day of our departure. The hotel is ideally situated and we were able to take the monorail, which is only a few minutes away, to many destinations at a very cheap price. Also, Berjaya"
"Booked the hotel through travel agent. promised tipple accommodation room was not given. somehow managed an extra bed but no space left!! management and service was poor. city location is ok, Time square was just near."
This was a convenient hotel accomadation. The staff being eager to help. It was fairly nice and clean. It was close to station thus giving easy access to places of interest and clise to ammenities. Food spread was adequate and we were primarilly in KL for site visits.
"Hotel booked by my local travel agent through its agent in KL - 1st visit to this hotel and was very deceived.....- apart from good location, large rooms, would not go there again......poor room service / not clean....breakfast : strict minimum.... staff not so helpful, apart from Front office / reception team .... Have been to hotels of better standards, although not luxurious ones.... don't know about rates / prices - since were included in our package tour"
This Hotel is at the Shopping center of KL. Big malls are in the vicinity at walking distance. The KL Hop On Hop off 6th Stop is also near by for the explorer of the city attractions. They offer comfortable clean rooms. The staff is also very friendly. All city tours can be arranged from the tour agent at the lobby. They offer a great breakfast too. The only problem for me was the limited variation of breakfast and expensive menus.
"I love staying here. This is my second time stayed at this hotel and it never let me down. Starting from the reception counter where the receptionist was very friendly and process fast check in (10 minutes) to the room I was assigned to was according to my request which the room was spacious and clean. Even though there is no Prayer Mat and Iron and Iron board, I called extension '0' and it took them only 5 -6 minutes to deliver the items to my room. Their service was super-fast. The bathroom was clean as well. Breakfast was good. Where can u get a cheap hotel in the middle of the city with varieties of breakfast spread and a spacious room with clean environment? Highly recommended.   It's just that, as for me the hotel better lock permanently the window as when you stay at a"
"I would like to say that this hotel is good and comfortable.. They provide wide and nice room to stay in kuala lumpur This place also located in the central of kuala lumpur,their staffs also very kind"
The hotel locations is very convinient and this is our must stay hotel everytime we went to Kuala Lumpur. But for this time we are a bit dissapointed due to the room air-condition and the wifi. hopefully only for this time as we do look forward to stay here again!
"Hotel room is huge, but very basic. Breakfast is good. Location is great with mrt station just 3 min walk from hotel. Berjaya mall is across the hotel. Try their theme park's roller coaster. I will definitely stay here again next time."
"Location  - The Location was a plus point...near imbi monorail station - Near Berjaya Times Square and Walking distance to other malls such as sungei wang, low yat plaza - nearby 7 11 and kk mart to get some snacks or stuff at night  Service - The Doorman was attentive to our needs. - Receptionist Santi was efficient, pleasant and very helpful for a smooth check in and check out process. - Room service were attentive to our needs such as a change in the freezer due to freezer not cold...need it to store my kids bottle and food - They respond fast when i needed extra plastic for the bin   Room - Room was satisfactory..I book the family room...2 big beds...clean and neat beds. - clean toilet -wifi was superb...smooth - Need to change the carpet as it was badly stained.  Breakfast"
"We spent nearly a week at the hotel. The key benefit of staying here is, the convenience of the location. Berjaya time-square is just there and you can spend late hours doing shopping without any hassle cos you don't need to worry about going back to the hotel, it's literally there itself. This place is of walking distance to many tourist attractions in KL, the Pavillion and all the street markets as well. As for the rooms, what I admire most is the view. We got a room facing the time-square and with all the lights at night you cant just look away, it's that spectacular. The rooms were clean and bathrooms were spacious. Meals were okay, but it could be improved. Overall it's a good place to stay if you are looking for inexpensive options. I would return !!"
"The location of the hotel is a mere 200m from Imbi monorail station, which makes travelling around KL easy. The room/bathroom was spacious and clean. The air-cond was centralised, not too cold. The check-in process was quick. Breakfast was good. Overall, it was a good stay - would return again."
"Location-wise this place was great, across from Berjaya Times Square and Imbi monorail station and on walking distance to many other malls. Clean bathroom.  We had a problem with the wifi though, a bit weak connection.  Just improve it for the hotel good. Overall this hotel is good"
Everything is just awesome about this hotel. I was solo traveler and stayed 4 nights. Great room with nice view. Excellent location. Clean bathroom.Very friendly helpful stuffs. Again going to stay with family this time. :)
"I found the hotel very neat and clean. Hotel staff are polite and helpful. Most important thing is that, the hotel is 1-2 minutes away from Imbi metro station which helped me to travel around easily. There are also food courts nearby, so I found everything in walking distance,which was my main requirement as a tourist."
"I indicated at the time of booking that I will pay in local currency at checkout, but the hotel ignored this and charged my credit card. The clerk was unhelpful and behaved as if she did not know nor understood this option - and was incapable of doing anything nor tried to get help from anyone about it. She appeared as if she was totally untrained and unsuitable for the job and was just standing there to do the most undemanding of chores. Will definitely avoid this place."
"The staff at the reception  ,the Front desk are not professional , they are more interested at there mobile phone to the client , even laughs at you , when you ask information, and talk in there own language ,  girls taking selfies at the reception , even listening to music on phone . When we arrived they just ask for our booking .Not even a welcome greeting , no information about the hotel . Just ask for the payment of the depot at the arrival and give you the key of the room . Just tell you take the passenger lift go on which level where is the room. And live you on your own .Nobody accompany you to give the room and give information about the room .   As you step at the reception area , it smell you are at Little India , put some air freshener , please .  About the room, have"
Its very convenient and inexpensive in the Bukit Bintang area and really convenient i was able to eat simple breakfasts but thats not a highlight  the staff were very helpful but the lifts have a mind of their own and a timeline to suit themselves but yes i would use this hotel again
"had booked a family room and found the rooms to be very spacious  the Location is very good as is is close to Bukit Bintang for shopping and jalan Alor for street food the front office staff are quite indifferent and have a very fake smile they need to be trained  to be more courteous and polite a special mention to Ms Noorie who was very helpful when we were locked out of our rooms even before checkout time and Raju the bell boy / attendant who was always smiling and would guide you to places to visit ,local Shopping And always give Accurate directions the buffed Breakfast is average with No live Egg counter Hotel amenities are bare minimal; 1 soap bar, 1 shower cap and 2 mini shower products (even tough we were 4 persons in a family room) tooth brushes / shaving kits, body"
"Stayed at Metro Hotel for 4 nights. Location-wise this place was great, across from Berjaya Times Square and Imbi monorail station and on walking distance to many other malls.  Accommodation-wise it was a bit disappointing. We booked the Executive Deluxe room, which was very spacious and looked as pictures stated, but upon closer look we saw that the carpet was quite old and stained. Hotel amenities was minimal; 1 soap bar, 1 shower cap and 2 mini shower products. The towels were old and worn, no refills on the toilet paper and there was no handheld shower head, but the bathroom was clean and also spacious.   The bed and bedlinen were clean and we had good sleeps. Our room had nice views over the city since it was on the higher floors.  Front desk employees were neither friendly"
"Was my second stay at this hotel and must say that we got the smoking floor at first and they move us on our demand cause my friend was not able to breath properly due to smoke. Overall the hotel is nice, breakfast can be better. In the rooms for me it need some refresh to be done, the carpet was not that clean and smells a bit in the toilet too. Wifi was bad too."
"I really appreciate this hotel , the staffs are so kind to me , and I really appreciate my stay ... 4th times in this hotel  Accurate place to shopping centres and restaurants .  I will surely go back when I will be in KL  Cheers to all the team of the hotel"
"We are arrived there at around 2 o'clock and was greeted by Mr Raju the porter. We stayed there for 8 days in Superior room 8th floor on bed and Breakfast. Everyday we had a variety of different food selection for breakfast. The chef was very helpful and even told us about some shopping tips.  The location of the hotel is perfect, very near to the Berjaya Shopping mall, eleven(supermarket), restaurants, Starbucks, Jalan alors( The food night market) and the famous night market ""Chinatown"".   Our room was cleaned everyday and the housekeeping never touch any of our belongings.   We had a problem with the wifi though, a bit weak connection at around 11 p.m most of the day.   Each and every staff of the hotel were very friendly and helpful.   One small problem, that I would like to"
"stayed for 2 nights with friends and satisfied with the room and service but not really have facilities. The location near to Berjaya Times Square and have to walk maybe for 10minutes to Jalan Alor and Bukit Bintang. We booked for family room for 4 guests and the room is big enough. The breakfast also good. But they only give us one key for one room, just incase how if we go separately and cannot get in touch each other? One of cannot get into room if the others not yet back to room. Just improve it for the hotel good. Overall this hotel is good, will stay here again next time."
"This was my second time to stay in metro hotel. Hotel itself located at excellent location which easy to access shopping malls, Time Square, Sungai Wang, Lot 10, Pavilion and etc all with walking distances. Room was clean and tidy, basic amenities and facilities(hairdryer, water heater), free mini bar and WIFI. Breakfast was tasted yummy but if add on more choices on main dishes will be better. So far was satisfied for my stayed, definitely will back for the 3rd times."
"Stayed here for a night during the MotoGP weekend in Sepang. Checked in past 5pm and it was processed fast!  Booked a basic double room but was upgraded to a family room. Spacious room, separate shower and toilet cubicle. Large window overlooking the skyline. Room is clean though some parts of the furniture showed its age. This however is barely an issue given everything else.  Excellent location. Berjaya Times Square is just across, there's a hawker store just beside the hotel. Monorail just a minute's walk away."
"Metro Hotel is literally 100 yards from Imbi monorail which makes this hotel the perfect base for your stay in KL. And you are the best side of the motorway with the major shops, Jalan Alor and Bukit Bintang only minutes walk from the hotel. The rooms are very comfortable, the staff are very friendly and the breakfast is adequate. We will definately stay here when i visit KL."
"The location is great. The room is great. The double bed is too short so it's a bit tricky for a tall person like me to be able to sleep fully on the bed hahaha. Forget the wifi, it doesn't work. Word of advise, better try to catch the taxi directly from the street than from the hotel counter"
"My experience was not positive at all.First we get a where the air condition was very troubleful,so we have to change our room.That room was alright.Breakfast was so poor,limited breakfast everyday.But the location and overall environment was good."
"PRO: Check in and out was fast & efficient. The staffs at the reception were friendly and courteous. I was given a single-bed bedroom facing the busy roads, which is nice because I got unobstructed view of the city. Everything about the room is generally nice and seems pretty new. The size is decent, the layout of the bathroom was nicely thought out. Water pressure is good. Ample shelves to keep your stuff. Safety box and a small fridge are available together with complimentary tea and coffee.  CONS: The carpet tainted with so many dark/dirty stains. The Deluxe King room that I stayed reeked of cigarettes so much so the smell lingered on my clothes."
The first time my family and I stayed there for 10 days and we enjoyed a lot at metro hotel. This is the second time and we stayed for 12 days at metro hotel bukit bintang. Everything is the same and we enjoyed the same way. What we liked about the hotel is that it's very close to berjaya times square and the imbi monorail station. The catering service and staff was nice like the first time and breakfast also has improved. I personally recommend this hotel to everyone. We really enjoyed there and hope that next time during our holiday in Malaysia we will stay at metro hotel bukit bintang
"I'd Book a superior double room (superior !?) upon arrival we checked in and went up to our room which reeked of cigarette smoke despite being non-smoking, the carpet was totally dirty and the air conditioning not working. We called the front desk to complain and they said they would come up to check it out ... 20 minutes later no one came back calling again, we were told they would go up ... 20 minutes later without anyone coming in we grabbed all our luggage and went down to the Lobby to sort this out personally. Once there with a frightful face for the scandal we could do in the lobby we were given another larger room. We went upstairs and it was better, even though the air conditioner the carpet was just as dirty and the refrigerator did not work. In the morning (10 am) we"
I was using superior queen rooom. Toilet is clean and large enough. Room facility is okay. But carpet is quite old and bed is not really good. Very closed to imbi station.. However I enjoy to stay here.
"Booked a Executive Deluxe room. Very nice and spacious. Good window view of the city. The staff were very friendly and very eager to help. Breakfast was decent.The location of the place is close to monorail with Berjaya Time Square is on the opposite side of the road. The Hotel is also close to the main Bukit Bintang area and also close to KLCC. As such it is very convenient to see places within the proximity of the hotel. There is free wifi however, I would not give the wifi a high grade as it drops off occasionally."
the hotel is a ok place to stay but definitely not a budget hotel is is a low end budget hotel the pics on the website are like that of a young bride in her wedding dress with all makeup  but when you go to stay it is not a bride but a old haggard toothless Maid they do not provide you with a dental kit and shaving Kit as shown in website the if you book a triple sharing room you are only provided with a  amenities for 2 people they do not provide extra toilet rolls and Bath Towels  which you have to request and they really take quiet some time to get it to your room the shampoo  is also not sufficient  as i was travelling with wife and daughter who have long hair also note only 2 bottles are provided  per room  even if it is triple sharing requested to speak to the manager but
The location of the hotel is good. It is just near the imbi rail station and not far from the kl central. There is a big mall on the opposite side for shopping and also has some restaurants. The rooms were normal sizeÔºåthe double bed was a bit shorter than normal and there was some odour in the room which the hotel staff attended to. The buffet breakfast was alright. The staff were not very welcoming though and also the reception washrooms are not maintained. Overall the stay was good and the staff responded well to our issues.
"Booked a family room(2 queen size beds) and only 1 key is given. I am not sure if it is normal as this is the first time i received only 1 key for a room. As usually at other hotels & countries, we were given at least 2 keys. The dressing table has no mirror so all of us have to rely on the one and only mirror in the toilet. Walking distance to Berjaya time square though. We visited KL at least once a year and have stayed in a lot of hotels near the Berjaya time square,I don't think I will come back here ."
"The location of the hotel in indeed great without a doubt, it's located between 2 LRT station (Imbi & Hang Tuah) where you can roam anywhere in town further easily and will cost you almost nothing since you don't take taxi and uber anymore.  There is also a supermarket located around the corner of the hotel where you can get your daily need to fill up your hotel fridge. We choose not to pick the paid breakfast that was offered to us by the hotel because we wanted to try the local restaurants near by (plenty of options) and would cost a lot less than the one in the hotel.  Everything is great about this hotel but one thing, the staffs (people at the front desk). Yes, they don't smile to me at all, from the arrival until the departure. One of the front desk person was also BAD at"
"nice place...good place..The rooms are large, comfortable and offer all the amenities you could want. The property is also new and modern, We were in Kuala Lumpur for three days only and for the first time ever we stayed and enjoyed a full..."
"the hotel is in a very strategic location. near the subway station/ KL central and airport shuttle bus stop, only 10mins in walking distance. friendly staff. clean room with basic facility, value for money, and lot of local food stall around."
"I enjoyed the stay at Metro , basic services against your money , breakfast is too basic with no variety.... but no problem especially they let us check in early due to our long flight...just be careful of GST  Location is very good , wi fi is very good all the day , staff are friendly... supportive especially the guard ."
"I stayed 03 nights and 04 days and this hotel treats me really well. Clean Rooms, wash Room,Towels..Etc . Friendly staff too. And just walking distance to main shopping centers.  Breakfast was yummy..Had few options like noodles,bread,nasi goreng and sausages.  I stayed on the 12th floor and the view has been just tremendous."
"Right next to Times Square shopping centre, Bukit Bintang and monorail stations- this hotels location was amazing.  The room was adequate, it had a comfy bed and the shower was fine. The rooms smelt like someone had been smoking in it prior to us, but we opened the window and let it air and was better when we returned later.  We had a late flight the following day, so we wanted the room for longer. We had to pay 100MYR until 6pm or an extra nights fee until 8pm. We opted for the 6pm option. I looked online and there were still many rooms available that night, so, they were unlikely to resell ours and could have just let us have it until 8pm, but didn't.   The staff were the let down of the hotel. We asked for toilet paper which we then had to call again to receive, it took 15"
We request to the receptionest to check the room at 12:00 pm but he told that you have to wait until 3:00 pm. No complimentry tooth paste & brush in the wash room. Aircondition system totally poor. Room is totally hot.  Poor breakfast only few item.  Usd 90 dollars for two night is totally over priced like a poor service. There is no swimming pool.  In tour desk we request to visit putrajaya they asking charge RM 300 for two person but atlast we arrange it by taxi only RM 90
"Dirty stained wall , dirty stained carpet, uncomfortable pillow, I asked to change it with no response, one roll of tissue only andused after 2 dayes and they didn't replace it ,very limited choices of food in breakfast, Asian type of food, sure I will not stay there again"
"I stayed there for 4 nights. The hotel is located just opposite to Berjaya Times Square and walking distance to Low Yat Plaza and Imbi station. So everywhere was easily accessible. The room was very comfortable, clean and cozy. No deposit was required on check-in. The hotel offered tours around KL but I personally thought it was really expensive. If you book any outside taxi or take buses, it might be way cheaper. The staffs were polite and always welcoming. Overall I had a good stay."
"Only stayed 2 nights, nice hotel, situated near Petronas Towers, monorail stop just across the road from the hotel.  Twin bedroom which I stayed in was nice but the beds were too short, not suitable for anyone over 5'6""."
"Been there for 4 nights recently, booked executive room. Don't know what was 'executive' about that room really but it was the adequate size, sound proof, big windows, lcd tv, coffee maker, safe deposit box, fridge...seemed to be a shot. But.. the wall to wall carpet was last century dated and probably last cleaned at the same time, and it smelled like feet/dirt/ash/sweat/mud combo. Double bad was 180cm long only and I am 185cm high , so you could imagine.. There were two water leaking points in the bathroom (toilet and washbasin), the shower water temp was nearly impossible to adjust, there was a daily shortage of at least one towel, breakfast was ...yes , what can I tell, the breakfast was! The reception crew were nothing more than professionally polite, only two bell boys"
"we had a nice time there, room was clean, good networkwifi, food was excellent, by the way i salute the chef who is a gentleman. loved this place. looking forward to go there this year. all was just perfect. thank you everybody. was there from 13-23 dec 2016"
We travelled last december and we stayed for 3 nights at the metro hotel.Located at central of the city its just few minutes 9f walking distance to the malayasias well known shopping centre berjaya time square. The ambiance of the hotel was perfect. Where as food is concerned the spread did not contain a large variety but it was worth it for the price we paid.Metro hotel could be recommended for all those shoppaholics who spend most of their  time on the streets as this hotel is perfectly located at the centre of many shopping centres adding more value and convenience to your stay
"stayed for 2 nights in the cheapest room on 10th floor. this hotel provides the essentials and is sufficient if all you need is a clean room to sleep in.   pros: - very close to imbi station and berjaya times sq - clean room, towels, bed - strong air con - good water pressure - working tv with a movie channel - in room wifi  cons: - no shampoo/shower gel, toothbrush/paste, comb provided - almost the whole toilet gets wet after showering - hair dryer inside the toilet fixed to the wall poses a possible safety hazard (although nothing happened to me) - only bath towels provided, no smaller towels"
"Booked family quad WITHOUT breakfast on the 22nd dec 2016 for a six days stayed.On arrival at around 7pm,the FAT MAN at the reception told us just to mention the room number(No 711) for the breakfast.We ONLY WISH to try the breakfast on the last day(28 dec) of stayed.But the FIERCE looking man at the cafe told us to reconfirm at the reception counter.At the counter the female receptionist just answer us ""I DONN'T KNOW"".Anyway we took the breakfast outside.we feel ashamed if for a free breakfast we have to argue.AND we were given only one pack (20 ml) of shower gel for FOUR persons on the second day of stayed.But Five packs for the third day.Will NEVER come back again even if the room price is reduce to half !"
"Dont expect more about service, I just want double key card room but the hotel policy is prohibited, i just dont get it, how can i go buy some drink outside in the midnight when my room mate is sleeping,  For management please rethink again about ur policy, or maybe this policy only for standar deluxe room"
"Stayed one night, Free WiFI in rooms, Old hotel but location is really good. Just a minute walk to Times square and metro station. Bed and breakfast, breakfast spread is just ok.  Basic facilities are good for the money spent. Do not expect great like a 3/4/5/star."
We came here on holidays and the staff from each and every department of the hotel exceeded our expectations. They were just awesome which suit perfectly the facilities at the hotel. We had a great time and will definitely recommend Metro Hotel to others ! A special thanks to Mr Mohammad Abdud Rouf and Mohammad Nahiduzzaman who were ever ready to help people as well as the receptionists who were marvellous - always cheerful - very professional. Thanks for the heavenly experience :)
