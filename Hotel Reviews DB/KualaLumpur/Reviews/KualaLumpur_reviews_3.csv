"Came here for a birthday celebration. While all staff are being outstanding, Emily See needs a special mention. Prior to check in, she had prepared the room with decor and surprises. She checked me in personally.   Being a first timer at this hotel, there was so much to explore. First, being escorted to the designated room, it was being upgraded due to Accor status. Next, Emily See whom I have known from previous hotel stay remembered my personal request. Chilled sparkling water and whatnots awaited. I couldn't been any happier.  Moving on, as a platinum member, I availed myself for free flow of freebies such as sparkling water, chill water, aerated drinks and juices, coffee and tea. The selection was fabulous. U could even ask for coffee with almond milk, good for those who"
"I lived in Hong Kong for 28 years, so have had a fair share of Cantonese Dim Sum.  Our lunch at Jade Pavilion at the Pavilion Hotel by Banyan Tree (in the company of two other long time HK'ers who were equally impressed) was simply OUTSTANDING.   Every single dish was well presented, fresh, tasty, presented¬†well with ¬†exploding with flavours. There is no MSG aftertaste and it‚Äôs halal.  We had ¬†Har Gau, Siu Wai, Yam Puffs, Beancurd Rolls, Rice Rolls, the broccoli with garlic chips, seafood fried rice and topped the meal off with the (salted!) sago mango dessert and sesame dumplings in almond milk which had us smiling for hours (even while writing this).  The brand new restaurant looks beautiful, is bright and airy with a classy feel. The service is outstanding, genuine, warm and"
"Friendly and courteous staff started from the moment we took the lobby lift to 8 floor to check in. Check-in was quick and friendly.  Room is clean, tidy and comfortable. Hotel were good in providing complimentary face masks. Club lounge staff were attentive and helpful. Good cocktail drinks.  Breakfast was good spread with amazing servers and chefs.  Recommended for a good relaxing stay. Conveniently located next door to huge shopping mall to satisfy one‚Äôs buying desires."
Stayed a night for my wife's birthday. She wanted to shop at Pavilion Mall. From the reception to the room and then the breakfast... the staff were really there to please. We were given an hour extra than expected for check out time which was really helpful. Our room was beautifully decorated for the occasion with a mini but delicious cake to boot. There were also 6 bottles of water provided complimentary which was very thoughtful. Breakfast was abundantly tasty. Everyone was so helpful. The only set back was an unpleasant experience with the valet when we arrived and it could have escalated to become a major frustration... but then we were told that it was his first day on the job so we just cut him some slack. No hard done at the end of the day... and the reception had also
Super friendly staffs. The food superb! So delicious and ruined my diet lol. The room spacious and nice! The only things  im a bit disappointed was the pool view. So many construction from nearby buildings.
It‚Äôs been a long time since I stayed in a hotel because of the lockdown and it is a welcome change and I‚Äôm happy to be back taking time off and have a relaxing time in a nice hotel.   This is one of my favourite hotels to stay when I am in KL because of its location and also the services provided. The staffs are all extremely friendly and make you feel very welcome the moment you step out from the lift at the lobby. Great job on that because not every hotel does this as well as you.   I booked a urban king room but was upgraded to a suite which was a pleasant surprise. The room is big and comfortable as always. The club lounge is currently closed but we still can go to the courtyard restaurant for our drinks and evening cocktail. So that is not a big issue.   Overall we had a
"Stayed for a few nights, great hotel,  best best location, very friendly, courteous and excellent service by the staff, esp Maideen,  Juhairi, Hafiz, the night duty mgr Faiz and the other frontline staff, really enjoyed my stay, will definitely recommend to friends and will go back again!"
I‚Äôm very satisfied with my stay in this hotel..all staff are very friendly.buffet breakfast was delicious. My stay was extremely comfortable. Great location. Definitely will come again because of the great hospitality.

Stay was almost perfect with the promo price and service offered. Staff very friendly and helpful. Satay is the best in the world. However my request for HDMI cable not fulfil and access to pavilion mall is uncomfortable due to COVID-19 SOP. We need to use escalator while having baby using stroller.  Overall I am happy with my stay
Love this hotel so much! Room was very spacious & comfortable. Most amazing thing is the service provided. They actually made an effort to call and check if everything is OK after you checked in. View was super nice too.  Location is superb and convenient with just an escalator away from the Pavilion shopping mall.   Special shoutout to Steven at the reception for his professionalism & fantastic service! Because of your service I'll definitely stay here again!
"I had prepaid booking for 31 days in this hotel (I'm diamond member of Accor, my friend Accor Plus member) due covid-19 restrictions i was not able to come to KL, so according Accor politicy I asked to change dates of my booking - of course in same price and I get agreed answer with some option of dates. When I choose a date which was offered me by hotel, hotel cheated me, wanted to change rate to higher than I made a booking and eaven higher than was at website. When I asked about contact to  GM with a question why I was cheated, it was told me that it is position of GM. So if you do not want to be cheated better not do booking in this hotel.  If it is politicy of pavilion KL i will consider if I will make shopping there again"
"My friend made a reservation for my birthday at the hotel restaurant. It was my first time visiting and I am astonished for the warm ambiance. Upon arriving, we were greeted by the staff. The decoration made was lovely and it was a wonderful night. Indeed worth a memory to be kept.   Overall, it was a night to be remembered. Special thanks to Hafiz, Esca, Raziq and to Chef Ramduil, Chef Rasajani for the lovely food! It was a beautiful night with a beautiful staff !"
"There is not a single negative thing that you can talk about in staying at this hotel. From the moment you enter this hotel, you will be amazed by the friendliness of staff and the service they offered.  I'm sure you love this place as much as I do. Will definitely return to this hotel. No doubt. 200% ."
"Starting from the moment we step in until we leave this hotel surprise us in many ways. Room was great and clean, check in was smooth, evening cocktail was great, in room dining was efficient and breakfast was superb.  Upon checking in we were surprise with Cupcakes in our room from Duty Manager Jojo, followed by cake platter by FOM Remco. Evening cocktail was at the Cortyard and service from Hafiz was great. He was efficient and attentive even he was  busy with his task but he managed to exceed our expectations.   Lastly it‚Äôs a great hotel for a short break from your daily busy routines (get a club room). Thank you Pavilion Hotel and team for your wonderful service even at this current pandemic situation. Will definitely be back soon."
"Was pleasantly impressed with the great & warm hospitality from the entire hotel staff. Was warmly greeted by Michelle Lim, the Duty Manager who also took the extra mile to make our stay most memorable with the personalized service. She personally delivered a cake to our room. Thanks Michelle! Your warmth & great hospitality really made the difference!  The room was spacious & nice. Breakfast was good too! Will definitely be back!"

"It was our first time staying at Pavilion Hotel. We were just looking for a place with direct access to shopping. Boy were we blown away by what Pavilion Hotel had to offer.   - Clean rooms, comfortable beds, no smell of dust or any sort from the carpets. Their standards for cleanliness is very high.   - Spacious bathroom and toilet- Rain shower with amazing water pressure. Loved the hair dryer too! It is the little things that makes all the difference!   - Very friendly and accommodating staff and reception members at every point in the hotel. Makes u feel right at home!   - Direct access to mall. ding!   Will definitely recommend everybody and will definitely come back again ourselves!"
"Everything is near to perfect, except for the room which has strong smoking smell despite hotel is smoking free hotel.  Staff is helpful to provide air freshener machine in the room to resolve the problem. Although it kill the smoking smell, it didnt help my baby sleeping comfortable level. So, we dont really have a good sleep."
"We stayed at the hotel to usher in the new year. I thought we made an excellent decision to try out the Pavilion Hotel for the first time. The hotel is located adjacent to the Mall, making our shopping and dining experience a convenient and happy one. The reservation experience was great - a shout out to Roshidi, the Club Lounge Manager and his team. They managed our multiple reservations well - even calling us a couple of days before our stay to explain to us the parking process etc. They also managed to have all our rooms on the same floor - my mom was happy to know that her grand daughters were all safely nearby. Housekeeping staff were extremely friendly despite the very busy time of the year. Breakfast was excellent (on the first day) but we were not too excited for the"
"I had birthday suprise by Courtyard Restaurant. They have plan well with my wife. I impressed. The hotel is very nice, clean and great.  my daugther love their Bartub and you know what? Room Service is 24 HOURS. Thanks.  thanks to Raziq, Esca and Bob."
I had an enjoyable getaway over here at Pavillion Hotel KL. Service was beyond excellence and met every requirement of mine. Loved that the hotel was promoting ways to ensure hygiene during meals especially at the buffet area.
"Can't get a more convenient location than this Pavilion hotel, room and bathroom was spacious with all the amenities and double vanity. Would be nice if there's a bath also. Breakfast great variety. Room sound proofing is good too. Nice rainshower."
"This was the first time that we are staying here. Previously, we stayed at several other hotels nearby. This was indeed the best of them all. It was a great stay and we are pleased with the services provided. Excellent in every way. Easy access to the mall, comfortable room and  great breakfast spread."
Great is the hospitality shown by the team. The smile and greetings are warm to heart.  It‚Äôs real relaxing staycation amidst the bustling city. Definitely be back to there again with longer stay. Thank you.
"All Services is Excellent from Check In till Check Out! Check in and Check out is Super fast, Room is great value for money, Breakfast is nicely arranged, Pool is awesome, the best is all the staff are Amazing."
Excellent customer service. Their Staff greets you at every oppurtunity. They were running at full capasity during my stay but they manage the breakfast crowd with such profesionalism.. Will definetely stay here again. Kudos Pavillion Hotel Staff.
Strategic location with direct access to shopping malls and eateries. Value for money. Services from the staffs are also good. Room is well kept and clean. The spread of breakfast was just simple and standard one.
"I'm so happy and very satisfied! Very recommended for those who wants to staycation in Kuala Lumpur. Easy access to Pavilion, really enjoy my breakfast buffet and for sure I will stay and come here again! :)"
"overall customer service are Excellent, Wishes all staffs are same, avoid double standard service.   Please provide chicken rendang instead of beef, Lontong without kuah kacang, it really less of taste."
"Friendly n well train staff. Location is excellent, walking distance to all malls,KL Tower, Twin Tower n eateries. Pavillion Mall is excellent place to shop for branded goods n to relax n hang around the many cafe n drinking outlets"
"Due to location, certainly ideal and very convenient. Importantly the staff do justice to the property. Their service, courtesy, promptness is to be lauded. And rooms are comfortable. Breakfast is ok."
"This hotel best for business, meetings and leisure for all your needs. It is very convenient. Great location and accessible everywhere. Wonderful and lovely hotel. People are friendly. Top notch services, you get what you need. Clean and fresh flowers display which makes you joyful to stay. Great value for money.

Overall is great experience to stay. Friendly staff. Location is great and beside the shopping mall. Infinity pool and gym is good. Thanks for room upgraded to another category which is complimentary. A pleasant and suprise to stay and thanks to the staff who helped to change the room.
"The service at the Hotel was exceptional. There was absolutely no issue that was not addressed timely and with satisfactory results. We were particularly impressed with how the hotel staff anticipated our needs. I am so appreciative that there exists a place that still values customer service throughout the hotel. The staffs were phenomenal, esp Emily See, Esca, Maideen, Sasi and Asril!"
"The Urban Studio room is super in size and  the big bath tubs allows both of us enjoy the evening sun set under the water.  Staff are really friendly and able to greet with smile and able to remember my name. The East facing infinite pool allow you to enjoy the best of it at 8am. Sauna room was clean and no smell. Food wise was not so grand comparing to other international 5 star hotel. Still got room to improve. However, limited bottle of foreign beer offer in club lounge which is not offer by other hotel. Will visit again with kids to try out the gym room next year."
"You have no advice because everything is perfect and awesome and really we had a lovely time in this hotel, and really the servers were awesome. I only have a note, and because of the current circumstances, it should be a reasonable discount for the family for me. I should have booked two rooms, and this is for a lot of money. I hope you appreciate these points and that if the price was lower, I was hoping  to spend  until  the end of New Year"
"Great hotel with excellent hospitality. Room were brand new and clean with comfortable beds. You have an amazing staffs in your team..truly superb hospitality from them... Breakfast are ok, but could improve for more varieties... Overall, excellent stay....."
"Nice hotel, located just next to Pavilion Mall, and very near to Bintang Walk (in fact it is located along Jalan Bukit Bintang.  Easily can find food nearby, shopping, entertainment, etc.  Complimentary parking if you are driving.  If you are not, MRT station is just nearby, 5-minute walking distance."
"I had a very enjoyable staycation at Pavilion Hotel KL. There is a dedicated area for parking, sharing same entrance as the mall's carpark, so no issues with parking. Due to covid-19 restrictions, only one dedicated lift to the lobby, do a quick temperature scan and changing lifts to the reception.   I was allowed early check in at 1pm, so grateful as we can settle down in the room with the kids before heading out for lunch. Check in was quick and straightforward. Your keycard is needed to head to your floor so good additional security there.   I had a corner room, so it was much larger and will fit a baby cot well (was also provided by the hotel as I requested online). The room is very well lit, good amenities, and clean. Like they have capsule coffee instead of the normal"

Very pleasant experience. Excellent room and clean. Staffs were very helpful. Good working culture. Breakfast was delightful. Easy excess to Pavillion shopping mall. A short walking distance to Bukit Bintang area.
Amazing & splendid experience we had with Pavilion hotel! From nice welcoming gesture to the best service & treatment from each of the staffs! The only thing need to improve is the Kiblat signage for the muslim is preferable that will help us to perform our prayers.

"Hotel forgot about my request for a bathtub, upgraded my club room to a studio. Overall am satisfied with the facilities. Bit disappointed with lack of food varieties for the afternoon cocktails. The club facilities is also lacking vs Shangrila and Hilton."
"I must say that Pavilion Hotel is one of the best hotel that i‚Äôve ever stay;locally & internationally.Impeccable service throughout the hotel.The Courtyard is one of the best place to dine in.Reasonable price with premium & highest standard of foods,pleasant crews;Mr Maideen,Mr Sasi,Ms Esca,Afiq,Nazrin,Sharma,Kirthi,Ridwan (few names that i remembered).

A big Thank you to Wan who made our Family Birthday celebration in Pavilion Hotel so special for this 2020 year. Wan is very knowledgeable on Pavilion Hotel products yet pleasant & hardworking staff.

"This is my first time staying and I love this place so much. Value for money with the services provided. Convenient to stay if one is planning to shop in Pavilion or the areas in Bukit Bintang. One feels safe and comfortable at all time. I will definitely stay here whenever I'm in KL from now on. Great staff, right from the moment one step into the hotel. Excellent people are running this place definitely."

"Really 5 star quality hotel experience. From the concierge up to the management, everything was excellent. Had a really nice breakfast. Lots of choices and variety to choose from. Easy access to the Pavilion Mall."
"As this is not our 1st stay here, our expectation has been benchmarked. This was just a short staycation to curb our boredom and to help stir local industries affected by the pandemic. We were pleasantly surprised by the dedication of the hotel front liners. All staff has been limited mostly to local workforce and they have step up the service beyond my expectation. In fact not only the service at the front desk, the security, housekeeping and the restaurant personnel. Our short stay took an sharp sweet turn with an uncompromising professional service from Mr Alli, ensuring our stay was a memorable one...and it did! A big thanks to the whole team"
The hotel is located right in the heart of bukit bintang area. There are few shopping malls are just around the corner. Very convenience for shoppers as many retails and wide range of F & B to choose too. Hotel staffs are friendly. Foods wise in the hotel its good too.
"When you step in until you step out of the hotel, everything is superb! Staff is friendly, room is so spacious and food was extremely good. Definitely will come back. Thank you for the warm hospitality !"
Fantastic stay and service from the team. Big shout out to duty manager for her hospitality and swift response from her team to repair faulty aircond in my room.   They made our stay comfortable and safe. Kudos to hotel for following covid-19 SOP in accordance to government requirements.   Will definitely return and spread the words to my friends.  Keep up the good work teamüëç
"I have to say that this is the very best hotel in Kuala Lumpur with wonderful hospitality especially most wonderful and very dedicated Mr. Aslin from Reception. Breakfast service and their food is seriously great. Great location. Shopping experience just next to the hotel, with best boutique and store in town.  Just one word, FABULOUS HOTEL."
"From check in, rooms to breakfast the hotel team never fail to amazed you with their excellent service. Good for value if you are looking for a short getaway for yourself or family. Definitely will come back again!"
"Most of the 5 star hotel are more or less the same, it is the people working inside that makes it a different. This hotel provides excellent personal service in something really small like activate the escalator before you step on it, press the lift for you etc, truly can tell the management has provided the staff with 5 star hospitality training. We enjoyed our short stay and many shopping trip to the nearby shopping mall. Thanks."
Great warm service all over the hotel and great bed too! Overall satisfaction and value for money. This must be your selection for shopping because direct access to Pavillion mall. The food was great and reasonable pricing. Must try is Dulang Grill and Panda Gula Melaka Cream Br√ªl√©e.
"Covid-19 sop managed very well ,great hospitality and food is very delicious.Great place for business meeting and staycation as well.everything well managed and the service is tiptop from check in toward check out."

"Is a short staycation, Overall, the hotel is clean and comfortable and the staffs are delivering their true hospitality service. Few super star to recognize, Racheal and Juhairi from Front Office. Anita from F&B, keep up your great service üòä. Thank you."
Had the perfect staycation with friends at the Pavilion Hotel. The location is excellent with a direct connection to the Pavillion Mall and we literally didn't leave the hotel and mall for 3 days. Check-in was smooth with our friendly receptionist Racheal and the room and amenities were top-notch. Special mention to the housekeeping staff who went all the way to get me a bigger pair of in-room slippers and accommodated my request for extra coffee. The breakfast spread was scrumptious and we truly enjoyed the east meets west menu.   Thank you for our wonderful time and can't wait to be back again!
"Book a studio room with lounge benefits,  however it was facing the contructions side, a bit noisy during day time.  I like the bathtub with the view, however the view is just normal. I always collect hotel's slipper during every stay, however it is charged at 75 ringgit here if you wish to take home the used slipper. I am not sure if the hotel will recycle my used slipper, since i didnt buy it.  The lounge is close during pandemic, however, i can still enjoy the coffee at normal dining outlet. I don really like the high carb food during cocktail hours, then i requested some cheese to pair with my red wine, service is good. I request to extend late check out for one hour due to heavy rain, however it was rejected.  This hotel is managed by Banyan Tree, not really a Banyan Tree"
"Had a wonderful stay at the Pavilion Hotel Kuala Lumpur last week with friends. Service was top notch. Location is just right where you need to be at the centre of Kuala Lumpur. Special mention to Rachael and Atiqah who assisted me with the check-in and check-out procedure. Attentive service at the courtyard (breakfast) from Hanif, Afiq and Sonia who greets you by your name. Breakfast selection was scrumptious. Gym equipment were adequate. Unfortunately, did not try out the infinity pool as it was closed due to movement control order.   A special thank you to Ms Nurul (telephone operator) who assisted me with my room service order and Mr Dhambar, the friendly security officer who I met at the lobby, tasked to take your temperature before you are allowed up to the 8th floor."
"Pavillion Hotel, KL  The evening cocktail has been moved to Courtyard due to pandemic. For elite members, the evening cocktail is served from 5.30pm to 7.30pm with food in tiffins. Overall the finger food was freshly prepared, it is warm and they are all served in tiffins. Although each table is offered a set but they offered us more upon request. We have also requested for satays which was not in the normal serving and we got it too. Overall, we are satisfied with the food served and the services however the alcohol list is a bit boring, only beer (Asahi, 1664, etc) and limited wines are available.   As for the room, we are upgraded to Grand Oasis corner room, and it‚Äôs quite a large room with full window panel overseeing Jalan Bukit Bintang and Menara118.   Conclusion : The"

"It was a very good decision; We enjoyed the peace and quiet we needed, very high quality offered in all the facilities of your gorgeous hotel. This definitely added to the excellent service of the staff in every segment of your hotel.  Every staff member (especially Esca, Anita, Bob & Razif) with whom we came in contact was attentive and kind. In addition, the amazing food especially during Afternoon Tea, service and accommodations which made our staycation even better.  I just wanted to let you know how much we valued that effort, how impressive and gracious and how greatly we appreciate everything that you personally and your staff did for us. We have always a great time staying at Pavilion Hotel and loved the property."

"I was staying at Pavilion Hotel for 3days and 2nights, if you were to ask me how was it? I would answer you by saying that it was absolutely amazing. I stayed in their Grand Oasis and it was splendid. The room was huge, love the view, everything. When I arrived at the hotel, I‚Äôve receive warm greetings from each staff that I encountered with. Steven assisted me with the check in and it was fast and smooth. I was staying alone therefore I really appreciate the fact that I received calls from the FO staff specifically Nishant, Emily, and Jocelyn asking if I‚Äôm alright and checking up on me.  In the middle of the night throughout my whole stay when I was getting a bit hungry, thought of ordering something to eat and was worried that I might bother those who were working at the Guest"
Staff friendly and helpful. Thanks housekeeping team for the birthday deco room. And also to Courtyard kitchen team for the suprise cake and birthday song. Best stay. Love the infinity pool but unfortunately we cant use it due to CMCO in KL. But overall im satisfied!
A hotel that follow 100% CMCO SOP for safer & stress-free stay.  This is very important at this peak season of Covid-19 cases which had reported higher after 1st MCO announced.  We had pressure in finding an excellent hotel especially traveling with children. We need to consider all essential aspect from food to environment and crowd around.
"Booked a staycation at this hotel, as accor platinum member i got full elite recognitions. room upgrade, early check in, late check out, free breakfast, all day refreshment and cookies, evening cocktail.  Received status point in my accor account within hours after check out.  Their all day dining restaurant, The Courtyard, serving good buffet at very attractive price, good spread of choices.   Their daily afternoon tea is highly recommended. They served MALAYSIAN afternoon tea, with several types of ""kueh"", ""roti bakar with kaya"", ""nasi lemak"", ""teh tarik"", and desserts. Taste really authentic, really ""kampung"" feel, made me miss my hometown a lot.    Service in restaurant is another highlight, very attentive service. Thanks to Olivia, Maideen and Nazrin for taking care of us"
All the staff are friendly and the rooms are clean. Overall experience with the hotel is good. I will visit again in the future. Keep up the good work and hope the hotel will have more promotions in year 2021.
"I stayed 3 night, the location is good - nice city view, close to KL city center and linked to Pavilion shopping mall. Room was in very good condition and clean. Breakfast quality is high, but not so many choices."
It is a great place to stay if you plan to visit KL. It‚Äôs very convenient to go to Pavilion mall and other places around the mall. My friend and I very enjoyed the trip with Pavilion hotel. People were nice. I‚Äôd like to stay at this hotel next time if I visit KL.
"Such a minimalist environment you have in PH. Quite systematic arrangements without any complex bureaucracy procedure. Another sides of it, the most complement part is your staff relationship with his customers. Special thanks to steven, nadiah, syasya and afif"
"Arrive at 1pm something, the FO staff provide me the early check in and fulfill my requested to free upgrade to Grand Oasis. The room is comfortable, the bathroom comes along with bathtub. The breakfast is delicious. The chef make perfect omelets. All staff is superb friendly and kind. I really enjoy my stay and in future I will return back."
"The hotel is conveniently located within the same building as the Pavillion mall; with an accesible stairway to/fro the Couture wing. The hotel spa was not available, although u can book spa treatment at the Banyan Tree Spa across the road. The swimming pool has infinity pool- 1.2meter depth with no wading pool for kids. Breakfast spread was so-so although pastries were delicious. We had great time at the Pavillion Hotel!"
"Pavillion Hotel is one of the best hotel in town, thanks to Ms Chloe and the rest of the front counter team for the excellent service and attentive on replying my emails and during the checkin process.  The parking entrance is on the left of the building and you need to pass by the second barrier gate for the hotel parking and the reception is on the 8th floor. Pavillion Mall can be access at the 1M level  The Club room was clean and comfort with a view of Pullman and Banyan Tree and  a big screen tv with selection of in house and astro channels. The only problem is our basin tab but it was successful settle by the maintenance team.   the buffet breakfast was great with a variety of foods, Malaysian hi-tea set also great and it comes with a set of fried mee, currypuff, kuih and"
"Good size room, perfect location, great hospitality, decent breakfast spread, however, pool is a tad small with no kids pool, gym is good only thing to complain is the multiple lift exchange that we have to make, would be better if there's a direct lift to the lobby/room as it was a bit of a hassle for family with small children, other than that, it was a good stay!"
"Our last minute staycation plan in KL for my husband's birthday turned out to be worth it. We have been warmly greeted by Mr Alli upon arrival and were able to check-in early and smoothly.    Once Mr Alli aware of the occasion for our stay, he immediately offered for a complimentary room upgrade and arranged for wonderful birthday deco, cake and card later that day. It really made our day.  To summarize our review of the hotel: -Spotless room with great view. -Direct access to Pavilion mall. -Ample free parking spaces. -Polite, helpful and attentive staffs. -Breakfast selection was limited yet delectable. üòã  Pavilion Hotel would definitely be our top choice for our next staycation. Highly recommended!"
"This was not our first staycation but it was our first time-off together post Malaysian‚Äôs Movement Control Order and hence the chance to experience the usually not-in-our-budget-kind-of-hotel. The reason we decided on this hotel was because it was one of the top-ranking hotels in Kuala Lumpur that is connected to a shopping mall.  The hotel was listed as a 5-star hotel and they proved that to us even before we checked in. Upon finishing the online booking for the hotel, we received a few emails from the hotel inquiring us about things that we expected from them for our stay and information that they could utilize to treat us better during the staycation.  Parking is available as both basement and valet service. As for the basement parking, the entrance is just a little bit"

"Many thanks to all staff for making our stay so memorable. We are moving back to Australia after living in Malaysia for almost 7 years. The staff were obliging at all times. Special mention to Olivia, Dora and Esca in the restuarant. Larry in lobby/ luggage service. Great Hotel"
"Mr Alli promptly attended to us the moment we stepped in, check in process was brilliant by him and all staff from every department were excellent throughout our stay : friendly and helpful. Cleanliness of the room is perfect! Credit to the housekeeping team. The bathroom and the shower is very pleasant and we slept very well. Soundproofing is great too!   As our package come with breakfast, firstly we would like to thanks the crew for their awesome hospitality. But just need a light improvement on the Koay Teow, other than that it was perfect!   Anyway keep up the good work and i can't wait for my next visit on 11sept2020 üëçüèªüëçüèª"
"Very easy to access mall,clean,my room view excellent.Breakfast very good.Even during Covid-19 situation, They served us alacarte breakfast with great food.All the staff are very friendly.I love my room.Our bathroom so big,My kid love the bathtub."
"Large, clean bedroom, impeccable service, super convenient access to the Pavilion Shopping Mall, there's not much else you can ask for from this package!!   Had a great Merdeka weekend with my girlfriend in this hotel, and will definitely be back here again"
"Good location and the staff members were courteous and super helpful. The most outstanding ""Steven & Chloe"". The rooms were also clean and nice, but a bit dusty. Slightly disappointed on the link to Pavilion mall it due to RMCO, as we need to walk away from outside back to the hotel.  The foods not up to the expectation, especially the room dining which ordered by my both children.   Bathroom: Spacious but I have noticed a burnt smell in the bathroom that reminds me most of cigarette smoke."
