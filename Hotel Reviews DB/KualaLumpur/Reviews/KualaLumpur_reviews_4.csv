"I stayed for a night with my husband. As we reached the level 1 we were greeted with a very warm welcome and wonderful services by the staffs. Upon reaching the lobby at level 53, we were again greeted at the opening of the lift by the staffs who made us feel very welcome. The room haf great view of KL Tower the toilet was exquisite. One major point i would like to highlight was that we visited during ramadhan. But our experience was not lacking in any ways. We were very Happy with the services that they provided for us, instead of breakfast we were given a menu for sahur instead. Which was not any less. It was served on time and very properly handled. Andeverything about the hotel was beautiful. Attached in the photos were our sahur spread. Can‚Äôt wait to come back again with"
"One of the best hotel we‚Äôve stayed! Received a call few hours before check-in, made sure everything was in order and ask if there‚Äôs special occasion. So we told them it was for a birthday and to our surprise when we enter the room, they did go to the extend of decorating the room with birthday banner, even  prepared chocolate cake on the table! All in all, it was perfect, room was spacious and love the design of our room, plus it was scented with essential oil! Hospitality exceeded our expectations. Special thanks to Iqa & team for the great experience! Will definitely be returning to Banyan Tree again and again!"
"Everything about Banyan is the best. The best hotel ever so far. Excellent room, service, food, hotel utilities, swimming pool, the view. 5-star hotel as it's said. Worth the money and will definitely go again. Kudos Banyan team"
"located right next to pavilion mall, only had to walk for 2 min :) we went for anniversary and they prepared a small complimentary cake for us! service was great, horizon grill and vertigo was worth the view. our room's bathtub had a slight leaking issue, but did not bother since we were staying for one night. still, totally recommend!"
Great environment with excellent staffs. Superb service during our stay. They even went an extra mile to decorate our room for birthday celebration without requesting. The breakfast was great too. Recommended for a break away from busy work life.
"A very pleasant stay in Banyan Tree KL. It‚Äôs a staycation to celebrate my hubby‚Äôs birthday. The room is well prep with the birthday decor and a piece of birthday cake was in the room upon our checkin. Managed to make a last minute arrangement for dinner at Horizon Grill and they were helpful to reserve a table for us. Food served were delicious and thanks to the restaurant crews for the good service and recommendations on food. Special thanks to Myna, she attended to our queries promptly. She has also advised us to be early for breakfast the next day, as the hotel was fully booked! We took her advice seriously... haha, we did have a good breakfast time the next day."
I‚Äôm so happy with their services. A big thanks to Munir & Chef Barani for assisting us. The food arrangement and explanation was clear and understandable. We enjoy all the meal and it was so delicious. Surely we will come back here! Tq..
"Big thank you to Emily & Ranston for the special arrangement which turned out perfect! Warm welcome upon arrival by Remco, Nishant, Frankie, Sharon & Bhavani. Felt very much like home as they greet their guests by their name. The room was spacious and unlike any other hotels in KL with a lovely tub facing the KL city view. Big thumbs up to the housekeeping team, the room was pristine. Was greeted by the lovely decor and the husband was more than happy. Thank you, Shikin (Housekeeping) for the turndown service and the warm bubble bath prepared after a long shopping day.   Things that can be improved from the whole stay experience will be the breakfast. Love the wide spread to choose from, however, food was wee bit slow as my husband‚Äôs nasi lemak arrived first and my eggs benedict"
Celebrated my wife‚Äôs birthday at Horizon Grill. The food was spot on and the view was simply amazing. The staff was friendly and helpful. Shout out to Mr Hanif Adenan for making the occasion truly memorable.
"We ordered 3 main course ( Lobster aglio olio, Agus sirloin steak and Chicken kampung). All satisfied but, for lobster aglio olio its too pricey and not expected as the menu. Hope u can improve that foods. But, u have a very friendly staff ( hanie)."
"Nice ambience, nice food and friendly staff. A big shout out to Hanie who served our table!! Great KL night view and perfect place for nice photo as well!!!Had a great birthday dinner here, really recommendedüëçüèª‚ù§"
"Since the pandemic, I've had the opportunity to book weekend staycations at the Banyan Tree KL at least quarterly.  Since all of the guestrooms and suites occupy three of the highest floors (53A, 55 and 56), I will always have unobstructed and unparalleled views of the city skyline. When I stay in the Sky Suite, I'm treated to having a 270-degree view of the city.  Naturally, you have the best views at the rooftop bar, Vertigo. However, I really enjoyed this last visit because I had the opportunity to enjoy dining and drinking at its newest space, Vertigo TOO, which is one level up from Vertigo.  My friend and I appreciated having the whole space almost exclusively to ourselves.  And, I'm always impressed with the consistent service excellence from the staff at the front desk,"
"Took my wife for dinner to celebrate our 14th wedding anniversary and was absolutely delighted with the experience. Ambience was just lovely and staff kept to infection control protocols well. The view was surprisingly great with both KLCC and KL towers being so near and capturable in the same photo. The food was superb, matched only by the excellent service provided by our waiter Erwan. The team even surprised us with complimentary dessert in light of our anniversary. Thank you Horizon, Banyan Tree for a wonderful evening! From K&N."
"April 2021 marked the third years anniversary trip with my fiancee to banyan, not started well but ended perfectly well. The first trip to banyan was for proposal.  We had a delayed for our in room dining service and in the end we got foc of the meals. The next day morning the manager even waited our arrival and apologise again.   Not to forget to mention the in room dining foods all are very tasty also the breakfast I already missed my delicious Hainannese chicken rice.  Banyan always stays a special place in our heart It gives us a feeling of going back to somewhere warm and nice. The most valuable in banyan is the people and I already cannot wait for my next fourth trip to stay in banyan"
"We went for our wedding anniversary and we surprised by a banner and balloons in the room along with a wonderfully tasty piece of chocolate cake. As we walked into the room the first thing we saw was the fantastic view of the city skyline, being on the 54th floor, as one side of the room was a floor to ceiling window. The room was specious and had all the necessary amenities including a hers and his bathrobe, kimono and slippers. The bed was also very comfortable and so was the cozy sofa area from which we enjoyed a nice cup of tea watching the amazing view change color. The bathroom has a large oval bathtub which also has a view of the skyline. We had dinner at Vertigo on the 59th floor watching the sunset and enjoying the breeze. Breakfast was on the 58th floor and we sat"
Did a little staycation and enjoyed the pampering and attention of the Banyan Tree staff. Room wasn‚Äôt quite ready upon arrival but staff more than made up for it. Banyan Tree spa was excellent and vertigo rooftop bar is a must see
We love the teh tarik here for bfast and I personally repeated the steak & eggs for 3x. Steaks for bfast is gonna be my new fav. Amanda & Syamim are very attentive and the service is 5 star. Definitely gonna repeat our stay here in the future.
"The best hotel and excellent service & attentive especially to FO teams, Ms Chloe and Bryan. Fast check-in and we was served a special tea while waiting for our room key. Our Sky Suite room 5516 was so comfort and clean with a stunning view of KLCC, KL Tower and Merdeka PNB 118 tower. Breakfast was served at the Horizon Grill Restaurant and we love the food. Free parking at the Basement and connected to Pavilion Mall via bridge. We also had our light meals at The Altitude Restaurant and Mr Nawi was so friendly to serve us. we love the service, food and stay at Banyan Tree and definitely will come back again."
"When we decided on a staycation in KL, we never expected that Banyan Tree to have such an excellent and attentive service. I guess the good thing is that they only have 55 rooms on 3 floors and they are able to pay more special attention to their guests.  The rooms were exceptional as well with a lot of modern elements. There was even a daily essential oil and incense sticks service to make the experience unique.  Truly loved it here and highly recommended for a staycation."
"One restaurant with 3 tallest buildings in KL Views. KLCC, Twin Tower, TRX.   I usually go to 53rd floor Altitude for meeting. and 58th Vertico for gathering and Horizon for dinner. It‚Äôs great place to spend time with love one.  In life, it‚Äôs relationships and memories that matter."
"They do care  of every guest, making us feel like home. A 5 stars staycation that shouldn‚Äôt  miss. Even during peak season, they make reasonable and smart arrangement to make you don‚Äôt suffer from the waiting time and enjoy the golden hour spent with family and loved one."
"Thank you for making this a remarkable experience for me. I had an enjoyable birthday celebration at Banyan Tree Horizon Grill with surprise decorations and a complimentary dessert. The warm hearted and detailed service staffs, perfected food and lovely ambience also made my day. Satisfied with the staffs who served me - Amanda and Norhafiz."
"Special shout out to the Horizon Grill team Cheong, Munir, and chefs for their amazing dedication to delighting guests with their culinary skills while adhering to the SOP's ensuring the safety and well-being of guests. Thank you for the surprise! Also thank you for the warm and caring hospitality!"
Dinner gathering with whole team at Horizon Grill went well! Kudos to excellent team service by Munir. Excellent hospitality by Cheong for organising our dinner! And credit also to chef and team for nice food! But not least really nice view from Banyan Tree.
"This is probably the best restaurant in KL for special occasions. I came here with my wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary and her birthday. We really enjoyed our time here and had a blast. The food was superb, plus we were entertained by super friendly, super professional staffs Hanif & Mina. We had lobster and steak, both were out of the world. The view is also great, you get to see the whole of KL (KLCC,KL Tower, TRX, and the whole of KL‚Äôs skyline from this 58th floor restaurant. I highly recommend anyone looking for great food and memorable experience to come here and enjoy!"
"Hubby took me here Horizon Grill to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday. This is actually our first time here and it exceeds our expectations im glad he made the arrangements. Hospitality was top notch especially from Haniff and Myna,the food is great; the steak was probably one of the best we‚Äôve ever had and the view of KLCC and the city from here were spectacular. We had a great time here, we feel absolutely welcomed and we will definitely come again. Thank you so much for your great service and food."
I love the servise here in this hotel . All staff very good . They are very friendly . And today before check out we having breakfast and one of staff ( hanif adenan ) serve our breakfast . Thank you so much . We really love servise in this hotel ü•∞
Excellent & attentive customer service! Good quality food with nice ambience. Special shoutout to Ms Amanda & Mr Hanif for the warm hospitality :)   Definitely worth to come back here for another round of feast.
"Definitely a 5 star hotel with great treatments. I celebrated my birthday at the hotel with a decorated room complimentary from the hotel. The bathtub is a plus point with view. Room is fine and I especially love the incense in room, it embodies the banyan tree spirit of relaxing and enjoyment. Just one thing, my night sleep was disturb because I couldn‚Äôt find the switch off button for my bed head lamp. It was dimmed but not off. I knew there‚Äôs always a master switch to off all lights, but not this one, weird. Been searching high and low for the switch off button, perhaps next time I should call the reception where‚Äôs the switch off panel for it. Other than that everything is definitely a 5 star. Not to mention the magnificent view on top floor. One of the best KL view offered"
"Good service, all staff is really polite, kind and helpful. The room is super clean, bed is super comfy and i love the bath tub by the window. The view is stunning to enjoy at night thru vertigo. The food is good at Horizon Grill. Truly amazing stay definitely will comeback. Highly recommend!!"
"Good service and delicious food with nice KLCC view Good imbiance with lightning... All staff very very kind and helpful..  Thanks Shafiq, firdaus and Iwan provided good service we very enjoying tonight Cocktial very very nice made by Shafiq............."
"We had a great dinner at the Horizon Grill! Food was good and ingredients are fresh. We will definitely return to dine in again. Thank you Hanif for leading the team with great hospitality service. Amanda and Shafiq are both very attentive to the guests, same to the rest of the staff. #kitajagakita. Well done and cheers!"
"The view is stunning to enjoy early morning breakfast with highly attentive staff. Had a great breakfast here and will definitely comeback. Selection of menus are broad, the taste is awesome completed with great ambience"
"Had drinks at the bar before dinner.. We were well greated and informed of the menu and availability. The waiters were attentive and professional.The Lobster bisque was exceptional with hearty chunks of lobster and everything else was well executed! Not to mention dining with a view does heighten the experience! We ended the dinner with delicious desserts and coffee! They have decaf.   Despite several birthday celebration, all were given enough attention and enthusiasm."
"From check in till check out process seamless. Celebrating my son‚Äôs birthday, room was decorated with balloons and even cakes been provided during the check in. The restaurant Horizon Grill food and services are top notch. Will definitely revisit."
"Food was very good. The steak was nicely done. I was served by Myna and Munir. Very good service, very attentive. Would definitely recommend to friends and family and would definitely come back here soon!"
"Short vacation in banyan tree Kuala Lumpur. Was great place and beautiful city with lovely view from root top and great shopping experience in pallvion and KLCC thru the bridge link from hotel ...Good staff,polite and friendly, service provider was taste and excellent...tqvm for everything..Will come back soon..."
"I would like to express my appreciation for the quality of service you offered us though it's a late post üôè. I also would like to thank the team that made our birthday ü•≥üéÇ arrangements special and stay a good time, comforting and secure. The place is absolutely stunning with top design üè®, the real taste of Banyan Tree family. The location is so perfect it's just that best malls are right next to your door steps. I will definitely recommend Banyan Tree KL hotel to friends and family.  See you soon.‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
"Service is distinguishingly different here. Friendly staff greet you from the parking lot (no kidding!) and all the way to the restaurant, in this case it was Horizon Grill.  The friendly staff continued in Horizon, where if you order steak, then an array of knives are presented for you to choose your weapon against the meat! Unique!  Food was very good, but the view was excellent. It was a clear night and the top floors of the KL Twin Towers were in ""touching distance"". You could see the edges of the city where the light changes to darkness.  Munir, Erwan and Ash were outstanding in their respective roles. Well done, boys!  Come for the food, enjoy the service and stay for the view. Perfect!"
Decided to stay 1 night for my birthday. They given room with KL tower view which is beautiful. Room was decorated with birthday banner and balloons. They sent the cake after checked in. Thanks for the arrangement. Service need improvement though. From housekeeping to restaurant and bar. Should be more attentive especially at the restaurant. Overall it was good stay.
"If there is 6/5 rating, I would tap that for sure. My stay was personalised according to my preference, unexpectedly. Thank you very much for the kueh gesture. Love the kueh talam a lot.   I indulged every moments being in the room, just like being in a sanctuary. Spotless clean and staff service, excellent!   Wish that I can use the pool but there were still restriction back then. An indication for me to staycation again I presumed.   I used the gym and It was sufficient. It is understandable with the sizing, it caters most of the prominent workouts needed.   I enjoyed being in Horizon Grill alone. Either lunch or dinner, both serves the best state of the art dining for you to experience.   Lastly,Mr Hanif Adenan, huge thank you for catering our inputs and deliver an"
"We have our lunch at Ebisu Banyan, the foods served are definitely value for money. We order the Omakase Set and Seafood set, sashimi are fresh, portion are just nice.The service provided is excellent, thanks again to Mr Chef and also server Mr Nawi. Definitely we will come again next time"
"Check-in: Check in process was a breeze and you are treated like a VIP. You will be seated at a comfortable seating area while your check-in agent does the needful and brings everything to you, including a serving of tea.  The Room: The room was beautiful, clean and upscale. Everything is provided, from comb to toothbrush, from shoe mitt to shoe horn, two sets of shower robes in towel and Japanese style. A shower with different modes - rain, shower, pouring, mist. A bathtub that fits 2 and bath salts are provided. Lots of bottled drinking water are provided as well. The bed is super comfortable, King size, with different lighting controls (work, rest, sleep). The toilet has a bidet that automatically opens the cover when it detects movement.  Breakfast: Buffet breakfast was not"
The location is very strategic for New Year Celebration to capture the stunning glimpse of KL skyline. Spacious room and well-appointed bathroom. Aroma burner was provided in the room with a variety choices of essential oil (by request) for you to scent your room which definitely enhance my staying experience.
"From exceptional guest service to a wonderful stay, everything was perfect. Special mention to Chloe from front desk was very friendly and attentive to us. It‚Äôs truly a remarkable experience as you received such service when you stepped into the hotel and she has made it very welcoming for us. Breakfast was amazing! Ezreen was very helpful and attentive too! Food is delicious, view was stunning. Housekeeping staff Sagar was indeed very quick and very efficient in his job. Set-up for the birthday banner and making up the bed very tidy and quick. Polite and friendly. Special mentions to those who have made our stay unforgettable and well done to everyone too! Guest service to room cleanliness and stay, you‚Äôve made it very memorable for us. Thank you and Keep up the wonderful"
Such a great staycation for my post birthday treats. A warmest wishes and decorations provided was truly made me feel how blessed my life was. Truly appreciate the kindest gesture and great hospitality provided by the hotel. Highly recommended Hotel!
I booked the property for a staycation with my mom to celebrate my birthday. Love the room‚Äôs layout and love the bathtub by the window. The room is very comfortable and clean. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we are happy. Highly recommend!
Everything is perfect and spotless! It‚Äôs the place where u feel welcomed and get the best treatment. They addressed you by name throughout the stay. Food is great too! The bath tub overlooking KL view is also a highlight. The spacious bathroom witn combined with the powderroom is a convenient for us
My family and I absolutely enjoyed spending our annual new year‚Äôs dinner at Horizon Grill. The diverse menu catered to everyone‚Äôs preference and the excellent service created a very comfortable setting for a very memorable night. - SHA‚ÄôIN
"What a marvelous place to celebrate for new year. Especially during a pandemic, they handled the event pretty well following sop and social distancing. Big thank you to Lee see who took care of everything. We even booked 1 night stay in the hotel and 2 night celebrating in vertigo because of her outstanding service. She is very experienced in handling customers and multitasking. Every customer She served was satisfied and happy."
"Overall, we enjoyed the stay, everything was good and the service was superb. The location is so strategic and there is an linked bridge to Pavilion.  Love the idea of no buffet breakfast and keep to a-la-carte to mitigate the risk of close contacts. I hope this can be maintained as buffet is wasting food.  Pool is nice and clean. The gym room is clean as well.  Overall, superb and Thank you Banyan Tree KL."
"I can‚Äôt imagine how almost perfect the banyan tree is. The employees service is passion, friendly and professional. The environment is comfortable plus the location is consider the best since it‚Äôs close to paviliony. Can‚Äôt wait to go again in the future"
"The Hotel is well maintained but it is the people that is making the difference. Everyone from the front desk to the restaurant, they never fail smile and ask if everything was ok. Always looking to please the customer and trying to make it better. Kudos."
The room was clean and the view from the room was absolutely awesome. The check in & check out process was fast. You can enjoy your breakfast at the rooftop of the building and at the same time enjoy the beautiful KL city view in the morning.
"Service was very good. Room was clean and with a good view. Staff were friendly and courteous. The resort in a city experience is something unique to the hotel, and it was definitely a great choice for a staycation."
"Perhaps the best hotel experience in KL. Highly recommended for those who wish to experience the best services a Hotel can offer. Walking distance from great Malls like Pavilion and KLCC Suria, Banyan Tree has excellent amneties. Look forward for my next stay in the hotel."
"It was nice and comfortable staying. Luxury room with wonderful KL tower view, very kind staffs, delicious breakfast, good connection to Pavilion mall, etc. It was just great staycation! I want to visit again! :)"
"Everything was perfect, from the check in, to the check out. The staff was really polite and friendly. However, the only down fall was just the mini bars that we have to pay for most of the items, as some hotels are complimentary with the premium price that we have to pay.   The breakfast ala carte buffet was lovely, and the service speed was good despite heavy crowd flow.   Definitely will visit again!"
Overall was good especially the room condition and design. Just need a little improvement on food quality (breakfast and in-room servings). Tastes were average and did not hit the mark. Looking forward to seeing improvements on that.
"I booked room with about rm700,the booking was for my proposal to my gf,before check in,been request to pay rm100 decorations fees,its fair enough. Before check out,i purposely call guest service,ask about should i clean the stickiness that left by candle,replied with they will take care of it. I checked out and been request to pay for Rm300 cleaning fees and this leave me a very stress situation because my fiance so disatisfied and angre of this.  So thats my feeling,everything in good and ends in not perfect ending."
"be understand of every customer, veru good service, but still can make improvement, and did not any recommendation of facilities, for first customers is quite no enough to discovery, but everything is good."
"I had my one in a lifetime exprerience in Horizon Grill for my wedding proposal. Special thanks to Ezreen, Munir, Firdaus, and Chef Daniel for assisting me in this special occation for me.  Really deserved a five star rating!"
"We had been upgraded to sanctuary sky suite and that is really amazing view of KL Tower and KLCC in every spot of the room and including the jacuzzi in the room. Hotel service is great, location is very good that just a 1 min walk to Pavilion shopping mall."
"Prompt and attentive service from Arianna prior to staying at Banyan Tree Kuala Lumpur with her fulfilling my every request pertaining to my room via email and dropping me a courtesy call before my check in date to ensure that every detail is well taken care off.   Upon check in, Min Chen was very friendly and efficient and even took it upon herself to arrange Felly as a surprise for me during turndown service when I offhandedly mentioned it due to having stayed with the Banyan Tree Group before. She was also very detailed in explaining all the hotel facilities and room amenities.   Hari and Charles were very charming, helpful and friendly throughout my short staycation at the hotel.   Upon check out, Chloe was efficient in ensuring that it was a smooth process.   Kudos to the"
"Thank very much sir norhafiz for suggest this place for me to celebrate with my love one, i would love to say thank you ms Ezreen & team for serving us with polite and neat. The service and was great and delicious i will definitely will come again next time."
"This hotel is definitely a five star hotel with great services. I went there for my bday celebration and was given free upgrade as I purchased the sanctuary package. It is clean, comfortable and convenient in accessing pavilion mall by walking over the link bridge."
The most satisfying hotel and place i‚Äôve ever stay for leisure..staff all nice..food was so good..swimming pool area superb view..they take note all your request..they entertain you like all day untill check out..
"Every year, I will look for a hotel stay to celebrate my wife's birthday. Bayan was chosen due to its low density and good review.  But when I was informed no table was available a day before for Hi-tea and dinner during our stay, I was disappointed and thought the stay would not be as planned.  During check-in, Nish managed to fulfill all requests by making reservations for Hi-tea and dinner.  His 'Can Do' attitude is very much appreciated.  Also, a BIG thank you to the team who decorated the room and prepared the hottub with Rose petals. To cut the story short, it was a memorable stay for us beside not so happy incidents during breakfast due to the service."
"My friends and I booked Banyan Tree during the October sale in order to celebrate one of our friend‚Äôs birthday and it was one of the best decisions made especially with a deal like that.  As we both booked the rooms separately, I have dropped a note to the Banyan Tree team to help plan a birthday surprise for my friend and they definitely lived up to expectations. The additional decor and special dessert provided made my friend‚Äôs stay so much better.  The rooms that we stayed in was amazing, facilities were great and the bathroom was wonderful. I just did not enjoy having the shower so close to the door, but that‚Äôs just a personal preference. The bathtub was divine and it‚Äôs one of the only few hotels with bathtubs with a view.   I also took the opportunity to have a massage and"
"Overall,Banyan Tree offers a more superior product than other 5 star operatirs in the area. Spa, Vertigo & Horizon were fabulous places to spend time in. Btw, there‚Äôs only 55 rooms but all immaculately appointed."
"Stayed on 18 Dec, room was clean, view was nice too for signature sky retreat room. Room also filled with aromatherapy essential oils. Breakfast was good too. Will be happy to stay again in future. All banyan tree staff is friendly and helpful too."
Perfect dining experience with excellent food and cozy environment! Chef Johnny special menu definitely is heart melted! The service is great and staff is very friendly. Will come for next visit for sure!
Chef Jonny Au Yong serves excellent Japanese foods and Khairy serves fantastic desserts. Best Japanese foods with tip top quality that I ever had in Malaysia. Strongly recommend Japanese foods lover to visit Ebisu. Service is awesome.
"Great experience staying at the Banyan Tree Hotel, pampered with Hi-Tea and Indulging at their prestige Horizon Restaurant (Famous for their viral Rm460 burger) which I think worth the food and ambiance for. No doubt its really a great experience and I would love to stay here again and again at this wonderful hotel. Room: Signature Suites"
One of the best Hotel i‚Äôd highly recommended to the readers. The services are top notch! We had an enjoyable and memorable stay in this Hotel. We love the breakfast and the breathtaking city view at different angles and directions both in the morning and evening from Vertigo and Horizon grill. We‚Äôll definitely return to stay in this wonderful hotel in future.
Food is very fresh and nice. Chef Johnny Au Yong is very friendly and serve us very well. He recommend the dishes to us and told us story behind the dishes. Salmon belly is especially remarkable. We enjoyed our time here.
"Am loving the top notch service at Banyan Kl. My second stay this time and most remarkable service than the first time. Memorable afternoon tea, breakfast at horizon grill is simply spectacular. Tried to get dinner at horizon grill but fully booked. At breakfast be ready to be mesmerised by Ezereen and Rose with their warm welcome, friendly service. Dinner at ebisu was whole other level having nawi to assist. Last but not least loving every bit of the spacious room, exciting shower room. Definitely coming back again"
"We came here to celebrate my wife birthday party. Our reservation was handled professionally, food (Pasta, Barramundi & wagyu tenderloin) taste excellent. Our server Myna took great care of us throughout our visit. Highly recommended for couples and family celebrating special occasions!"
"In short: I love the hotel and the services. But on to the real review, the cons first: I don't think the rooms are fully booked during our stay, but we did not get the room with KLCC view. The leftover breakfast that was supposed to go to our room also did not come. Pros: Location: Beside Pavilion and there is a walkway from the hotel to Pavi. Easy access. During arrival, we were served some kind of sparkling water or infused water. We had a staff greeting us and accompanying us to the rooms. We were attended to personally very well. The room were very nicely decorated and very homey yet luxury feeling. The only downside was not getting the klcc view as it would have made our trip much more memorable. We only had a one night stay but yet their service doesn't diminish. Our room"
"The hotel room was very clean, spacious and well maintained. The room amenities were sufficient and could cater for different categories of travellers. However the restaurant has limited tables and reservation is required especially on weekends."
"Weekend staycation at Sky Sanctuary Suite. The view from the room with bose sound system, amenities, staffs, breakfast, afternoon tea is simply superb! We had a wonderful time and my daughter loves it very much. We will definitely come again!"
"The best hotel, went to celebrate my son 4th year birthday.  - perfection - awesome - fantastic  - beautiful  - happiness  - lovely  - kindness  - caring - polite - 100% perfection   Thank you so much Banyan üòç"
Staffs are very attentive ! Absolutely an excellent hospitality.  Every needs and preference are taken care by their attentive staffs.  Value for money and the breakfast is one of the best of some of Accor hotels that I have stayed.
"This is our second stay and it was a great staycation. Firstly we need to thank all the staff as they were all very attentive and caring. We took the sky suite this round. Despite that the layout is a little weird, the day and night time views are marvellous. Basically u get to see all the landmarks. We enjoyed our stay and will be back for yet another staycation soon!"
The view was insanely good I love the room set up for my wife birthday  The breakfast was superbly great I love it so much  Make sure you try the altitude high tea session  Oh ya the bathtub in the room is amazing with its crazy view
Nawi has shown exemplary service to my family and I as his attitude was top notch and he was very friendly and attentive when we had our afternoon tea. This has truly made our day. Kudos to Nawi and Banyan Tree !
We book the sanctuary suite at banyan tree kk.Great hotel and view but was not happy with the check in and check out procedures handled by the staff. Other than that it was a great experience. Hopefully the management look into my feedback given to improve their services.
"Booked a table at Horizon Grill to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday. The food was nice and the service was great. All the staff Is very helpfull from the moment we steps in to Banyan Tree until we steps Out.   Special thanks to Roshidi, the duty Manager who recommended this place to celebrate my husband‚Äôs birthday. Great hospitality from Hanif and Shafiq. They were really helpfull and the service was excellence. Their service warm our heart. All other 5 stars hotel should learn from them how to manage guest‚Äôs expectation and to ensure the guest is well taken care of. All of the staff that we pass by approached us and ask if all was fine. I cant remember all the staff name but what can I say is from the doorman until their F&B Manager - Iskandar. Definetly will come back and"
"Very nice scenery, polite waiters and waitress, food is very nice. I would prefer their Australian Sirloin. Special thanks to the manager on duty, Mr. Hanif, waiter that bring us cake with birthday song, Shafiq and the gang, Farhana the hostess and to all. Very recommended place üëç"
"A great place for a short staycation in KL. The staffs were very friendly, attentive, and understanding. All of our requests were being fulfilled by the hotel. The spa treatment was amazing as well. Oh, they even give free aromatherapy for your room, according to the days but you can request your special favourite scents too! Definitely will come back again here!"
"Staff was very friendly and accommodating, great view from our room & wonderful breakfast! Really appreciate the handwritten birthday card I received as I told them I was celebrating my birthday during the stay. Thank you Banyan Tree Kuala Lumpur! :)"
Best hotel in KL. Great service. They even called days before check in to see if we have any specific request. We are celebrating my wife‚Äôs birthday so they help to decorate the room a little. The breakfast is also good. They even free rm100 credit when u book through their website. Will definitely book again soon

"Stayed at the Signature Banyan Retreat King for two nights at this hotel to escape from the mundane WFH. I did not regret the decision! Also, the best part was I got a special deal during the 11.11 sale.  What I like abt my stay: - Very spacious room with a great layout. Separate bidet toilet flows into wardrobe, powder room n lastly rain shower n bathtub area. A very big size bathtub ! - When I checked in, the welcoming officer (Chloe) brought me a tour of the room and explained the features i.e. what switch to turn on/off, how to use the coffee maker, explained different functions of rain shower etc. - Another feature that I like is their turndown service. At 6pm there will be housekeeping staff came to the room, light up the aromatherapy diffuser (they hv different scent each"
"Spent 2 days in Banyan for my birthday staycation. Everything were wonderful! The room were decorated and I got a complimentary piece of cake. Very spacious room, and I love the bathroom so much!  All hotel crew are very friendly and they very attentive.  The room and services provided is up to the 5star hotel standard. We will be happy to return in future."

"Very attentive staff, nice clean room, and the breakfast was wonderful despite no buffet allowed during the CMCO. It's a pity the pool facilities could not be used. Would return in the future. Good connection to Pavilion via the link bridge."

"The check in and arrangements done before arrival was attended to promptly and efficiently, ¬†and the front desk ppl were really helpful and friendly. Everyone was really nice and the room looked great. ¬†there were minor hiccups, housekeeping the next day was a bit sloppy and there seem to be a lack of ¬†follow through with some of the staff during breakfast as in forgotten orders etc. ¬†But the staff was really apologetic and it made me felt heard. But i am ok with most of that except for the reservation screw up that was made at Vertigo's. My reservation was cancelled despite being booked 2 days earlier in favour of walk-in guests. My family managed to get a table after much arguing but we only had an hour to be there as were not told of the closing time. So that was a fun"
