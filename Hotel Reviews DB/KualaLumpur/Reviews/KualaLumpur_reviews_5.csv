"Their hotel bed is hard, compare to other 5 star hotels where we previously checked in. We both experienced back pain when we woke up the next days. Not anymore recommended as 5 star. Other services and food are also out of merit."
Spend our staycation here for the weekend. Mandarin oriental definitely kept to it's name and showed us warm hospitality and service.  We were thrilled to when we were upgraded to a room with a view. Definitely made our anniversary stay here even sweeter.  The room was confused and overall the hotel has great updated  facilities.  The pool is slightly small but guess it's ok as it's a city hotel.  Breakfast was great...good spread of cuisines from different cultures. Taste were good as well.  Definitely worth our stay n made our 10th Anniversary very memorable.  Thank you MO.
I love the view of the room. Very good ambience and close to suria klcc. Just a waking distance. Even got a surprise birthday cake by the hotel. The choc cake is good as well. Thank you Michelle and Ying Thong!
"Stayed in the mandarin room for 2 nights during the weekdays. Hotel is conveniently located between klcc mall, convention center and klcc park. Room was very spacious n cosy, with a great view. Bed was very comfortable. They even provide a baby cot free of charge. Hotel staff was very courteous.  A few downsides : 1. late check in because our room was not ready by the time we got there at 4pm (check in time was at 3pm). Only got our room at 5pm. A simple call from the hotel to inform us of the late check in wouldve made a world of difference.  2. Room was not very clean. I expected the room to be spotless with all the sanitising due to covid. However we found traces of food around the room (under the couch, behind curtains).  3. We find the mattress for the baby cot a bit too"
"The staff so friendly and helpful. From the entrance to room service. I really appreciate the staff who serve our Dine in room service.  And we got a surprise cake for wedding anniversary from the hotel. Thanks to Mohana  Michelle, Sarah,  Nizam,  n Daniel. And thanks a lot to Jeannte at reception counter. You guys really give a great service."
"Reached at the hotel around 3pm, helped by bellboys for our 2 small luggages. They were very helpful and kind. When we wanted to check in, there were so many people around.   Most of them were waiting for their rooms to be ready. Luckily, our room was ready and just took 10 minutes for the checked in process and entertained by Ms Sofia. She is very nice and helpful in giving information.   The room was spacious, clean and tidy. Our room at level 14 was facing swimming pool and other 5-star hotels. It was great view indeed. Thank you, MO.  After checked in, we had our afternoon tea at Lounge at the Park and entertained by a pregnant staff. She is very nice and helpful.   However, I requested to change to other table that can be occupied by myself, my mom and my 5-year old"
"Hi MO team, firstly thank you for having my family and I over the weekend 27 Mar - 29 Mar 2021. I am not one who would normally provide negative feedback and this is the first time that I felt compelled to. Please see below in chronological order:  1. we checked in very late on 27 Mar and I had sent an email and facebook messenger to your team - no feedback/acknowledgement  2. upon arrival at 22:30, the porter was helping us with our luggage. When i said i'll carry my own laptop, the porter commented, ""ok up to you"" in a very sarcastic tone, which I totally did not appreciate, but I left it and gave him the benefit of the doubt that he didn't mean it  3. When i did my booking a couple of weeks before check-in, I requested for 2 rooms to be close to one another as my parents may"
"Staycation paradise especially if you book access to the Club Lounge. Superb view in a luxurious setting with delicious food served.   Overall service was great too and their team even arranged a special surprise treat for my family's special occasion! Special shoutout to Yatie in the Front Office for being super professional and welcoming!   Needless to say, hotel location is right beside KLCC so it can't get better than that. If you haven't tried this hotel before for a staycation, it's worth the experience."
"Friendly staffs started with entrance, check in, housekeeping, gym, breakfast lounge and check out. Smooth check in by check out by Ms Raja Sofia. We overwhelmed with her service. Celebrate belated birthday at MO. They gift complimentary moist chocolate cake. Thanks to Mohana, Michelle, Sarah, Nizam and Daniel for this. We went to gym and fully assisted by Mr. Shah. Very friendly to us! Thank you! Last but not least, very enjoy to have a night at MO facing to twin tower view. Nice room by the way! Will stay here in the future staycation. ü•∞"
"Thanks for the hospitality and specifically for the slice of cake üëçüèª The view as per expected and we are enjoy day and night view. Will be here again with family. TQ to Mohana, Michelle, Sarah, Nizam, Daniel üëçüèª"
We've had an amazing staycation experienced with Mandarin Oriental. They have a very excellent services among the hotels in the KLCC area. Good foods with a complimentary cake has been served too! Can't wait to be back again with this awesome promotion.
"The Afternoon Tea Experience is really worthwhile. Special thanks to Mr Amin, Mr Darwin and Mr Norhan for their friendly service given to us. They explained to my husband the benefits and privilege to become the Elite member."
Good service and fantastic experience at Mandarin Oriental Hotel - Lounge at the Park at KLCC.  The hi tea is quality and delicious. Will. Definitely come again with family and friends.   Highly recommended
"My first visit was in February 2021 and i immediately fell in love with this hotel!! Due to the extra ordinary experience, I have booked another staycation in March 2021 for my birthday and it had just gotten even better!! Everything was perfectly splendid!  The staffs, the room, the facilities, and the services were something that any other hotel could not deliver. MO KL is officially the best 5 start hotel i have been so far. Thank you so much and shall repeat my stay soon!"
"where should i start. all was too good :-) front desk staff named William is an asset! checking in was very well done. he is very accommodative. we had an issue with room type, but William and Rahim sort it out immediately! the bellboy name Hisham helpful.. breakfast at mosaic attended by Firdaus, chit chat kept us company. the service was all sorted out, anticipated... well its Mandarin Oriental!"
"We just married a week before and decided to checked in on 20th February (my wife's birthday). Contact Mohana from Guest Relation department regarding my request to deco the room. unfortunately hotel did not provide deco service during MCO but allow us to book from outside deco team and MO team will assist accordingly on room access.  Thanks to Mohana,Desmond and MO team for the birthday cake. My wife love  Friendly staff and superb service!!! Delicious breakfast. We enjoyed our stay at your hotel. Thank you once again!!!!"
"Very Good location, close to Petronas Towers,  Staff are all very friendly and warm. All the food is very good quality and reasonably priced, Fast check in & check Out. Good breakfast with a decent choice"
"We checked in on 9th February to celebrate my husband's Birthday. As it was MCO, my husband thought we are just checking in to rest and relax away from our busy work schedules.   Prior to check in, I made a request that the hotel assist me with a pool side ""surprise"" birthday dinner arrangement. However due to MCO, they could not agree to my request and suggested in room dinner instead. It was disheartening as in room would be boring i thought. But I agreed to make the best of the situation and said yes to the room dinner arrangements.   As we were checking in on his birthday, I made all prior arrangements for the cake and gifts to be delivered to the hotel directly and all deliveries were well coordinated and managed by hotel staff plus they were discreet about the surprise. I"
"Stay MO for one night to celebrate anniversary. Especially thanks  for Michelle ,mohana,  and Sarah for the simple and sweet decoration. Feel warm.  All staffs are very friendly. Fast check in. Good breakfast ."
"Was impressed with the hospitality of all hotel staff. That's include Desmond at check in counter, the gentleman who deliver my bag and the guy at swimming pool. They all very nice and even can remember your name. Also thanks for birthday surprise for my daughter.   Will surely stay herr again."
This is my repeating trips to MO. Altot it has been established for some years but property overall well maintained. Just hope your team will be able to improve room cleanliness especially dust on rack and stains bedsheets otherwise toilet hygiene is acceptable. Customer services been very up to standard and helpful. They helped us to extend our check out hour.
"We had a special occasion there and they promised room deco upon arrival. There was none when we arrived, told them and they quickly sent some chocolates over. That was nice. Toiletries came in one set only, probably forgotten to replenish after previous guest checked out. This, they acted quickly too and send another set over."
"Incident of unwelcoming of our presence at your pool really spoilt our staycation. After long argument with manager in charge about the blunt and ironic procedure, we giving up on their response and left the amenity. Repeating asked about our room number make my companion feels uncomfortable and not welcoming response. Feel we are trespasser. Their hospitality treatment and the way they're resolve the issue is disappointment. Attitude on our complaint post the incident was bad too. Even during check out, this issue seem was cover up and doesn't address by reception. No proper manner apologizing received. Avoid using their escalator lobby at carpark basement because is dingy. Feel enter the redundant property. The ground lobby layout arrangement a bit puzzled for guest and not"
"Our first time at the Mandarin Oriental KL. And surely not our last. Beyond the unrivalled Christmas lunch spread, elegant marble finishings & awesome bathtub; we were most blown away by the wonderful & warm staff.   Special mentions to Valai at Mosaic, Tajul at the pool, Hafiz at the Mandarin Grill as well as Zarrul & our friend from Sungai Besar at the bar (sorry if we mis-spelled your names).   Spending Christmas at this fine & proudly Malaysian-owned establishment was one of the best decisions we made in 2020."
"I choose this hotel because of the location and Twin Towers view. I was at MO for 02 nights from 22-24 DEC and stayed at room 2318.  I was not greeted upon entry into the hotel entrance. No one is asking to assist with my luggage until I have finished checked in, one of the bell man offered to bring my luggage to the room.   Mattress was average  and the room lacks some usual amenities one would expect from a luxury hotel. Service however was spot on and the staffs acted swiftly upon request. I ordered a piece of cheese cake but this is the worst cheese cake I have ever had !!!   Breakfast was okay but on my 2nd day, the dim sum was served without the sweet soy sauce but only serve with hot sauce ?  Too bad...  My children enjoyed the pool. Pool was okay but smaller than Grand"
Indeed this is the best hotel that I ever stay.Everthing about this hotel is super awesome.Good hotel enviroment with comfortable rooms.You should promote one of your staff Sarah Ahmad Mohana.She was very helpful and always smilling.The best staff ever!
"Mandarin Oriental is a chain that I‚Äôve always enjoyed. You know that when you check in to an MO hotel, it‚Äôs going to be a luxurious experience. MO Paris being one of my favourite hotels in the world.  This was unfortunately not the case at MO Kuala Lumpur.  Our first impression was of the super dark and dingy car park, which was a little scary. I would not feel safe parking downstairs if I was by myself.  Getting to reception was easy enough, the lady who did our check in confirmed our dinner reservations for the next day, we got our keys and were on our way. We dropped off our things in the room and went off to KLCC for lunch and a stroll.  Unbeknownst to us, our cards were demagnetised first whatever reason so we were stranded outside our door with all our shopping bags, and"
"Staycation for 2 nights for my sister‚Äôs birthday. Initial impression not too good upon checking in as the check in queue was 15 people long and I was person 5 in the queue having to wait for half hour before my turn arrived. There were 2 lines and the right line was way faster than the left line. Apart from this, everything else was superb. The lady who helped me check in was exceptionally friendly. Her name was Jeannette. She was apologetic too for the long wait. She gave me a late check out time which I was pleased with it. The rooms were immaculate. I enjoyed spending my time in the room. Very cozy. Very neat. Every request of mine was addressed by my name and the service was superb. Jeannette and Mohana even surprised my sister with a song and cake at our room door. The pool"
Thank you MO Kuala Lumpur. I have great experience. They gave me a sweet treat for my anniversary as a complimentary. Nice stay and everything is excellent. All staffs are very friendly. They always make sure we are in a good care.
"Staycation for 1 night at MO was an awesome experienced,plus excellent services & hospitalities from the staff, ms roziati, ms sarah, ms michelle, ms janette, mr mohana & mr desmond and also for the door person which i didnt know his name üòÖ. We will come again and enjoy our stay here."
"Stayed in the Mandarin Oriental for a night for business - with access to club lounge.   Room was big, nice and clean - a bit dated but comfortable. Aircon was a bit warm in the middle of the night but otherwise, all else was good.   Bathroom was very clean with separate bathtub and shower stall.   Personnel at the club lounge were polite and nice but service was slow - I reckon due to limited manpower - and selection of food were limited too. Ala carte food were available but only limited to one item in the menu per person with no repeats allowed. :( Fortunately, drinks were free flow.  Breakfast spread was severely limited as well.   Overall a good night's stay and due to low occupancy, they allowed me to check out late. Staff were all polite but I have the feeling they are"
"Top notch service by all staff led by Belinda Leong with the arrangement of our 13th Anniversary. Without this, all others won‚Äôt take place.  Zatun was absolutely amazing making us felt ‚Äúhome‚Äù. Never a doubt she‚Äôs a gem at the club lounge.  Not forgetting Razman the ever lively staff. And Zakir so pleasant! Shahrul as well as so attentive to our needs. By far the best stay of all other hotels that we stayed before! Maddy, Nora, Kiran, Saufi, Iera, Suzy  All these staff...  Just wow us during our stay!  Keep it up MO!  We‚Äôll be back soon!"
"Since CMCO has been loosen, I'm glad to be able to stay at MO again. Over the weekend was crowded as MOKUL was providing good deals. Guess thats good for the company & economy. Cost cutting is obvious, lets hope things would go back to the way it was."
Will definitely come back again with the kind of services that i've been provided for. Staff was super helpful. Responsiveness to the request on issue encounter upon checking in. Food was awesome with great hospitality
"by far one of the best service in a hotel I have ever experienced and every staffs at the club lounge were attentive, courteous and friendly to ensure our staycation is well taken care of.  special shout out to Belinda, Zatun, Sharul and everyone at the club lounge for a wonderful experience over the weekend. Food were excellent too at the club lounge. we wished the stay was longer and we will definitely be back soon.   Once again thank you Belinda for the last minute arrangement and Zatun & team at the club lounge."
"Love the hotel, not because it's just next to KLCC, but the staff were exceptionally the best. From the reservation staff, Guest Relation, Receptionist to the F&B. It was my 3rd Wedding Anniversary and early birthday celebration, we were presented with a complimentary devilish yummy choc cake."
"I believe the review here speaks for itself. If anyone is looking for short stay, a quick getaway or just to unwind, look no further. My experience here has been exceptional from before arriving all the way to check out. Attention to details is clear in this hotel with impeccable service. Like to mention a few names who have been assisting me in making my 10th Anniversary a memorable one indeed; Isaura for bookings, always answering my queries without fail, William at the front desk for a great welcome, Mohana and Michelle for bringing the surprise complimentary cake for our anniversary and many more who I can't recall their names. Thank you!!!"
"Well maintained rooms with extremely comfortable beds. Good service as well, given the very large crowd. The check in process required a queue, but it cleared really fast. They really anticipated the crowd and had a plan for it.   However, breakfast was below expectations and limited variety. Not worth the value if it doesn‚Äôt come with the room.  I give 5 stars for service."
The hotel staff and room were all great! We had the best view of KLCC. The hotel staff surprised us with a complimentary anniversary cake and it was yummy. Location is the best! I wish I could stay longer.
"Having a good stay here in mid december. Took quite some time waiting for check in as they are many ppl so the line was very long. But once we were in the room, the room is beautiful. We mentioned we are on our anniversary so they gave us complimentary cake! Good customer service and guest relations experience (morana, iera &michelle). Overall wonderful and will def come again."
"The staff is extremely attentive and helpful. The hotel room is also very comfortable, clean and tiny details of the room amenities show how attentive the design is. It is also near klcc which makes it very convenient. The breakfast buffet can be improved though."
"MO was a favourite staycation destination on mine since many years ago and I always look forward to their hospitality and warmth. However, a recent trip had changed this for me. The treatment we received from the staff were inconsistent, the bell service and doorman were amazingly friendly and efficient. Nonetheless, those at the front desk and club lounge were mostly unfriendly. Food service was particularly slow and very limited, not worth the extra we paid for club services.  If booking with a steep discount or taking a package that allows for free upgrade to club rooms and lounge access then I guess it‚Äôs worth it. However, if you are like me, booking as an MO fan and are opting to pay extra for premium service (I paid for the club rooms and didn‚Äôt rely on a free upgrade as"
"I don't understand why this hotel allow outsiders to come and use a fly project fitness who is doing a pop up !  You have all these people sweating around the public areas, hygiene level at lowest, not sure how they do monitor this outsiders inside the hotel.  As a guest to have ousider using the guest facilities is concerning. Not the best idea during this covid time !"
"Due to the CMCO, we decided to had a 2-night stay at the MO KL for our 4th anniversary celebration. Everything was perfect food was tasty although they had limited breakfast buffet menu. Special thanks to the Guest Recognition manager- Roziati Ismail aka Yati who made our stay extra special. Her customer service is top notch trust me you would be so lucky if you booked your stay through her. She would go extra miles to ensure we enjoy our stay. We would definitely come back! :)"
Booked a room for my daughter‚Äôs birthday. Got complimentary cake which was divine. Thanks to Michele & Mohana for the cake treat. The room was clean and spacious. Breakfast was great. Overall stay was great with friendly staff around to assist us. Tq for good hospitality to Shafiqq at Aqua Restaurant near the swimming pool. Will come again!
"Thanks to all the friendly staffs esp Yatie from the front desk incl Mohana and Sarah for making our anniversary memorable. Room was decorated very nicely and we love the cake!  Will definitely come here again for our next staycation. The room was nice, all staffs were very friendly, love the breakfast buffet, they follow strictly on the SOP and the best part is the hotel is just a walking distance to KLCC."
"Wow! Everything was exquisite! It was a lucky day for me as I got an early check-in, my room 2331 was already ready. I didn't go out from the room at all as I was kind of exhausted, had a very long nap on the amazingly comfortable king bed! I had a Deluxe City View Room King. I personally adored the bathroom the most.  I was lazy to go out and decided to order an in-room dining service - Curry Laksa! It was absolutely scrumptious though it was fairly spicy, loved it. The breakfast was a buffet setting with great selections - Continental, Chinese, Malaysian, Indian and Healthy. I also loved the Mosaic restaurant interior design and layout, simply elegant.  The overall customer service was excellent. Had an express check-out and it went smooth. On the other hand, I was a little"
Excellent service from the hotel staff and a perfect room for the weekend. Special thanks to Michelle & Sara for bringing the birthday cake to the room. It was a pleasant surprise and the cake was very delicious. Absolute value for money. Will visit again soon.
"Thanks to Jeanette for apologising upon check in due to long que. Also to Sara & Michelle for bringing the cakes to our room. There is one senior Indian guy (prolly from concierge) offering an express check out to us showing that they are giving fully attention to their guest who is waiting which we really appreciate it. We proceed with him & coming back to Sara for some questions which she really helped us on our queries without any complaints! A great customer service experience. Maybe just need a little bit of improvement for breakfast experience. Not much of foods varieties & preferable self service for better experience. Overall, the customer service exp was great!!!"
"Totally awesome. Its all started as i came back to Malaysia and just finished my 2 weeks Mandatory Quarantine at my choices hotel. But before going home, i just tought of chilling at MO with my wife for a night  I wasn't wrong, with just one nite stay, it was enough to make me forget  about those 2 weeks of quarantined i had.  Good job and please maintain the excelent standard."
Very cooperative staff from all department. Good food from the restaurant and fridge alao full of snacks and drinks. Next to KLCC and accessible by public transport. Near to Pavilion and Avenue K Mall.
The Mandarin Oriental Hotel has excellent service. The staff is good and  very attentive. Room has excellence view of KLCC with Comfortable bed and a good night sleep. Cleanliness and sanitisation is high .  Highly recommends to friends and family to stay here. Good shopping location and area. Many varieties of cafe and floors to choose from. Walking distance to tourist area and a beautiful park close by.
"Big thanks to their guest recognition team, Michelle, Yatie & Tracy for making my stay magical by decorating the room for my birthday! Room is clean and comfortable along with a nice park view. Splendid."
"To rest in town, this hotel is perfect. Near all the facilities. Too close to klccüòÅüëçüèªüëçüèª Large and beautiful swimming pool. City view from our room(executive room) and spacious bathroom. This room is also spacious. Suitable for families with children"
"What a great stay we had over the weekend. It was a great gesture from MO to decorate our room as its our anniversary. We missed the breakfast but we could opt for the in-room service with a good selection of pastries, fruits, yogurt and hot drinks/juices.  The view from the room was great at night. Was hoping that KLCC would be lighted fully but it was still great."
We stayed for one day just to celebrate our anniversary. Staffs are very helpful. Especially Desmond & Sarah. They even provide complimentary cakes for our anniversary. Totally enjoyed our stay. Accessible to klcc. It‚Äôs just 2mins walking distance.
Excellent hospitality from the hotel staffs from welcoming to dine-in room services Very friendly and prompt.  Room is very clean and well organised with all the amenities needed for a short staycation.
"Due to the MCO we were unable to take the holiday that we had planned for October Half Term. As a consolation, we decided to indulge in a night of luxury at The MO Hotel in KLCC.  What a great consolation it was! A modern hotel without the generic trappings of a hotel that could be anywhere in the world.  A recently refurbished and updated jewel in the KLCC Crown, blending the best of what's new and up to date with a traditional colonial, and oriental style.  This was evident in the hotel's communal areas the hotel rooms. Most lavish was the delightfully appointed bathroom, reminiscent of The Great Gatsby  era of grandeur. The view of The Twin Towers and the sumptuous bedding made for a fantastically lazy staycation where one could just enjoy the views from the comfort of your"
"One would think you cannot be surprised anymore in life, but this hotel exceded my expectations. Location is very good as it is close to Suria and Pavillion for shopping and great restaurants. Rooms are lavish and amazingly good for the price I paid my staycation. Restaurant offering is exciting with a big buffet, great afternoon tea overlooking the park and a fantastic chinese restaurant. But above all, I was amazed by the service provided by their team and the attention to detail. From the arrival experience with doormen, reception to the pool, lai po Heen and mosaic team. Always a smile, always willing to please me and my friends by consistently being a step ahead of us. Now I know what stands for 5 stars service. It has been my first time at a Mandarin Oriental hotel and"
"The event was held at the Aqua Restaurant as our company turned 100 years old so a celebration was indeed necessary.  Despite the great service rendered, I was highly disappointed by the treatment provided by the chef or waiter or captain or whoever .....   For dinner I ordered the the Tenderloin from the Grill, medium rare, thinking I was going to have a wonderful dinner.  When the dish came, I could not even cut the meat, leave alone chew the meat. I complained but was simply told that that's the way it is. My entire dish was taken away but nothing was replaced!!!  I was not only shocked but sadden that a luxury hotel of such does not even care about it's customer or at least get the chef to explain or at least replace my food!!!  ... so my colleagues  shared their dinner with"
Thank u for the sweet and warm welcome from Mimie at the reception. And thank u Jeanette and Desmond for the birthday decorations in the room.  Really appreciate it.  The hotel is lovely and up to my expectations.  Satisfied with my overnight stay.  My husband love this staycation at mandarin oriental KL.
Will come back again as I had late check-in at 10 pm due to personal reasons. Very near to KLCC and Pavilion which provides avenue for guests to do shopping. Other than that guests can also enjoy other facilities and benefits that MO offers.
"Having frequent the mandarin grill (before mco) and la casa  cigar bar in MO & kyo, we have been avid supporter of MO kl prior to the mco. We stayed n MO properties throughout Beijing, Guangzhou and various others, we were koched out by doorman Jeff and manager Wan Fauziah for using the toilet because we were not hotel guests. Our cars were parked with the jockey and had drinks at the bar. This level of service is ridiculous for a5 star hotel in kl. Hope you go bankrupt during mco."
"One night staycation for my birthday and it was marvellous. Bed was comfy, room was nice and clean. Check-in and out was swift and efficient. Room has a nice view of the KLCC park which provides nice ambience and colour to the back drop settings of KL skyline especially dusk and dawn views. The complimentary birthday cake was very thoughtful from the hotel (I purposely reminded them during check-in). However, MO needs to check the crowd control during breakfast time. The queue was long and limited servings during these turbulence MCO times. It was overall nice experience and I should be back!"
Had a staycation with husband and the hotel staff managed to surprise him with a birthday cake! Small gestures go a long way. Goes to show how Mandarin Oriental takes care of their customer needs. Special out out to Desmond at Reception and all the other hard working staff! Keep up the good work.
This time i had wonderful stay compare to my first visit in July. A big thanks to Afiq and the Kedahan Guy from Aqua and also Ms Cindy from Mosaic. Because of them our stay are so meaningful. Please keep the momentum to serve the guests.  As Fans of MO i don't think so this program really gave me privilege's or extra benefits  compare to whom are not joined the program.
"From the minute you step in.. you could feel the warmth of the staff members greeting you. Security to reception and just anybody along the  way.  At every juncture, you get called by name and being remembered after a 1 hour breakfast feels like flying business class. A true 5 star hotel and example of Malaysian Hospitality at its best.  Despite all that has come the way of the hospitality business in 2020, the MOKL #staystrong"
"Me and my boyfriend had a 13th Anniversary celebration at Mandarin Oriental Kuala Lumpur. We picked Twin Tower View King Room to stay. The staffs are friendly! The environment are great and the comfort and cozy feeling unable to describe by words! I enjoy the TV in the bath tub, viewing Twin Tower while lay on the bed, and the fitness room was really good too! Overall is excellent for my celebration at here."
"We booked Club Twin Tower rooms, this was supposed to give us access to the club lounge. Upon check in where we informed that the club lounge was closed. We only found out when I ask about the lounge access details.   Having beverages at any other time was no longer available / perhaps withdraw without inform now (which would be one of the usual benefits for club rooms).  The meals at breakfast, tea and cocktail hour remained the same throughout our stay. We were also made to feel like 2nd class citizens when the hotel seemed to prefer to cater for foreigner (we're not allow to have a seat with nice view even it's empty but been told it's reserved???? Dunno for WHO, obviously, util the end hours e.g. 10+ am breakfast /  5.30 pm cocktail the nice view seat still remained empty -"
"We booked 2 Club Park View King rooms for 2 nights. This was supposed to give us access to the club lounge. At no time (either during the booking process on the hotel official website or thereafter during communications with the hotel) where we informed that the club lounge was closed. We only found out when I made a call to ask about the dress code for the lounge. Whilst I understand that during RMCO, the lounge may be closed due to numbers etc, this should have been made transparent before one makes a booking.  So instead of the lounge, we were told that breakfast, tea and cocktails could be enjoyed at Mosaic and lounge on the park. No mention about having beverages at any other time (which would be one of the usual benefits for club  rooms).   The meals at breakfast, tea and"
"Excellent hospitality by the hotel personnel even during the pandemic, weekdays is the good choice to stay as the weekend will be crowded with the guest. Comfy room and location are accessible to KLCC by walking."
We had a lovely stay at MO for our daughter‚Äôs 2nd birthday. Great service and they even gave a delicious cake and a bouquet of flowers for her. Check in was a breeze and receive complimentary welcome drink as well. They even tidied up our room when we went out for dinner. The staff at the pool area was also so courteous. The only set back was that the breakfast buffet selection was not much. But we will definitely come back as the service is top notch and just next to KLCC.
Booked a room for a staycation with my bestfriend. We love KLCC so this is the best hotel for us with it being very accessible to KLCC. Very comfortable room. Brought my 1yo with me and she is very happy to be in the room too. We worked on the workstation while we chat the night away. Definitely one of the best staycations we've had since a very long time and looking forward to make Mandarin Oriental our annual staycation! :)
"Was one of the best hotels in kl ( everything was excellent) The staff was really genuine humble and professional, The food was excellent ! The treatment that the staff in the mosaic restaurant was superb! You guys deserved an award!"
"Good and strategic location, nice environment and its a good choice if you want to go shopping and sky bar in just a walking distance. Room also spacious and comfortable for stay. Its also having nice restaurant inside the hotel. in overall, its really a good choice."
"I stayed at MO for 3 days 2 night at Executive Park View Room. I was celebrating my husband's birthday. So prior to my stay, I emailed MO Team back and fourth asking question and request stuff. They listen to my request and answer my question professionally. When I arrived at the reception desk, I was greeted warmly by Miss Jeanette. She explained clearly about stuff that I need to know.   I really enjoy my stay and will come again near future. The biggest factor is the staff. And food of course.   I stayed in many luxury hotel in and out of Malaysia. By far, MO Team are the best !  Wait, did I tell you that you can walk to KLCC less than 30 second from MO. Yes! I really enjoy my stay and you should experience it too.  Thanks MO KL Team. I really appreciate your hard work."
"Not being able to travel outside had us curious on doing local staycations instead and going to Mandarin Oriental for the Merdeka weekend was a fabulous choice. The hotel was very busy as expected but the staff are all attentive, friendly and always trying their best to accommodate us. Expect lines during check-in and check-out Hours during peak weekends like this so I highly suggest going for express check-out option.   We had the BBQ dinner at the poolside one night and the whole family enjoyed it so much. Kids swam and ate while we chilled over some wines and cocktails! Having the beautiful KLCC park and skyline as the pool background is just priceless!  Mandarin Oriental KL still proves to be the legend that it is in the city! Can‚Äôt wait to come back for our next staycation."
"Everything is perfect. From check in till check out! Will definitely be my top favorite hotel in KL! This is my 3rd time in MO! This time because of my post accident, and MO definitely a place to relax, recovery and healing!"
"Spent Merdeka weekend with my family as a staycation and could not have chosen a better place to stay. I have hear a lot about the Mandarin group reputation but my stay can confirm the high standards this company has.   Since the arrival, they welcomed us with a great smile and helped us with our luggage. It was the first time for my children in a luxury hotel and they were very surprised with every little detail the staff was having with all of us. Room were spacious, even with the extra bed in one of them. Fine quality finishes, luxury bathroom, all very clean, and great views to the park and the pool. My children could not resist and ran to the pool immediately were they stayed until they closed it at 9. Everyone very attentive, served complimentary water and provided fresh"
"Stayed for 3 days and 2 nights with my family.  The services was impeccable, the hotel staff were very professional and kind - looking good in their beautiful uniform! Spot on right next to the KLCC with superb swimming pool overlooking Kuala Lumpur skyline. The breakfast was excellent. Variety spread for buffet dinner too - fresh oysters, and sashimi!  Indeed deserved the Stars!"
"I mean what I said. It has been a while since we last stayed at MOKL. The Staycation was due to the unscheduled water cut that hit Klang Valley. I know my wife was all stressed up, so I decided to book a 2 night stay from 5 - 7 Sept 2020. We were thankful that the hotel put us up in room 2902 and the view was splendid! Without having to elaborate, I just simply can say the stay was awesome with everyone that was involved with my stay was top notch. Only tiny disappointment was first day lunch at Lai  Po Heen. When you miss / forgotten to deliver an order/item for the Dim Sum lunch, you disturb the dining flow which otherwise I could have rated it 10/10. Looking forward for a return trip."
"It was such a heart warming high tea afternoon  As I was warmly welcomed by Kamal And beautiful services ushered by Norhan, Maddy and Zam. They were so friendly and lovely. It felt like home :)  As I only Rsvp for 2pax, though I couldn‚Äôt get a sofa because it was only the 2 of us. We were assured to a center view spacious enough to our comfort. Thank you Lounge by the park for your good service and the tea collection on strawberries afternoon tea. It has much improved ! Very satisfied as compared to my last visit.  Will definitely come back. Thank you again. It made my Tuesday a relax and soothing one indeed.   Top point Amazing service  Quiet/peaceful for chatters Worth every dime of your time Just right for tea   Thank you MO Well done !"
The AC was found in ERROR mode which causing intermittent stoppage. The temperature was not able to be adjusted same goes with the AC Fan speed. The AC Controller Display was hanged due to the ERROR.  Call was made to the front desk but no one was available and the line goes to operator.

During check out the front desk staff promised to respond with the justification reply with regard to the defective AC and yet still zero respond until today. Other services and hospitality observed to be good.
"Good for vacation as it is near to KLCC and KLLC park for shopping and exercise. Good location. The rate of the hotel is value for money for their service, buffet and rooms. Safety precautions on covid 19 matters is good"
One of the best experienced staying in this hotel . Both Jeannette & Mohana was very kind and helpful to made an arrangement for my wife surprise birthday celebration . Highly recommended for family stay .
"Being next to Suria KLCC is it‚Äôs main plus point. You can easily walk over to KLCC for shopping and the KLCC park for a nice morning jog. The room is spacious, comfortable and well stocked with amenities. Service was great and the staff were all very polite and hospitable. We didn‚Äôt quite enjoy our in room dining though. It was mediocre and my chicken was hard unfortunately. Expected more considering it was priced higher that a similar meal at a good restaurant. Other then that - had a lovely stay."
"This is our 2nd time here, my family (husband and 14M old baby) checked in right before the long weekend for my husband's birthday. We booked the Mandarin room this time around and it was perfect for my baby to walk around because it was so spacious, overlooking the KLCC park. The moment we stepped in my baby went to every corner and shouted 'oh wow' repeatedly. We were surprised with a birthday cake on the first night after we got back from our dinner and a box of praline chocolate the morning before we checked out. There was some minor issues with the room, which i communicated to their front desk, they were quick to address my complaint despite the full occupancy that weekend. The staff at the pool, house keeping, front desk, even to the concierge was very friendly and"
"Our first time at the ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù MO branded hotel. Of course we were excited but even more looking forward to cut short this stay.  In a world where travel industry businesses are gravely effected by the health pandemic one would assume that hotels, any hotels would do whatever they can to survive or even get bookings.  We are appalled by the lack of professionalism and coordination that the hotel appear to be offering to their guests.   The wait to the check in counter was easily 60 minutes plus long and to wait for the room keys was tediously lengthy too.  To make things worse, there‚Äôs NO SOCIAL DISTANCING at all!!! Kids running around the lobby, people not wearing face masks, entry & exit point not adhered to. Hugely disappointing experience even before getting to the"
Took us hours to check in. Front desk are slow and not helping. Hotel doesn‚Äôt have online check in and making the check in process ridiculously slow.   Definitely not worth staying in this hotel. Pool is small and crowded. At 5pm and people are still queuing for check in
"Love everything about the hotel. Excellent hospitality. Upon arrival, we were warmly welcomed by the staff. The staff was extremely friendly, Parking is adequate. Hotel was very clean as well as the room. Spacious room, Just a few steps to KLCC."
"For the last four years I come back to stay in Mandarin Oriental KL for my Wedding Anniversary, the hotel arranged a good services and some deco for the room... This year they forgot the cakes and drink for us...but overall their services are good and staff are good."
M.O has definitely made my stay worth while. Excellent customer service and attentive staff. The swimming pool is very well kept. Room was cozy and the breakfast was delicious. The room dine in service was also great. Wifi connection was also fast; no intermittent. The tv channels reception was good; close to HD. Keep up the good work!
We were truly amazed by the friendliness of hotel staff and furnishing quality of the hotel and room. We enjoyed the swimming pool and was surprised by helpful staff and always smiling. We had an unforgettable experience of what is truly 5-star quality!.
"Achieving a full satisfaction from a guest was not so hard. Good employer resulted in the good employee.  Our trip was for a night to check out what is the different between hotel at the KLCC vicinity. We have tried more than 4 hotel chains at the area.  MO carry a string brand the location near KLCC. It is a stone throw away from KLCC. When we stayed at the Grand Hyatt, the view from our room was the KLCC and MO hotel. The hotel looks great from far away; tennis court and lively pool.  That makes us deciding to try it for a night. I did not book the Club room and Suite because of the house rules restrict access to the guest below 12 years old and restriction of the Denim. We end up booking Executive with Park View room.  Pro: Room deco was nice, fully carpet with IPTV, cheerful"
"Located in the best part of the city and pretty close to the Petronas twin towers and shopping centers. But, the main reasons that I gave five stars are because of their friendly staff, chic structure and great service. By the way, thanks for our anniversary surprise! You guys were awesomeüëåüèº"
