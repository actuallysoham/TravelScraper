"We have a pleasant buffet dining experience at Curate last week for dinner. My kids love the food and desserts there. Furthermore, their service is excellent and Iqah is indeed friendly to serve us too.  For sure we will visit to have lunch or dinner buffet  soon again."
"The stay at Four Seasons Kuala Lumpur is most memorable. The hotel is a five star hotel yet the staff was very very friendly. The rooms are very luxurious especially the bed. I will go to Four Seasons to sleep in its luxurious bed.  The bathroom is also excuisite. I felt like I had my own spa in the bedroom.  I did not get the chance to try all the restaurants at the hotel but the breakfast at Curate was a truly nice surprise. The food range is wide for your choice and I truly enjoyed its puri, pancake, congee and dimsum. What your pallette fesires, it is available at Curate breakfast, which is mind you, inclusive in the room rate. 2 coupons for each room.  If there is a hotel you want to go to in Kuala Lumpur, there is no other hotel that you should choose but Four Seasons"
"Stayed for 3 nights for our honeymoon. The decorations made were beautiful. Room was very comfortable. Housekeepers were very professional. Do check out their offers, as it is really worth it and satisfying.  Overall experience : 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻"
"We stayed for 1 night. Loved the amenities and fancy room. Good location for a family stay as it is near to KLCC park and Suria KLCC - shopping, Aquaria, Twin Towers visit. Hotel staff were helpful and friendly. Room and toilets were clean. The breakfast food at Curate was good. Definitely worth to visit again."
"Always a great experience with Four Seasons KL. It's good to be back again, especially when they're always very welcoming and showers you with complimentary stuffs upon arrival. Loved the pool and also the grill options. Can't wait to be back again <3"
stayed 1 night and it was fancy mancy and cozy. the facilities was da bomb. love the sauna room. The staff (Zariff and Audrey) and others were so friendly and welcoming.   Overall the room was satisfied and I felt like Kim Kardashian for a night. hahah.  5 STAR!
Made a last minute booking and arrived early. Thanks to Zariff for smooth check in and assisting us to get in the room early although check in time is at 3pm. Got a great corner room also! Thanks Zariff for the hospitality!
"Hotel staff, Bryan & Zarifff are very helpful, welcoming and friendly. The room is clean, comfortable and spacious with the design. The breakfast is tasty with variety of food available. Overall nice stay and definitely will repeat."
Came in slightly early and receive a great welcome by the team lead by Mr Zariff. A great hotel with a great view. A walking distance from KLCC. My kid really enjoying her stay. Definitely will come again.
"Our family of four stayed at Four Seasons Kuala Lumpur recently and it was absolutely amazing to say the least. Albeit the hotel was full, we did not have to wait long for our early check-in (thank you Gurmit!) or any of our in-room requests. The friendly and cheerful hotel staffs all ensured our stay was pleasant and well catered throughout (shout out to Ellie Low for being extra hospitable).  Additionally, the location is ideal as we had direct access to surrounding malls and parks on foot. And as a bonus touch, we applaud that the hotel is up-to-date in its in-room tech devices and the breakfast spread is lovely! Shout out to Nadia for ensuring our tables were tip top and our coffee was perfect!   We definitely cannot wait to come back! Thank you Four Seasons!"
"came here for relaxing spa and lunch...went home with second hand smoke in my lungs.   They placed me next to heavy smokers next to the pool and gastric pains as they couldnt serve me my salad and soup in 40mins even with 2  hours advance notice and a reservation.   Mind you, i ALREADY paid for a 3 course meal but i settled for soup and salad as they, weirdly in 2021, had no vegetarian options. Is this four seasons or 3 star hotel?  their restaurant manager promised to compensate me for this inconvenience, but not surprisingly i hear nothing.  avoid like plague and dont waste your money. Not like four seasons anywhere else in the world, and i meant that in  bad way."
"Kuala Lumpur is a dynamic and exciting city with a great energy, and the Four Seasons is an excellent base to explore. This stylish property oozes sophistication, and places more emphasis on modernity than tradition - much like KL itself.   The room was plush and comfortable, and provided me with the perfect place to relax after a day of exploring Malaysia’s energetic capital city. Guests have the option to choose either city or park views. I wouldn’t say one is necessarily better than the other; it all comes down to personal preference.  The service at the Four Seasons Kuala Lumpur was absolutely impeccable and I found the staff to be warm, friendly and genuine.   I highly recommend heading to Bar Trigona for amazing cocktails which are made with sustainably sourced"
"A disappointing experience really. Firstly, we couldn't check in until 4.40pm, despite arriving at 1.30pm (check in is 3pm and we were happy to wait until then). Sometimes these issues do occur but the lack of communication was just really bad.  The hotel was completely overcapacity for what they could actually deal with. I understand that Covid restrictions mean greater staff workload but when you're paying this much it's not unreasonable to expect to hotel to get in extra staff (or just not sell every single room!)  It took 15-20 minutes to even get a lift down to dinner because there were too many people waiting for lifts and the stairs were locked. Staff were also encouraging us to break the Covid restrictions and squeeze into already packed lifts.  The food was pretty good,"
Best service and experience one can ever receive. Four season team will assist and cater the event to your every needs. They are also very open minded to feedback and improvement. Thanks Ellie you the best. Will come back again for sure!
"I would like to say Thank You to chef Jimmy☺️ You brought me the original taste from home (Hong Kong) which I miss badly😋 you make my day! I still remember when 1st time met you, you said “anytime you wish to eat any Hong Kong dishes just msg me!” That’s really warm and touching at the moment! For me and also all my HK friends, we miss home! Anyway, the service of Four Seasons is always the best, this is the reason why I keep my membership renewal, not for all but just for the professional and good service🙌🏻"
"Even though it was just a short staycation, I was so impressed with professionalism shown by your hosts especially Mr Gurmit and his team Adam and Nadia. Azwin and her team at the Curate really took initiative to ensure our group of people are  taken of. We enjoyed the overall experience and looking back to come back again soon."
"Had an awesome 3 nights stay here this weekend. Not surprising, we only have good things to say about this hotel from the gorgeous room and bathroom; as well as matching great hospitality from concierge to reception to housekeeping to Curate. Despite the hotel being full house, everyone were still so attentive. The Ipad in the room is highly appreciated and any queries will be answered within seconds. Location is central with KLCC right next door and Avenue K on the opposite road. We ordered few room service and grab, as we’re reluctant to leave the hotel room. Kids enjoyed the bathtub very much. Swimming pool is big but no proper kids pool (the one near the adult pool is super cold so end up everyone use one common pool (SOP in place due to Covid precaution). Love their"
"Came here for a staycation on 2nd April 2021 until 3rd April 2021 and loved everything about this hotel! Special thanks to Mr Faiq from the reservation team that assist me with my booking. Also thank you for all 6B staff that are super helpful especially Ms Carmen who do my check in. She is very friendly. Not to forget, Mr Faiez from the operator are also being helpful with all my request, a very convienience way to request stuff from the iPad. Not to forget the bellman who help us with the Luggage. Over all, a top notch & good experiece, service for my first time visit. Looking forward to stay again with FSKL."
"We requested for an early check by 2 pm , the front desk manager Zariff got us a room on time and even got our room upgraded to a premium room with klcc park view !  During check in , the kids got to play some games and got many goodies too!   The room’s view is soooo nice !!! The room was perfect ! Toilet is amazing ! Enjoyed the free refill nespresso and harney and sons teas too !!   Most of the staffs here are very attentive and helpful ! During breakfast , they even came a few times to the table and even served cappuccinos 😘! Food was nice too!   Due to the school hols, the lift takes slightly longer. Pool is slightly smaller though hehe. We found an area adjacent to the pool where they plant all sorts of herbs which we find it’s quite interesting !   Everything seems so"
Brought my family for a staycation and had the best experience ever! Hotel was great but the hospitality was beyond excellent. Kids and parents in-law had a wonderful experience thanks to the wonderful hospitality by the hotel staff. Shout out to Zariff & Bryan for making our stay a memorable one! Thank you and Thank you!
"Went with family for pre birthday celebration, overall experience is awesome! Thanks to Zariff and Boyan for their top service! Will definitely come again in future!  Room is spacious and we enjoy comfortably."
"Staying at the Four Seasons KL is definitely a MUST, even a staycation! The hotel staff are so wonderful and they provide an excellent service. They have this “can-do” attitude and gave their very best effort to accommodate my need during my stay. The facilities are great, the hotel room definitely has that wow factor as soon as you come in and the room smeels very pleasing. The bed is amazing , it feels like sleeping on clouds. Dinner was served at the curate. The buffet option is a bit limited but the food served was great. Thanks to Jackson for the nice mocktails and great service. The pool quite spacious and due to pandemic they control the amount of people in the pool area. I also used the gym which I am pleased to say is well equipped, clean and spacious. The changing and"
Called the hotel to arrange for a weekend stay for our parents on 12-14th March for their anniversary  . Mr. Faiq and team assisted in making the stay very memorable and comfortable for them. The managers and all the staff went beyond the call of duty and gave them wonderful service by decorating the room and arranging for lovely surprises during their stay . Thank you kindly 4 seasons ...won’t hesitate to recommend you and look forward to a stay soon as travel restrictions allow.  Dato and Datin were very appreciative and thank you once again!
"We came to stay for our wedding anniversary + husband's birthday for the weekend. Telling them the purpose of our stay during booking via email, they prepared cakes & little treats for all our children (3). I ordered deco which costed RM80 and they did it exactly as per the catalogue, nothing more :)  We had the city-view room at 17th floor. Extra bed was given at no extra charges. The amenities are over the top - always love L'occitane products. They have a tablet in room where you can directly chat and/or request for anything with housekeeping or even food or spa. You can even actually just Whatsapp them and they will respond promptly!  I requested for the kids bathrobe & slippers, which was quite and they kids really enjoyed as they get to feel something customized for them"
"Spent 4 nights in the hotel. Love the hotel facilities and the service that was provided to us during the stay. We have faced the problem from times to times the stay but the hotel took immediate action to solved the problem. This is something that four seasons a five stars hotel definitely earn it. We have problem with checking in as staffing was not offering to take our bag and some of the staff seems not to be updated in the information regarding the readiness of the facilities. I would suggest that the hotel staff should communicated in the same language. Moving to the 1st room, we have baht tub and toilet issues which we moved to 2nd room with lighting and speaker issue, 3rd room, we have the television issue and water issue. However, with changing room quite often. Me and"
My family and i stay at Four Seasons on my birthday weekend. The staffs service were excellent and the best! They have a personal touch especially Bryan who arrange a surprise with complimentary ballon & cake and Zharif. We will definately come back!!
Best hospitality. All the staffs were really thoughtful. Even got a surprise room deco. I mentioned i was going to stay for babymoon. Surprised that four seasons made a room deco with all the balloons and cake. Thanks!
"Came here for a staycation while visiting aquaria and we loved everything about this hotel. From the service to room and food, everything was exceptional from the moment we stepped foot into the hotel. Mr Bryan greeted us warmly during check-in he make our check in faster and inform us about the room was ready.  Not to forget En Zariff and En Hakim make our check out smoothly. The room was amazing. It’s very spacious and comfortable and we were fascinated by the smart toilet in the bathroom.  The pool were great, kids had their enjoyment experience and didn’t want to go back. Breakfast buffet was super and they served many types of cuisine for the breakfast buffet.   There is small incident in the room, I accidentally drop a tea cup and try to get the housekeeping through phone"
A nice stay with my family and applause to the scrumptious breakfast except for an unfortunate parking misinformation which is not detailed by the concierge staffs. Please ask them to explain the free parking access in detail because they don’t bother to tell you where to actually park and how you can get reimbursed. I actually spent an extra money for the misinformation. I don’t expect it for the price i pay. Please at least match the service i got from the overall stay.
"Came here for a staycation to celebrate my husband‘s birthday. Loved everything about this hotel. From the service to room and food, everything was exceptional from the moment we stepped foot into the hotel. Ms Audrey greeted us warmly during check-in and sent us off during our check-out.  Special thanks to En Zariff and Mr Bryan for upgrading our room to park-view suite, making our stay more memorable. The room was amazing. It’s very spacious and comfortable. You get a beautiful view of the park and skyline. You can also see a bit of the twin tower on the side. We were most fascinated by the smart toilet in the bathroom.   Breakfast is such a big deal to me and they definitely nailed it from the breakfast spread to the taste. They served many types of cuisine for the breakfast"
"My little family of three were here for a staycation over the weekend and had the most enjoyable time. Our stay was made extra special with the warm hospitality from Mr Gurmit, Mr Zariff and Mr Marc. We are already looking forward to our next stay."
"Check in and check out was smooth. The in-room dining was amazing and delivered on time. The breakfast spread was not too wide but good enough for me. Thank you Zhariff Haqiem for constantly checking on us and for upgrading our room from Junior Suite to Park View suite. Also, special thanks to Kunio for the anniversary decoration arrangement & a nice flower bouquet. Will definitely come again for our next anniversary (or probably just a short weekend staycation). Awesome job, FS team!"
"Yes it’s true the price is on the higher end but but but every penny spent at this amazing hotel is worth it. All the staff are friendly and welcoming, one thing about FSKL the staff don’t judge you base on what you wear.   We had the privilege to stay in the Junior Suite room 1111 and the view of the park is amazing and the room is so spacious.   Furthermore my wife was lucky to get a slot for the spa treatment and from her reaction, she said it’s the best spa ever with all the amazing spa facilities.   And lastly -   Shout out to all these amazing stars at the hotel that made our stay memorable and even made me extended my stay from 1 night to 3 nights stay.   From front office - Saima, Razif and Bryan  From Curate - Iqa, Vivian, Jackson and the bubbly waffle chef (I forgot"
"I booked a room - King room, with city view. It was breathtaking. I got bathub facing the view like I always wanted. The facilities like gym and pool are well maintained. Excellent hotel service especially at front desk. Miss Teeve, the duty manager was very friendly and professional. But the hotel may need to improve reservations line because I had issue with my reservations. But luckily I was assisted by Miss Pq and Mr Zafran. Good customer service. I also wanted to compliment an excellent service from pool bar & grill, Mr Azhar. For breakfast buffet at Curate, there are many option and choices and the food are delicious. Overall, this is my favourite staycation out of all hotel I went to. Worth every penny that I spend!"
"My daughter and myself checked in for a short staycation at the Four Seasons KL and it was by far the best decision we have made. It was our first trip away since Covid-19 and we were apprehensive about safety and we were not disappointed at all.  Service was amazing from the minute we got out of our car. They knew our names (which made my daughter feel very special.). I had also told them that this was my daughter's belated birthday treat, and they really went all out to make my little girl feel so special, which i appreciated.  They decorated our room, they had a birthday cupcake ready for her but more importantly, they really went out way to give us personalized service that made us feel so welcomed and at home. Everyone knew our name and made sure to check that we were okay"
"Stayed here for a night for my birthday and it was the best decision. Room was tasteful and comfortable, with great view of the KLCC park. Excellent service by staff throughout including at breakfast service. Definitely recommended!"
"Undoubtedly the best hotel experience we have had, through and through.  From the moment we booked our stay, the magic started to happen.  The immense attention that this team places on every single facet of your stay creates such a wonderful experience.  Our guest experiences manager was THE BEST so a big thank you to Gurmit.  Check-in experience is flawless, each staff member addresses you by name throughout your stay, the room amenities are top class, service everywhere is unparalleled.  We will definitely be back!"
"I made a promise to the staff, ill write a review regarding my stay at FSKL recently. Let me just say my expectation was already high when i booked for a celebratory stay for my 6th Anniversary and still FSKL hit it out of the ballpark!  Let me just start that the parking navigation need some work but thats beyond their control, for now haha.   Everything was magnificent. From the lobby experience, calling us by our names (no i haven't even introduce myself) to the reception (upgraded our rooms and friendly staff) it already sets the scene that it is going to be such a personalized stay.   Rooms were impeccable, the decoration was immaculate. Everything was how its was to be and more. The view overlooking the KLCC park was breathtaking. Not the first time we stay in a hotel"
"We spent wonderful time staying in FS kl.I would like to specially mention to you  Kunio,Sukyee,Spa team and Jennie that I received impeccable service from the hotel staff.All staff members are efficient at their work and I really appreciate every one of them to cooperate with me a lot for celebrating my friend's birthday.Definitely,FS kl is one of best hotels in Malaysia and strongly recommend to stay here!!!"
"I stayed FS hotel KL during my birthday. My friend booked room and spa. We had a great time with FS great hospitality especially Kunio san Sukyee san.  Spa massage was awesome, I highly recommend if you haven’t try it.Also you should go Bar Trigona.  It was a beat birthday ever!I definitely come back and recommend to my friends to stay FS hotel KL."
"I bought Four Seasons Lifestyle Card from Miss Jennifer Ong and I must thank her for her great recommendations and her close follow up through and through. The hospitality that was extended to us by the staff at FS was awesome, filled with so much love and passion in what they do... from the concierge to the reception, the attending staff at dinner and breakfast buffets as well as at the lounge/ bar...  we were enveloped at all times with such tender loving care. It really says a lot when my  teenage daughter who always prefer to stay home is looking forward to our next stay over! The facilities provided in the room were top notch. Nespresso coffee machine, toiletries from Loccitane and we didn't have to go to Japan to experience the super smart WC. There is sensor that opens"
"I don't usually write reviews, but this prompted me to do so.  I have always have the best hospitality experience with Four Seasons hotel with Malaysia (and Singapore, Dubai). We've had a short staycation after the lockdown in Four Seasons Hotel KL, and were treated like kings and queens.  The service is undeniably the best in class, from the concierge, the frontdesk, the in-room service, housekeeping, cleanliness, it was all top notch. Special thanks for Mr. Amirul from the frontdesk that ensured the check-in process was a breeze.  We've had some hiccups with the rooms, and the maintenance went straight to action and fixed it immediately. They even personally followed up, and remembered our names to ensure everything went smoothly.  On top of that, I had also arranged for the"
"Dear all, this review is a long writing as it is my honest review deep down from my heart 🥰  First of all, FS Kuala Lumpur is worth to stay after a very long weekdays and hustle in our work. Trust me.   Thanks a lot to Amirul from Front Desk for the big surprise. FS staff welcome my husband and I with open arms. They are well mannered and treated us like a king and queen of the day. Thanks to Mr Rozman and Thamim at groundfloor, Mr Zariff, Bryan and Ms Farah, Audrey, Carmen and Sukyee.  Once arrived at room, I am thrilled for the room selection. The room decoration, the selection of furniture and wall colour, even the scent is very exclusive. The quality of mattress and pillow is the best quality ever. A warm thanks too Mr Kunio for the swan decoration 🥰  On the second day,"
The environment and service here is definitely 5 star grade! The foods here are also 5 star level. The staffs here are really helpful and friendly. Will definitely Recommend my friends and family come over and have a stay
"One thing that really impressed me was the warm hospitality and consistent energy by their staff toward customers. Fast response and provide helping hands whenever required. Facilities & location are good, staff are great, and maybe food selection in Curate Restaurant need some upgrade & addition"
"We were staying at the Premier Park-View Room which was facing the KLCC Park where we can watch colourful water fountain at night. The room was very comfortable in every way; with smart technology and have smart buttons to control the curtains too. The room also provided with espresso machine. The bathroom area have a  toilet with Japanese tecnology, a shower room and a bathtub.  We were impressed by all of the staff within the hotel, they were able to arrange everything, very friendly and also extremely helpful. Given that the breakfast was not buffet style due to restrictions imposed, the ala-carte portions were big and unlimited. Foods were delicious. Besides The Shoppes, the Four Seasons Hotel KL is right next to KLCC and opposite Avenue K for shopping and dining. Travellers"
"Love the ambience and the service. Top notch! Really love coming back to his hotel. This time for wife’s birthday celebration the staffs are super helpful. Special mention to Amirul and Saima at the front desk, Yvonne and Iqah at Curate. Will definitely come back again."
My husband surprised me with a staycation at Four seasons hotel KL for my 33rd birthday on 20th Feb 2021.He booked junior suite at first.but we were so surprised we got to be upgraded to ambassador suite instead.what a wonderful surprise.  Not just that they really put an effort decorating the suite with a nice baloons and some nice dessert treat.even my daughter shouted WOW upon entering the room 🎉  Mr Zariff and Mr Amirul attended us . There we very polite and friendly.Thank you very much for the wonderful hospitality .i must say this is the best birthday ever!
"First time staying at the hotel. The staff, Gurmit, Kunio and Hazrul helped to plan out a special event arrangement for me, even under 24Hr notice. They worked very efficiently, and went above and beyond to ensure the event went smoothly. They surpassed even the highest expectations that I had! If you ever need assistance with event planning, the 3 staff mentioned are definitely a must contact."
"Had a staycation during the Covid-19 restrictions with the pool,gym and some outlets closed but the excellent staff kept the good vibes going. Audrey, Zaffri were outstanding in the front office while Marvin at the Curate went out of his way to look after us. Breakfast was excellent from the ala carte. We had to skip lunch faced with the irresistible array of choices! Room maintenance needs a little improvement with stains found on the carpet and marble floors though.."
"Went Four Seasons Hotel last 6 January for our Anniversary Dinner. We were serve Caesar Salad & Roasted Scallop for Appetizer, Seafood Chowder & Mushroom (Soup), (Main Course) Seafood Nasi Lemak & Lamb Rack, (Dessert) Mango Kulfi and special Cocktail. The food was simply awesome dan delicious taste. It's just abit disappointed with Seafood Nasi Lemak. The taste was dull and no Nasi Lemak we originally known taste. Hope kitchen can improve on this. Lastly we were serve special Chocolate Brownie for our Anniversary. Thanks to all server Mugilan, Saifullah, Azhar & Adib Malik for organizing such a wonderful table setup, food menu and awesome services by The Pool. Definitely recommend."
"I am very satisfied with the service, cleanliness, and warm welcome from the staff especially Zariff and the Front Desk Team.   Zariff is a true gift to the Four Seasons team. He has an impeccable manner and set a very high standard on what a Guest Service Officer should have.    Apart from that, the bed is super cozy,  in-room entertainment is brilliant, breakfast is marvelous!"
Nice staff... zariff attended me during checkout.. he explained well about the hotel...  excellent guy... during MCO still have 24 hour room service... and the room breakfast was excellent... thank you for the hospitality...
"Had a staycation during Christmas period in 2020. Not impressed, totally not on par with other Four Seasons standard.   I had a room which face KLCC park, however the window is dirty and the experience is ruined. I even notice some crack and broken glasses at the lobby level. Service at the executive lounge need improvement. Swimming pool is small and crowded.   Seriously I have a high expectation towards this hotel, especially this is one of the most premium priced hotel in town. Thank you, next."
Very satisfied with Senthil and the team for the whole dinner service. Food by Chef Jimmy was really good! Guests are very happy with the taste and presentation. Thank you Ellie for accommodating our requests despite the last minute notice. Very professional and helpful team. Would never have it any other way. Thank you Four Seasons!
"Most amazing experience in this hotel. Which is i been assist with this guy name ""Zariff"" from the reception. Super friendly! Hopefully will visit this hotel again. Assist me until at parking lot ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"I had my NYE buffet dinner at Curate. Safe to say i ended 2020 with great experience, superb food, and excellent service. Honorable mention was Sufi (assisted me throughout the night), Ishkandar top service who made me feel like a VIP (eventhough there were so many VIPs inhouse), Adham who assisted me with professional yet comfortable services throughout, and the rest of staffs too. Worth my pennies I will definitely come back real soon."
"Excellent Room,View,Food and Hospitality. Check-in and Check-Out process were fast and hassle-free. Room was splendid with a park view and clean. Even though the executive lounge was closed, the benefit was excellent with the afternoon tea and evening canapé being served at the Curate. Breakfast was good. Lunch and Dinner at Curate and The Lounge were excellent with the service,food, choices and portion. Really love the FS app, as it was a hassle-free to contact the hotel for inquiry,service even the in-room dining order. Overall, Excellent Hotel,Prime Location,Excellent Team and Wonderful Establishments. Really recommended and definitely will come back soon. Good job guys."
"Purpose of my stay was actually a mixture of business and leisure. There was no delay in check in amidst peak period and hence i got continue doing my work comfortably once checked in. Excellent service in all areas from registration, room service and housekeeping. Will definitely come again!!"
Everything was perfect from the moment you checked in. This is our 3rd stay at this hotel (enjoying every moment) and by far this is the best hotel with the best services and hospitality in KL.  The rooms are sparkling clean and sanitized. Comfy bed n pillows and they have turndown service to set your bed before bedtime.  You can request any items they offer from the tab provided in every room. We love that they have kids slippers and robes.   We love the swimming pool and the jacuzzi!
"There are 5 Star Hotels that give lousy service & there are 5 Star Hotels that give outstanding service. Four Seasons KL is one of those 5 Star hotels that provide astonishing service!  Prepare to get your jaw-dropping experience starting from your arrival until departure. Me & my wife went there from Shah Alam for leisure (since we were still not allowed to travel overseas because of the CMCO).  We went there by car & parked our vehicle on level B4. Be sure to park your vehicle on B4 instead of other levels because if not, you’ll need to double validate your parking ticket, which can be quite a hassle. And yes, the parking is complimentary for all hotel guests. Just make sure you take the normal ticket instead of using Touch&Go upon entering because I don’t think they can give"
I was highly disappointed by the service served by a 5 star hotel as my morning was highly ruined by the fact that I was ignored by your employees who were serving sausages while waiting for over 5 minutes.
"I recently stayed for 2 nights at the Four Seasons and was rather disappointed by the less than 5 star experience, especially for a brand like theirs.  I had problems with the hot water in the toilet the day I checked in. When I informed the front desk, 2 maintenance workers were sent and all they did was to run the taps for about 5 - 10 mins, until the hot water came on. I thought the problem was resolved, but later that evening realized that the same problem recurred, but I was too tired to call again. By the way, no one from the front desk called back to check whether the problem was resolved. And the two maintenance guys did not wear gloves etc and made me feel uncomfortable because of hygiene concerns.  The next morning, I informed the front desk of the issue and they were"
"Excellent service everywhere, the KL Four Seasons didn’t disappoint.  From reception (Zariff assisted my 2 teenagers & 3 under 10s) to check-in into our rooms before my husband & I arrived as we were held back elsewhere at checkin time.. thank you for that!) to housekeeping, to gym, to pool, to restaurants (we ate at Curate, Yun House and the executive lounge on this trip) the service was immaculate and very pleasant & courteous.   The children especially found the speakers placed inside the pool (so you get to swim with some calming tunes underwater) and the heated bubble pool, highly amusing! 😊  We had the park-facing corner junior suite and the garden facing room for our teenagers, so although we didn’t have a view of the twin towers, looking at the dancing fountains (for"
"Four Seasons is by far the best and most favorable hotel staycation for our family. We keep on going for short gateway, I think once every 2 months. The last stay on 12 December was indeed the best surprise ever. I would like to express my utmost gratitude to Razif & Saima for handling my booking. The room is extravaganza. Thank you for the kind hospitality. Thank you Hazrul & Jon for the birthday cake and cards in the room!! The room upgrade was unnecessary, however, I was left with joy and full of love by your super awesome gesture :) Thank you team Four Seasons! I love each one of you very much, sorry I couldn't type your individual names here   Btw they upgrade our room to Four Seasons Suite for my birthday!! They make sure our room is perfect (read: pillow selection was on"
"I had a small dinner with family and friends at Yun House and I was so happy with the experience. The food was delicious and the service at Yun House was exceptional and smooth. I also really appreciated the help of the event manager, Ellie, and restaurant manager,  Pauline, to plan everything for me and I didn't stress out at all. A really lovely dinner."
I am writing feedback to appreciate all staff in four season’s kuala lumpur  Thank you very much for assisting us to checking in Kunio san. Thank you for upgrading view as well. Our stay began with you! All frontliner were super friendly and polite. And your smile is like a shining star Ms Farah and Ms Carmen.  My apology that I was not able to record your name but restaurant Curate staffs were so much very much friendly and made my memories unforgettable. I felt like many of you recognised me and addressed me when I enjoyed buffet dinner and breakfast. I really really would love to rate 5 star even more than 5 star to curate staffs. I would believe that there were so much grate guest engagement from every single staff in the hotel . I wish we could extend our stay. definitely
"Four Seasons KL is one of the newer member hotel within the acclaimed hospitality Group, having commenced operation only relatively recently in Nov18.  The location of the hotel cannot be faulted, being within walking distance of the iconic PETRONAS Twin Towers (the tallest twin towers in the world) and its integrated Suria KLCC luxury shopping mall, KLCC Park, Avenue K shopping centre (across the road) and KL Tower (one of the tallest telecommunications tower in the world).  Service from the point of entering the hotel at the front entrance was nothing short of exemplary.  A special commendation for a job well done to the reception team, Mr. Zariff and his colleagues (TV and Kunio) who were particularly friendly and professional in handling our check-in process. Mr. Zariff even"
"I was invited by Omega, the luxury Swiss Watch company, to attend a 1-night event at this property on 17th December 2020. I stayed in corner suite 1011 and it was amazing. I had unobstructed views of the KLCC Park and the surrounding area. Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the Malaysian government's Health & Safety standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the dreaded coronavirus, the event was conducted virtually, with speeches and technical workshops on Omega watches streamed Live from Bienne, Switzerland, straight to the television set in our rooms. Our 3-course dinner was served to us in our rooms too, we had a foie-gras dish for appetizer, half an oven-baked chicken with cranberry sauce for the main course and a cream tart with mixed berries for dessert."
"I checked in here on 17th December, it was my Anniversary and my son’s birthday celebration. From the bellboy, who assisted us to the main entrance lobby to the room, I forgot his name but He’s Indian Tall boy, and then met Mr Rozman (he was the one who bring in my event planner straight away to our room even brought the bouquet of flowers for the surprise) until the receptionist named Kunio and Zariff. They are all Superb!! We got every little things complimentary and special amenities for this celebration from the hotel, they even decorated our room!! I just had a fantastic moment staying there, In addition to that, I must say, when we go for high-tea and evening cocktails, the guy named Iskandar whom always assist my family and We havent finished the meals but he could send"

Thanks fourseasons hotel for the best variety Food I’ve experienced in KL. One of the many reasons make me stay at fourseasons hotel. Yesterday my dinner at Yun House was perfect and today Arabic lunch from Chief Mustafa. Top to the food is the hospitality. Keep it up
"Thank you FSKL and no wonder you're in top 3 in Asia! Mr Gurmit made our stay especially special for our anniversary and birthday for my daughter.  During the pandemic, they kindly made our staycation above par. They prepared the room incredibly with not just flowers, but decorations on bed, chocolates and gifts and so many other things. We were amazed. The food at breakfast was also great spread and we were one of the few staying there. We couldn't fault it at all, even check in was in our room! Wow!  We felt like we were treated like royalty, that is the FS motto I suspect.  They knew our names, they still remember us every time we pass by when we park at the Robinsons to go to KLCC and we pass by the foyer. Loveliest service of any KL hotel we've been in. We did a week of"
"FSKL was among the two hotels that I wanted to stay at during my business trip. It was purely business for me whilst it was a staycation for my parents. The room given was superb. In the year of the pandemic, they even upgraded my room to one with an amazing view.   Admittedly, I had to do a bit of hotel-hopping for work in November. However, I fell in love with FSKL from the moment I stepped into the room. The beds are VERY comfortable which I had to refrain myself from as I had to work late that night. The coffee machine was a lifesaver and choice of pods, awesome!   Breakfast spread was good and value for money, that's for sure!   Ms. Saima & Ms. Sukyee were ultimate rockstars in making my stay an unforgettable & superb one. From the room bookings to check-in and then making"
"Had our staycation on 29th Nov 2020. Our room has been upgraded to pool view instead of city view. The staff explained it was due to the renovation works on the city view side. Upon check in, we were also greeted by the hotel chef as I had specially requested a customised breakfast for my lovely pregnant wife due to her diet restriction.  The room is modern with digital touch to control all the lights, curtain and so on. We were welcomed with a very sweet decoration, hand written greeting card and chocolate Swiss roll for our 2nd wedding anniversary celebration. The room also equipped with iPad where you can directly chat with the hotel staff for dining reservations, pillow and etc. Not to forget, you can also request for pregnancy pillow!! That’s a plus point! Also, you may"
"Stayed 2 nights for my Staycation and absolutely loved it. Was upgraded to Premier View room overlooking KLCC Park which was a bonus. Love the room, cleanliness & amenities were up to expectations of a 5 star hotel.  What made the stay memorable was the excellent service from every department we interacted with...especially Front Desk, Housekeeping and Curate breakfast crew (Nadia was outstanding!).  The Breakfast at Curate was generous and scrumptious.  All in all, the stay was a real treat."

And thank you to Mr. Zafrul for serving us with good food especially mariniere mussels and belgian waffle. 5/5 for everything!"

"Since we were not allowed to move too much between districts. I had booked myself into the Four Seasons KL for some much deserved break.  MY experience from the booking process to the final day of checking out was very pleasant and smooth.  My queries via emails were answered in less than 24 hours, and despite my last minute booking, they ensured I had sufficient information prior to arriving.  At the check in desks the process was quick, I was informed about the chat and Apps that they had.  I had booked the spa and they had confirmed my bookings a day before I arrived, with suggested packages to look into.  My spa therapist Kina was an absolute gem. She really put me at ease after months of being afraid to go for a massage.  She was really experienced and I had a great"
"Bar is absolutely stunning. Drinks were excellent. Julian is amazing. We asked if there’s any cakes available and simply mentioned it’s my friend’s birthday. Since it’s ard 10pm, he said he has to check first. After ten mins, he came with a cake and candle. We were all in shocked as he’s very busy in serving here and there. He deserves all the credits!"

Despite of the many offers we received from other hotels, we decided stayed at Four Seasons because of the unbeatable deal you offered to us!  It was a very good decision. We enjoy the peace and quiet we needed. Not to forget the very high quality in all the hotel facilities!   Every staff member with whom we came in contact was very attentive, kind, friendly and professional including receptionist especially Veen Neer and Carmen, housekeeping, restaurant staff and conceirge team.  I just wanted to let you know that how we valued all the efforts, how impressive and gracious and how greatly we appreciate that the whole staff team did for us.

"We group of family were stayed at Four Seasons Hotel Kuala Lumpur for birthday celebration and it was held so amazingly!     My sincere thanks to entire Hotel staff, and I am glad to mention some of an individual who went extra mile just to make our celebration even better! First, I would like to pay my sincere thanks to ""Mr. Zahrizan"" for being generous by upgrading our room to upper category.     Secondly Thanking to AGEM ""Mr. Gurmit"", ""Hazrul"" and ""Nicolas"" who decorated our room with Balloons, Towel made Swans & Elephants placed in the bed it was just amazing!

We will certainly tell our friends about you, and look forward to returning soon.  Sincerely,  A."
"With Four Seasons famed internationally with their service quality levels, FSKL did not disappoint. From the room booking where Isaac did a fantastic job ensuring my birthday staycation was smooth and memorable (an upgrade, a free valet parking, reserving a table at Bar Trigona was a major plus). Huge difference is that he also followed through and updated the arrangements via call and email; that he also personally greeted me and ensure my check-in is right before I adjourn to my room.   To comment in overall, attitude and service level by various departments are simply exceptional - ALL OF THEM would go all out, to ensure all customers’ needs are fulfilled. The amazing part is they are sincere, to make your day.   At the Spa, reception is courteous and masseuse is skillful;"
