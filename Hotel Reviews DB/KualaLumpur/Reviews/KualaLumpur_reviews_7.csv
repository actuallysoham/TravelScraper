"We stayed in W for 2 nights. Overall we had enjoyed quite alot during our stay. We stayed in a room with twins tower view and it had been outstanding. Room amenities were complete enough to make one feel comfortable.   Food had also been good quality - breakfast at Flock was splendid in terms of quality and varieties. We also took a package which included set dinner - which had also been enjoyable.  Pool at wet deck offers wonderful views which we had enjoyed alot of our time swimming there.   There were however some minor misses in terms of booking, probably due to large number of guests checking in same time with us. But overall I think hotel management had done its level best and I appreciate all the staff for their excellent services throughout our stay that made it a"
"We spent an awesome weekend at W hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Nice contemporary marvelous suite, delicious food and a great relaxing SPA massage...Excellent service! We will come back soon! Alexander and family"
The beds are comfortable and the rooms are fitted to the highest standard.  The gym has the best equipment ever and the view from the pool is one to die for. They have excellent restaurants within this luxury hotel. The location is the best in this city. Located a short distance away is the K Avenue  LRT Station.
"Great meal in Flock on Retox deal - fabulous choice of lovely dishes and good drinks deal. Followed by best Amaretto Sour ever in the Woo Bar. Maybe not the flashiest cocktail in the book but the bartender knew how to create a classic. Excellent service from all the crew, especially Farhan."
"IT was a great weekend at W HOtel with my girls, nice room with nice ambience. Service was good from Peshwin, Jojo & Meliha. They went the extra mile to make us comfortable & made our stay memorable. Love the room as well!"
"Booked standard room and utilise my platinum suite night certificate for suite upgraded. Given Marvellous suite, one of the most popular suite in Instagram/ FB  KIDS all enjoyed the room amenities such as big bath tub, comfy bed, cushy sofa , etc Overall feeling great. Food delicious. Pool with Klcc view. Fascinating scenery from room  About staff, all good. I dun really interact or asking help as I‚Äôm busy with kids .  I‚Äôm sure will return to this hotel again in near future."
"Great place for a fun weekend staycation with the family. This hotel is very popular during the weekends.  We had a lovely Marvelous Suite for our birthday. Love the spacious and funky room, and the suite was well equip with a generous range of Bliss amenities. The staffs are W are super attentive everywhere we go (thank you Mr Metzner and your amazing team!) and we received excellent titanium recognition here. üéâ Breakfast is delicious with plenty of choices. The view of KLCC, if you sit at the outside deck during breakfast , is priceless. The rooftop pool and bar serve  a variety of great food and cocktails too. üòçüòç"
"Great hotel& facility Nice food and beverage (especially the cocktail) Excellent Staff Even during MCO period, the food and facility quality remain and all SOP are at place to ensure safety Definitely will come again."
"Everything was great except 1) poorly managed CMCO SOP in swimming pool - we stayed 3 days but only on the 3rd somebody stopped us from getting to the swimming pool as she calculated the limit of pax inside exceeded 15 pax. We asked y only last day somebody checked, she said she was not working for the past 2 days. For the past days, the crowd was confirmed exceed 15 pax. At least 30+ 2) water leak from the top window I guess to the windows on my room, as the window frame is steel, we were wondering what sound was it... Initially we thought the window is going to break, only end out seeing the water leak from the top of the floors (can't see the origin of leak) 3) chocolate stain on spoon from breakfast restaurant - need to clean properly."
"My lunch buffet experiences in W hotel is really awesome. I unable to reserve enough tummy space for all the presented food.   All the hotel staff is like really friendly and helpful. Especially when I am looking around for the waiter, they could notice me within a few second.   I am really satisfied with all their food served especially big scallops, smoked salmon, king crabs, prawns as well as the dessert sections. The chocolate under the desserts section are all made in Malaysia, MALAYSIA BOLEH!  Besides, their chawamushi is the BEST! Is a MUST TRY food in W.  I have it for 3 bowls, and I dont feel enought for the chawamushi!  Overall, W hotel is a wonderful place to visit. I looking forward to the next visit. Thankiewww for all the staff who bringing me a delightful"
"This my 2nd times staying over the hotel, overall nothing much to complete nor bad service about it. The front desk chinese lady trying her best to access me. ( I think she a newbie ) will stay again when I'm around town.  Check in 22/03/2021 room 2003."

"i used to stay here few time back. and recommend many friends to stay here as their front desk, rooms, facilities are really awesome. but their reservation /phone call customer service are the worst. never pay attention to customer during call, poor english, and rude attitude. they even hang up customers call when they can provide advice. this's not a 5 star hotel customer service level, is worst than 1 star. this bad customer service experience are among the worst i had ever encounter..never will recommend again"
"Stayed on the 6th-7th March weekend in the Studio Suite as part of our belated birthday weekend.  Living La Vida Local package included breakfast + dinner.   (We were coming from a night at the EQ, so a lot of comparison to be made as both hotels are similar in price.)  PRE-ARRIVAL/CHECK-IN   Contacted by Maliha via WhatsApp on the eve of my arrival which was a nice touch. Usually, hotels would reach out via email. Requested for an early check-in but was told that a lot of rooms had back-to-back reservations, but she would inform if our room was ready earlier. However, half hour before check-in time was informed that there was a slight delay in getting our suite ready as they had a late check-out. We were already checking out of EQ at this point and was just hoping that they"
"Been to a Wet Deck few times already and it was awesome all  the time. I love the ambiance and spectacular view. Most of all Wet Deck staff  Azlan very friendly,helpful and give a good service.

"Part of the Marriott group of hotels, the W hotel is city centre located near all shopping, retail and transport. Perfect views of the twin towers from the pool deck and the all day dining restaurant."
We are here in celebration of my Dad's 71st birthday. He is very fond of the Twin Tower. We have stayed at majority of  hotels with Twin Tower views. We were a bit skeptical to choose W because we have small kids and W being recognized as a hype hotel for the young ones might not be suitable for us with kids around.  We were totally wrong!!! It was a hotel with   Wonderful hospitality that made us feel very much Welcome. The kids love it and wanted to be back again.  We took the Living La Vida local package and it was WORTH it!!!  My utmost Thank You to the following people who were out there giving us a Wonderful service and experience.  1. Harvi - who attended to my queries from the start and ensured all my requests were taken care.  2. Ashley - who handled my check in and out
"I went to Wet Deck at W Kuala Lumpur,this guy name Azlan is a bartender there,he is very helpful,fast service,very very friendly and he  is good in what he do.Been there few times with all my friends and family yet still his service always the top Good job Azlan and Wet Deck people üëçüëçüëçüëç See u soon"
The Hi-Tea that we had was amazing and one of a kind that we have ever had. Dennis was very helpful as he made the service wonderful and he had a great explanation. Thanks so much for making our day !
"Food and ambience was amazing. Never felt such an experience before as it was our first time here. Surely is a place to recommend. The service staff was attentive and funny as well, applause Dennis for the service,  Date of visit: 28 February  Place: WooBar"
"So, this is the 3rd review and saving the best for the last in a series of 3 progressive review covering the W Hotel KL. 3rd review since this is our family's 3rd stay at W hotel. Progressive, since the 1st stay was at the more basic Spectacular room, 2nd stay was at a Marvelous Suite and the 3rd stay, the finale - EXTREME WOW or EWOW suite.  EWOW - this is the pinnacle of W Hotel KL and in W brand, is the priciest, biggest, most elaborate, luxurious, blah, blah..... suite you can get. Not every W branded hotel globally have a EWOW suite, though most will have this.   Although categorized as luxury by Marriott, W hotels doesn't follow the classical luxury as carried by other Marriott brands (RC, St R. JWM & non-Marriott  like 4S, MO, GH etc). And so, like all other rooms in W,"
"A place to relax with friends ..... arrived at the table don‚Äôt know what to order üôÑ a staff out of the bar continues to recommend and explain about food at the wet deck ..? After ordering food, he continued for a special cocktail drink KUALA LOCCO and Melonyy which is quite tasty and amazing ... He is very friendly for jokes until he does not stop smiling Tq Cool guy Azlan Bartender‚ò∫Ô∏è  #philippinessmalaysia"
"One of my favorite brands of Marriott...i strongly suggest the Yan Chinese Restaurant, good food and great service by its Manager and her team...Bravo and keep it up! A must visit place for me and family whenever we stay in..."
"I have a great experience stay at W hotel , you will get surprise when roll up the sunblind , KLCC view and KL tower view just awesome ! And I order 24 hours room service was delicious ! I really love it so much !"
"Ok those that might read my once in a while posts will know I like quality !!   I don't mind paying for it.  The bi weekly brunch at the W Hotel (out of MCO) is fabulous !! Good food selection for the cost !!! Book early as it gets full, take the drinks package as you will easily drink what you pay up front. Take friends too, it currently has cool music with a awesome saxophonist playing along with the chill out tracks.  You will love the atmosphere, if you do go say hello to Christian the GM tell him I sent you.  Enjoy !!!"
"We checked in on 24-December for Christmas eve buffet at Flock and one night stay, also went to Wet Deck for tea break and nice klcc view, overall a comfortable stay with great service from the staff.   Thanks for the treats and card from the hotel."
"Would like to give a shout out to Farhan and Ruth from the banquet team who took care of us during the 3-day meeting on 9-11 January 2021. They were attentive and always cheerful taking care of all the fussy participants. No request was too hard. I had mentioned to a fellow participant that I love to eat cili padi with my meals. I was pleasantly surprised that I was given cili padi with my main dish the next day ü•∞ Farhan also helped arranged for napkins and  a few lights for my group's presentation. Well done and keep up the good work. üéâüéâ Whatever, whenever!"
"Outstanding hospitality by W Kuala Lumpur. Special thank you to Ms Ly Ling for a great arrangement for our short vacay (immediate contact me upon booking confirmation and easy to arrange), also million of thanks to Wet Deck team for helping us during birthday dinner, also received birthday cake and gift from the hotel, outstanding KLCC view from Wet Deck, sure to come back!"
"The best memories for 2020! In love every single about this hotel. The design was fantastic! The staff was super friendly! The facilities was awesome! I stay for celebrating my birthday with friends. Everything was perfect and excellent. The view from Wet Deck was spectacular facing the famous tallest twin tower, KLCC. I really enjoy the view at Wet Deck! My room was upgraded facing to KLCC, that make me feel so happy and thankful. All of the staff was very nice! During my checking time, Mr Christian/GM come to greet and meet me. That make me feel special and feel ‚Äòhome sweet home‚Äô. Special thanks to Lay Ling, the super awesome & friendly Duty Manager. Not forget to Ashley and Meliha, thank you for the warm welcome and special arrangement. Definitely i will repeat my stay at W"
Friendly and very accomodating staffs. Poolside bar with great view of the twin tower. Comfy bed. Good food (breakfast and dinner buffet) at the Flock. Came back feeling refreshed and satisified. Worth another stay.
"Book a night to have pre-birthday celebration here, the service was great, everyone was so friendly especially Sin Ling from front desk.  I complained about the room next door was making noise all night and the duty manager comes out right away to apologise. Other than this I was satisfied with the stay, the bed was so comfortable and toilet are clean, our room facing KLCC which gives a perfect view, will definitely come back for a staycation next time."
"NOTE: Visit the website in my profile for the full review and more photos.  Flawless experience from the beginning to the end. Great breakfast, location and views. Staff were amazing throughout.   Definitely take the opportunity to stay in this right now as rates are much lower than usual.  The Wow Suite was spectacular.  Thank you W Kuala Lumpur!"
"Stay for birthday trip and received lots of warm wishes from staffs. In this pandemic period, they did sterilize every corner and record info of guests.  I did order my in room dining breakfast as the restaurant Flock was close down for upgrades at the moment. Most recommend breakfast is Roti Canai with sambal prawn.  Definitely will going to have another stay in the future.  Just a little comment on sound-proofing as I kept hearing the door opened from other guests but I thought my door open. It might be disturbance for someone sensitive to sound."
"I have stayed for 2 nights as a solo guest in January 2020, therefore, lucky enough to avoid the pandemics. And it was a superb stay for many reasons. The core proposal of the W brand may not be suitable for all types of guests, however, it's definitely the best fit unmissable choice for those young savvy travelers who seek for high standard hospitality in the best locations and impressive ambience. The amazing view of the KLCC is an event apart. Thank you guys!"
"First time to W brand, despite not a fan of colorful ambience however it does show uniqueness.  My loyalty being appreciated. Little issue before check in fortunately solved swiftly by the director of rooms.  As expected since the hotel is too close with twin towers that‚Äôs good & bad.  WIP access is impressive at wet deck! Love the margarita & samurai.  There are staffs enlighten my stay, Sin Ling, Ehsan, Nana & Meliha. Some shows inconsistency services, hope you guys treat all customers equally, show judging eyes is not cool."
"I have stayed there twice the last 3 months with my family, and we all love the hotel. There is a great vibe at the hotel and the staff is great. I will recommend to get a hotel with the twin tower view, and the premium for this is minimal.  We have tried their high tea, detox Sunday brunch and food in general, and the food is fantastic and is worth just a stop for a great meal.  The strongest point is however their Wet deck with the amazing view, and the great laidback pool area.  We will definitely return again in 2021 for another staycation or two!"
"Been to Wet Deck on 12/12/2020..having my birthday dinner with friends with the amazing view of klcc.. Nice pizza, pasta and sweet potato fries, we order twice... Been entertain/hosting by Ai from the beginning... Very friendly,make sure that we are ok with the seating.. feel that we have known forever.. Thank you so much Ai and all the team.. Will come back again.. To chill and relax.."
"My friend and I did a staycation sometime in Oct 2020 since we couldnt go outstation.  Basically it‚Äôs a must to visit it‚Äôs wet deck and have a few beers be it day time or night time. Overall the staff provided superb services as they contacted me prior to check in and attended to each and every request in a very friendly manner. Special mention to Christian Metzner who took time to read my review and responded personally. Oh well, stay stylish and fabulous!"
"I was here for 2 nights to end my Asia trip and boy was it the best way to go out with a bang. This was before COVID hit to I can only speak for an experience when the hotel was in full swing and at capacity.  I booked a standard room, but was kindly upgraded to a suite due to my hotel reward status and boy was that suite incredible! The views are attached of the amazing towers which can be seen in full view from the bedroom! The room is well equipped for everything, even for a working set up as I had to log in quite a bit. The bathroom is so snazzy and always my favourite when staying at the W hotels.  Staff are so friendly, always kind and willing to help.   I cannot speak for the restaurants other than breakfast, as I ate out most of the trip but the breakfast selection was"
"WONDERFUL EWOW SUITE for a birthday treat! We were very happy to find a place to be pampered. From the valet, to the warm reception, everyone was very kind. A special thank you to Harvi and Fieza who made our stay extra special.   The suite was spectacular with our very own private pool. It was truly a real treat to stay here. No request was too great for the team to satisfy. Thank you and we will be back soon!"
"This is a very specific review of a staycation at W Hotel during the M'sian Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO) period. This review may not be applicable during normal times, as the stay environment may be different. This review is applicable to any residence in M'sia thinking of a staycation at W Hotel during this period. And especially if you are a  Platinum/Titanium/Ambassador Elite Member.  Perhaps during this difficult times for the travel industry, most hotels have come up with some pretty interesting and good staycation packages which caters for locals.   W Hotel had come up with one particular package - AMP UP YOUR STAY. This package includes a 2 nights stay with a RM1000 hotel credit, which is applicable to most of the Hotel restaurants (excluding Willow) and the"
"I usually visit W Kuala Lumpur and I always leave happy, but tonight more than happy! We had the best waiter on our table, Harry! He is so funny, polite and always attentive at what customers want and need! W is very lucky to have him as staff, more waiters like Harry are needed in Malaysia!! Thank you W, Thank you Harry!"
"The room was soo great and comfy  , also my host , shahrul was very helping . The view from my room is soo nice at night and morning . Such a spectacular view .  Will come again of course ! One of the best hotel i ever stay !"
"W Hotel KL is the best hotel in kuala lumpur because of it excellent service from W hotel staffs . Even though currently we are facing pandemic Covid-19 ,hotel staff still keep up high service and follow government SOP. Iam really appreciate excellent service from Mr Harvi, Duty Manager, Ms Ashley & Ms Lin Ling, front desk agent for giving me welcome gift, Mr Ehsan welcome ambassador and Meliha for your lovely welcome note. Iam really appreciate exception service and I really recommending this hotel to frequent traveler, businessman and family. The view from Wet deck at 12th floor was spectacular facing the world famous tallest twin tower ,KLCC. The suite very cosy and nice view especially facing KLCC. Thank you again to Mr Harvi for making our trip memorable and beautiful"
"With COVID 19 forcing me to work from home, I desperately needed to get out of the house a day. I booked a room for one night with the goal of pampering myself with everything W hotels are known for.  I am amazed how, during this pandemic, the manage to keep up the high service standards even more for BonVoy Gold member like me.  The entire staff made us feel like at home with casual friendly talk - be it at bar or the restaurant.  They are swift to accommodate for customers‚Äô need when things suddenly change like torrential rain by the Wet Bar, which had guest seamlessly relocating to the woobar.  The local cocktails are very good and plenty of booze in it.  The smoked ceviche, by the way, is worth ordering twice."
"Excellent stay! We really enjoyed our stay at W. The staff were very approachable & helpful. The suite was very cozy & good with comfortable furnitures. The in-room breakfast also was really good. Not to mention, the Wetdeck at 12th floor. Its Really a good place to chill with a nice view. Overall, It was a wonderful experience at W. Thanks so much. We would definitely stay here again!"
Was amazing service by the bartenderüòäaslan this my second time come and visit wetdeck i like the sunset and view of course the cocktails with the blue colour he makes for us super taste  Thnks and we will visit again That picture taken from goggle wetdeck website that guy (aslan)
"Great experience though for just 1 night stay for my wife's birthday. Helpful and friendly staff, namely Eric. Sophisticated room design. Too bad swimming pool is closed due to CMCO. Will definitely come back again!"
"I live in Sydney, Australia but had to be back to Malaysia to look after my mom who had stroke. My birthday was on the 30th Oct however my husband and in laws wanted to treat me to get some rest and a nice bath. W has always been my fav and any city that has a W Hotel i would definitelt stay at.   This is the first time im checking in the W in KL and i cant express how hospitalble every single staff has been from the beginning until the end of my stay! I wanted to book a spectacular room but Pavan convinced i would much enjoy the Marvelous Suite but then the Room Director Sudhir decided to surprise me with a better room.   I cant believe they surprised me with a WoW room! I was give n a complimentary drink to wait while they sanitize the room and once it was ready i went up"
It was my first time in Woodbar though it was closed during CMCO I was warmly greeted by Erul the welcome ambassador WKL. It was such a great experience as the ambience was very cosy and relaxing along with Erul keeping me company as I was waiting for my friends. I was also welcomed with a detox shot which was very energising. Thank you Erul for your kind hospitality and sharing your thoughts about the hotel and the services they have. I am pleased to have step foot at level 8 and will definitely come back to dine there. What a pleasant service and hospitality once again it was a lovely evening at W.
"Stylish, sleek and dimly lit, The W in Kuala Lumpur is a luxurious vibrant hotel with clever, funny touches in their design and an energy of possibility.   Was it the right place for two married normals to celebrate 20 years together? Absolutely, why not? We enjoyed cocktails and a hookah amidst the beautiful young rich kids in designer clothes and bottle services and just took in the stunning view of the twin towers. No one minded mom and dad giggling like teenagers again at a private table, making jokes about movies they‚Äôve probably never even heard of.   Lots of pretty saucy touches to the hotel room, mirrors above the bed, intimacy kits, chocolate body paint. If you‚Äôre a beautiful rich horny person, this place is for you! Or hey, if you‚Äôre a couple of married norms looking"
"W team are doing great in sanitising & maintaining hygiene for common area & room. Thanks for the effort on providing worry-free for my stay during this pendamic.   Moreover, definitely best suite with best & complete view for both KLCC & KL tower in town. Also special thanks W team for the arrangement of upgrading room, superb hearty & top-notch service ever.  Yen Restaurant, a savory cook in KL, certainly another highlight for dining in this city.   Much appreciate with excellent service, Mr Sudhir."
This was to celebrate a special occasion with my partner. Absolutely stunning decorations in room and stylish design. The pool is just spectacular with the view of the twin tower. You would want to take a well posed picture there! Food and drinks are super cheap compared to W in other countries.
"Thank you to WKL Sales/Event/Banquet team for putting up an excellent meeting arrangement for us.  Thank u Fazrin & Farhan from Banquet who took care of all our needs during the event, Lisa & Teoh for helping us put together this event.  We have 13 more training days to spend at WKL. Looking forward to continuous good service in the future."
"Celebrated my birthday with my SO just yesterday, was surprised at how posh-looking the place was. We were upgraded to a nice corner room which was already a very pleasant surprise and was greeted with a little cake + balloons to celebrate the occasion. The view of the twin towers at the pool deck was amazing, even our hotel room allowed us to soak in the twin towers in all its beauty   We ended our stay with lunch at Yen Cantonese restaurant, and since it was our first time there, we asked one of the staff to recommend some of the delicacies to us. Mr Elvin Wong's recommendations was spot on and a total delight as we absolutely enjoyed the Xiao Long bao and the ""Ha gao"". He even went as far as preparing another small customized birthday cupcake for me upon hearing that we were"
"We stayed on the 6th October and it was fantastic, probably the best Hotel in KL. Excellent service, best location. Very well designed rooms and lots of details in the rooms which are absolutely perfect. Great time at the bar and breakfast at Flock was equally good. Highly recommended to any business or leisure traveller."
"Got pleasantly suprised by the W team when we booked this specatular room for my birthday. They really put a lot of attention to all the details and we were amazed. Splendid room, amazing amenities, service and everything. Had dinner at the Wet Deck and the pizza was exceptional. Breakfast the next day at Flock was also amazing. Will be back surely next time if we want a getaway to KL. Special mention to Benedict (Flock Manager) and Melanie (Flock) together with the Meliha and Ashley who really surprised us with the details in our room.   Thank you again W."
"We stayed here for a weekend staycation and the experience was very good!  We had a great time in afternoon at the pool with marvelous view of the Petronas Towers. Later we visited the spa for a relaxing massage. The room was very nice, modern with view of the towers and very comfortable. Diner was in the Cantonese restaurant Yen, so far the best Cantonese food we have had in our 3 years stay in KL. To end the night we visited the Wetdeck, were it was (socially distanced) crowded, great atmosphere, good music and delicious cocktails. Breakfast at Flock restaurant was super, lot of choices and very high quality. All together the perfect staycation and definitely would recommend!"
"We stayed for 4D 3N..The experience was awesome. My first appreciation is for their service..TOP Class! The staffs at Flock were very humble, helpful and kind..Thanks to Melanie,Azila,Shoburn,Hanis,Nathan,Suria and Eizlan.. Every morning they gave us a great positive vibe. Breakfast was very tasty and wonderful presentation- kudos to the Chef and team. Wet Deck was located at a superb site with great KLCC view. There were 2 young Indian boys as waiter who were very helpful and humble. I am sorry to not remember their name. Our room was the Marvelous Suite which was super big and clean. Housekeeping were very helpful and fast. In room dining was above expectation as well.. We will definitely return to W KL simply because their service!! Pease keep up your good work. Those humble"
"Visited Wet Deck for a friend‚Äôs birthday recently. Amazing view, delicious food, and the service was over the top. Price is also affordable. And shoutout to Lun for the most efficient service, super professional and also friendly, making it a comfortable and a smooth birthday dinner for us. Cheers."

"We just had a stay over this weekend at W Hotel in the Marvellous room for 2 nights. And it was indeed awesome! Here's what we thought: 1. The hotel is doing an excellent job of meeting all the RMCO guidelines, down from the breakfast table to check in.  2. We had requested an early check in but our room wasn't ready due to a late check-out. So we were parked in another room for few hours & given a late check out. This was much appreciated.  3. The Marvellous room is highly recommended. The interiors are so cleverly done & amenities provided are excellent. This holds true for the entire hotel i think. 4. Breakfast (buffets on Sundays only) are very good & staff attentive.  5. Spa service was excellent & both of us enjoyed it thoroughly.  6. The Suria mall is just 2 mins away &"
"If you looking for typical 5 stars hotel with finest service, W is not for you. W hotel is fun, outgoing and yet caring in enough to make your stay memorable. I would like to say thank you to Christian ( GM), Kristine (Reception) and Melanie (Flock restaurant), for the outstanding service and arrangement, especially Melanie  who treat me like a close friend, with all the small talk and close friends tips for my stay at the the hotel.  The marvelous suite is really wow, wow and wow... pictures says the thousands words.  I  tried the spa also, it is so amazing and wow wow and wow, best massage üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ever. I will definitely come back and even one of my friend decided to book after my review. Thank you W Hotel. LOVE üíò you guys."
"Stayed several time in W KL, and this time was to give my kids a delayed Birthday celebration, emailed W insider Meliha about it and Kristine gave us an amazing arrangement, room was upgraded , we got W original Chocolate cake, balloons and also my kids photos were printed. The team really spend their effort to take care our stay.  Flock and Pool side bar Wet are still as good as before, Ben and his teammates are always keen to serve their guests, very happy to see them as COVID have limited my travelling this year. Reception staffs are very friendly and staffs at the gym and pool very attentive as well, W KL pool is just a fantastic place to relax.  Just can‚Äôt wait to plan my next stay in W KL again. We enjoyed our short vacation with W KL."
"Our 1 night staycation in Aug 2020 to celebrate our anniversary was nothing short of ‚ÄúMarvelous‚Äù!   The service upon arrival at the front counter was good, Meliha greeted us and it was a classy welcome. The complimentary room upgrade was a pleasant surprise and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Marvelous suite including the Anniversary room set up.   Special mention to ~ Kristine and Meliha (W Insider) who both were nothing short of Fabulous, they planned the surprise for our anniversary and we‚Äôre perfect. A momentous occasion which my wife and I will cherish for years to come.  The Wet Deck experience was awesome including the pool boy(s) + Flock for the breakfast. Service was of a high quality, everyone was welcome and smiling, accommodating our requests which"
New and modern hotel. Room was clean and well kept. Able to use mobile phone as room key which is great as you don't have to carry the usual key card. Staff friendly and accommodating. Only feedback would be Flock restaurant's music was too loud during the buffet dinner. Music should be just in the background and not overpower table conversation. Otherwise great hotel.
"We really enjoyed our stay in W KL. This is by far one of the most attentive & chic hotel, even before the actual stay itself. Received WhatsApp (not many will go to that extend, mainly using mail) from W Insider - Kristine. She is so friendly & helpful, top notch service. The moment we stepped into W, it was very welcoming from concierge to front desk team. Well done! They have a very fun & chic interior design and pool. My daughter & I love spending our time there, doing people watching, playing with water & all the fun floaters that were available! üíó Despite having a bath tub in the room. The W Deck drinks were also very creative & nice. My fave was their Suda-Tuak-Ka. Food at Yen was delicious too, we had the buffet dim sum. Only set back was, the view from our room. Was"
Booked a night stay for my parents and thanks to Meliha for making their stay great! Meliha was very responsive to all my inquiries and helped me to prepare a handwritten message for my parents. The room is spacious with view amazing view of the twin towers. My parents enjoyed their stay very much thanks to Meliha and everyone at the hotel. Definitely will stay again!
"Room was flawless with great view as usual, never a let down. Front office team is superb, courteous and attentive. The main highlight of W KL is Food & Beverage quality, top notch! Definitely not about the quantity but rather quality. The croissants was perfect, flakey and buttery as well as the pain au chocolat, easily the best I‚Äôve tried in KL. Well done to Chef Adam and the team!"
"This was our 3rd stay back here and we loved every minute of it. W Kuala Lumpur has the complete package! Whatever/Whenever is W Hotel‚Äôs motto and this property lives up to it. We loved the amazing Marvelous suite, the top-notch and attentive service, and the exquisite food here. They have enough restaurants and bars, superb activities such as spa, gym and swimming pool in the hotel to make us stay in the hotel. I‚Äôd recommend trying the AWAY Spa, Chinese food at YEN and the Sunday Retox Brunch. The other highlight of our stay was the pool overlooking the amazing Twin Towers. Definitely one of the best views in town!"
"It's quite rare for a chain hotel to have characteristics and charm of a boutique hotel. But W has proven that it is possible  The room interior is amazing, and the view from the spectacular room is to die foor. Imagine waking up with the petronas twin tower in front of you.   2 queen beds were just perfect for a small family, with aplenty of spaces still available in the room  Amazing service too, considering the hotel industry is struggling, n they probably had to downsize the number of staff. But the quality of the service was unaffected"
Really attractive Hotel. We stayed there for two nights. staff was excellent and helpful. Pool area is the best. we had awesome Dinner there at the restaurant and its memorable. foods are delicious and serving attractively. quite expensive but they got best Collection of International and Asian Cuisines.
"Overpriced and overrated. I guess the price is because of the location. I expected more as review from tripadvisor is very good. Unfortunately, I did not get what I expected. Firstly I message their FB to ask for birthday celebration, they send me an email Add to insider ,  so I email, and no reply until the day I arrive. I had also mention it when I did the booking via Agoda stating that I‚Äôm celebrating a birthday. Also, nothing. Check in is smooth,  early check in allowed. Then I call to reception to inform about birthday, and they arrange a cake and balloon. Breakfast is dine in, mentioned 9.30 but by 9.50 only they called to inform that there will be delay. Food presentation is good, but taste is so so only. Bed is comfortable , room view is Kl tower, bathtub is not clean"
"When it comes to a W Hotel, you either will just love it or hate it. There isn't a middle ground. I personally am a fanboy when it comes to the brand. It is loud, fun, with a touch of pampering and glitzy glamour that comes along with it.   WKL  is one of my favorite so far. Amazing people, amazing rooms, amazing view an amazing pool and amazing FOOD, (yes i said Food).   I will sound like a broken record if I talk about how the room is and how the service is over here. When we come back to a hotel repeatedly, it is somewhere we know that has done it right.   Yen and Flock are two amazing F&B outlet. The dimsum is to die for! And Flock has the most amazing breakfast spread. I may rate them the best breakfast in the city? its a very close call but it is on the top of our list."
"I stayed here for a 3D/2N staycation with my boyfriend to celebrate our 1st year together. We chose this hotel cause of its great location in KL City Centre and based on all the great reviews we have read online. We received a pre-arrival email from Kristine (W Insider) and were glad we met her during our check-in. We booked a standard Wonderful Room, but Kristine and Sudhir (Director of Rooms) surprised us with a 5-tier upgrade to their Marvellous Suite... WOW!!! Literally W-O-W!  The W Insider team did a fantastic job at arranging cute and romantic amenities for me and my boyfriend. They even set up a handful of colourful helium balloons to further heighten the 'WOW factor'. I had a hard time eating the amenities because they were simply too pretty!  The suite was very"
"The W Kuala Lumpur is easily one of the best and certainly the greatest value W‚Äôs I have had the pleasure of staying with. Of the 50 plus locations in some 25 countries and my wife and I have experienced many past stays at more than 17 W's in some 13 countries throughout Asia, Europe, North, Central and South America as well the Middle East and most frequently at Bali.   Over our three night stay, amongst the many standout features of this relatively new hotel opened in August 2018 included   -the superb and massive marvellous suite which probably has the best double shower ever;  -the excellent and discreet morning and evening housekeeping;  -the generous Titanium Elite recognition which includes a full nightly happy hour at 6.30pm with hot and varied snacks;  -an exceptional"
"Last Sunday 29 Feb, I went to W Hotel had a breakfast with my friends.  I like Flock restaurant design and environment, stylish and modern Their breakfast is buffet style and their also have some their signature breakfast in their menu, I like their food especially smoked salmon egg benny, this is from their menu, i highly recommended.  Their service is bravo, why i said so ? Because when i entered Flock, their staff even is busy to clear table, they still will look at each customers and talk friendly and giving warm services. This is how i feel at their professional services.  A good compliment i would like to give a staff named Hanis, because he is the person who recommend the smoked salmon egg benny, haha, he is a friendly person and he know how to give some suggestions to"
What can i say from the moment we checked in we were welcomed warmly by the staff for our anniversay.There is one person in the hotel that made the whole experience so much better with his warm presence and all over helpfulness and taht person is Sudhir.If you are reading this Mr Metzner you have an individual here who takes your hotel to another level with his persona he is an asset to your hotel and the marriot brand there is not enough words to describe his service and help we recieved from him.Thank you Sudhir you made our stay at the W kuala lumpur one of the best we have had in any city and wont ever forget you.Mr Metzner  look after this gentleman he is what makes your hotel a cut above the rest. P.odedra
"We have the best times of our trip staying in this hotel. The w insider, Meliha arranged nice cakes, printed our photos and set up our room with rose petals for our anniversary.  The room was nice and spacious. Overall it was a comfortable and happy stay for us.  The design of the hotel is great and the staff service is amazing."
A very modern n chic place to stay.... infact we stayed twice in our malaysian trip The decor is really modern nice colors.... the moment you enter the lobby it feels like youve entered a bar... since we are a muslim family i got worried that maybe we have booked a wrong place but everything turned out fine Really good wifi many choices at breakfast perfect view from our suite of the pool and petronas The curtain blinds were really cool 2 things i ddnt enjoy 1: the toilets can not be locked ü•¥ 2: the cleaners do not do their job properly..... black surfaces had amazing amiunts of dust settled on thm (on both our stays) the stains that i noticed on piwder room shelf were not cleaned throught our stay
"Booked a room for the start of our honeymoon trip right after our wedding and it was fantastic! We were greeted accordingly by all the hosts and had a smooth check-in. We were also given a late check out and to our surprise, we were upgraded to a better room category complete with a cute honeymoon set up! Little that they know that I was a Marriott employee and would care for all the little details of my trip but they still exceeded my expectations - so bravo and big thank you to the W KL team, from the check in to the breakfast staff, bellboys and housekeepers, you have all made our stay wonderful and one of a kind ‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Well, what can I say. Just great. Brilliant location and view of the Petronas Towers. Rooms are fantastic (#1604). Staff are super friendly and we will definitely be back our next KL visit. Opted not to take breakfast because we were up and out but had a very nice meal in the YEN Cantonese restaurant. Wet Deck is a nice area for a G&T it three in the backdrop of the Towers"
"We booked for 2 nights the marvellous suite and got upgraded to the 130m2 WOW suite, which was truly amazing with the beautiful views and elevated ceilings. Decor was great and room was very clean. Hotel dining had also exceed our expectation, although it was a shame that we didn‚Äôt have the chance to try the breakfast.  Another highlight was the Wet-Deck pool bar ‚Äî superb view of the Petronas towers and overall a nice bar area.  Only negative was the business Center ‚Äî not that W is a business hotel or anyone really needs one when at W, but I happened to have been doing some urgent work. They had two computers available in the business Center just outside of the conference rooms, but the area was very un-ergonomic, and looked like a front desk. One of the conference-goers"
We are totally impressed with this hotel! The staff welcomed us with their kindness and warmth and made our stay unforgettable! The furnishings are very stylish. The rooftop bar with this unique view is overwhelming! Love it üòç
"We stayed at the W whilst attending a wedding also at the W - on arrival I was really impressed with the hotel, it is something to look at for sure, what a vibe!  The check in experience was very friendly and the staff on the front desk were exceptional.  The food and beverage service through out was good, the breakfast offering was a stand out for sure - the service at the wet bar could be a little more attentive but at least the views are good!  A must mention is that the senior staff of the hotel were always visible and hands on with their teams - this really shows that the hotel has a great culture and it is reflecting brilliantly on the guest experience"
"I last stayed here about a year ago, and it was such a splendid stay, that I gave a 5 star review then. Decided it was due for another visit just to see has the standards been maintained, and I'm delighted to say, it definitely has. Checked into the Marvelous Suite again, so nothing new to experience, except this time was given a room higher up, so the views are better. Everything is as I remembered it be during my first stay, room is awesome, service is awesome, and this time I decided to spent more of my stay here at the Wetdeck. Nothing beats taking a dip in the pool whilst gazing at the magnificent views of the Twin Towers next door. And at night, the Wetdeck is even more awesome! I didn't get to spend any time here at night during my last stay as it was closed due to some"
"The price is definitely worth as friendly staff, good service, clean and modern design in room and hotel. We were staying two days in this hotel, We will come back again! )) The location are great. But I will give breakfast as four stars. But overall everything was great!"
"One of the best hotel that I had stayed so far. Room, staff, service , food, amenities, facilities are excellent. Special thanks to Lambda, Chef Richard, the Malay lady and gentleman that took care of us during breakfast . Thank you for such a wonderful hospitality. Congratulations and well done."
"I have stayed at W Kuala Lumpur a couple of times since the opening in 2018. The hotel still never fails to impress me over the impeccable service, food and the people which the hotel GM Mr Christian has managed very well.  W brand has always been my favourite among the Marriott chain of hotels and this place certainly is one of the best I ever stay and my preferred choice whenever I visit Kuala Lumpur for leisure trip.  It is situated close to the iconic landmark in KL which is the Petronas Tower and the view is amazing from the hotel.   I am in the midst of planning again this February for a celebration with my partner in lieu of Vday over here and I can't wait.   Highly recommended place to stay over in KL and not to be missed! :)"
"We were so excited for the stay since it was quite pricey but we didnt mind due to the location and view. We booked the Spectacular room with twin tower view.  We arrived before 3pm hoping we can check in early, however we were informed the room wasn't ready and we needed to wait for an hour to an hour and half. We were shocked but the reception was very apologitic, and to compensate us for the inconvenience they gave us voucher for free drinks at the woobar while waiting...after an hour, still our room wasnt ready and i think their manager stepped in and told us they will give us temporary room and we agree. The check in process was a bit slow compared to other Marriott hotels. Anyway, the temp room given was corner room and sooo pretty... we started using the amenities and"
"Perfectly situated in the center of KL, across the street from the Petronas Towers, another perfect stay at the W. This was our first stay at this particular property. Very stylish with a modern, artsy, and hip design. The hotel is fairly new; about a year and a half since it‚Äôs opening. It still smells like a brand new car!  The staff was amazing. High complements go to front desk and restaurant staff. They were so helpful and personable. It made our stay better than I could have imagined. We really had the opportunity to get to know some of the hosts and servers and the service at Flock, which is the main restaurant where breakfast is served. We really enjoyed our conversations with the servers. Even though we didn‚Äôt have any personal contact with housekeeping, the service they"
"Amazing views of the Petronas Twin Towers from the rooftop. Great food, lovely staff and room service, excellent bar and pool services. So many great spots in and around the hotel to take pictures. Quality of the room was superb! They helped me reheat a food I had brought in from a restaurant the previous day (at no extra cost!) Overall trip and hotel stay experience was worthwhile (money well spent). Definitely recommend."
Following a disappointing W stay in Singapore this blew us away. Amazing space and breathtaking location. Wet deck was cool to hang out in at night. Staff were super on it and gave great service throughout. We booked a suite which looked out on to the towers. Great recognition as a titanium Marriott member. We will be back soon hopefully.
"This hotel is faultless, its got a really cool vibe which is evident throughout the hotel.  The staff can not do enough for you, nothing is too much trouble.  Need anything just press whatever/whenever on your in room phone.  We ate in Woo Bar- snacks,great quality, quirky cocktails with a menu you can throw a dice on to decide what you want!  Flock- just fabulous!  Wet Deck- we went to a party on the Saturday night, great atmosphere, DJ‚Äôs.  Excellent pool service, good choice of food and drink.  The view from the pool is to die for.  Had breakfast in bed, again was amazing.  It is worth every ringgit, do not hesitate to book!"
"I have good impression in last 2 stays at W KL and decided to come back again which is not disappointed.   As Marriott Ambassador Elite, I have been upgraded to Studio suite which is much bigger than Typical studio room type (if I am not wrong, it is appx 92sqm). Property also offer beyond normal Marriott scheme by giving both complimentary breakfast and 1,000 Bonvoy points which is fantastics.   Similar to last time, I enjoyed all session in the property from Front desk, Fantastic Chinese food @ YEN, Woo Bar as well as Breakfast at Flock. Only one comment which I feel very disappointed not only this time but with previous experience as well is at WET deck.   I knew this is kind of cool bar for people to have good drink with nice KLCC view but staff behavior is something"
Great stay from the start to the end! We arrived at the hotel in the morning before check in time and was given early check in with a upgraded room to the Spectacular room. Room was beautiful which faces the twin towers. There's enough amenities(even face wash!) in the room so if you are travelling light you won't need to worry. Hotel is close to most places we wanted to go to but beware of the peak hours. Breakfast was excellent with a variety of choices. Overall all the staff were attentive and friendly.
"I was there last weekend stay for 2 nights, i always said staying at W Hotels was amazing experience from room decor & music and W KL is awesome talent service with smile always make you feel welcome and Wet is fantastic always happening on wknd."
"Where do I even start?! I am still on a hype of how amazing this hotel is! From pre-arrival to the very few seconds of my stay, I'm completely blown away.   Kristin, W Insider, was in touch with me days before I arrived and made sure I had a smooth transition from the airport to the hotel. And where my jaw dropped was when I entered my spacious, luxurious room and an awesome, personalized amenity was already waiting for me. That truly was the highlight of the trip and will be forever remembered. Thanks, Kristin!  Every staff I encountered was extremely friendly and would even go out of their way to talk to me. I could really sense the W-ness oozing out from each of their talents here.   Breakfast was also another superb experience. Richard, Director of Culinary, was always"
"I wanted to like this hotel, but it doesn't live up to the hype or the cost.  As we say in Texas - ""All Hat, No Cattle"".  From a practical standpoint who needs 16 different switches by the bedside?  Just keep it simple, I am just here for a night or two - do not want to spend that much time learning what turns what on or off.  The lobby lounge had the music much too loud - I ask them to turn it down so we could hear each other talk and they did - but said that they were going for a ""vibe"".  Guess that vibe is to not have a conversation.  The throw pillows on the beds just made me think - ""I wonder whose germs are on those?""  - might look nice - but a big yuck factor to me.  It does have a location within easy walking distance to the Towers, so if you want to go there it is very"
