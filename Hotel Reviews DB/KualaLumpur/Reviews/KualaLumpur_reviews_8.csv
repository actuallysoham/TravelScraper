Hotel staff are very friendly and give warm welcome to guest. The receptions staff helpful and assisting.  Room clean and tidy. Mall just next door and convenient to find food. Pool and gym need to book first
It really pleasant. But the most important thing that makes this such a good place to stay are the staff. All of the people are incredibly helpful and generous especially Mr Kelvin and Ms Karen O_O  Thank youu and take care!
"The staff are friendly and very helpful. Room clean and very comfortable.. The mall just beside the hotel and convenient to find food. Overall everything good stay, definitely will come back with family."
Front Desk need to be more friendly and welcoming the guest. Everything else is okey. Location was superb. Because its located in the middle of the mall. Room is just nice with peaceful design and room color.
"Staff friendly and soft spoken, easy and done fast to check in/out. Room so comfortable, clean and spacious. Easy access to Velocity Mall but no special parking for hotel customer. Take lot of time to search parking."
The room is spacious and clean! The bed are so comfyyyy. Water heater is functioning well. Receptionist are friendly and helpful. Parking is freeeee! Very nice location as the hotel is attached with the mall!
Sunway Velocity Hotel is the best place for your staycation or vacation. The Hotel staff are excellent and helpful. Love the room and pool. Shopping is just next door. So convenient and within KL city.
My second trip here. I love the location - easy for me to access my needs. The staffs were polite n helpful. Wish though the fifth level to the mall is accessible again especially for the senior citizen like me
"i decided to check in at Sunway velocity hotel because my daughter want to spend time more at swimming. unfortunately, we need to book slot first and duration was only for 1 hour. i think like i pay for nothing to get that service. you should make it longer time spent for swimming. poor my daughter."
"No idea to travel during pandemic, hence we've decided to have weekend getaway at Sunway Velocity Hotel. Surprisingly, it's a prefect staycation. Nearby Sunway Velocitu Mall, friendly staff, clean, comfy and complete facilities including swimming pool and gym."
身为ex hotelier的我来comment最适合不过了哈哈。 1. 酒店很新 2. 房间很干净 3. 重点是服务超级棒。我觉得那里的员工都很well trained，他们的服务态度很好做起事情来很efficient。我可以感觉到他们都很用心来对待hotel guest 4. 泳池很漂亮 5. 时间观念很好 送餐很准时完全没有delayed 6. Front office接电话的速度很快。我们打了好几次都是嘟一声就接了。 7. Special thanks to reservation team (Karen) for the connecting room，Front office team （sorry I cannot remember his name who help me during check in) staff at swimming pool area （morning and night shift。Thank you for the excellent service。
This this my second time I stay with this hotel. I booked direct to the hotel website...for the next trip I want to try the big room...family's room.   A bit scary at night because I fell only me and my sons stay at that floor.
"It was a good experience staying in SUNWAY Velocity Hotel.  Friendly and warm service from all their staff - housekeeping, front office and security staff.    Comfortable room and convenient location with a mall and medical Centre next door.  Will return for next stay and recommend to friends and family."
"Basically the staff service is great. But the room cleanness, water pressure, and Wifi speed can be improved. It is inconvenience to access to the Sunway Velocity Mall for having meals and shopping. Thank You!"
The staffs provide Good service. The hotel has a Perfect location and its easy to access to the mall. The gym is well maintained. The hotel also follow strict SOP and ensure the facilities timely sanitized
Amazing! The hotel was accesible to the mall and MRT. It was such a last minute booking but we were catered. We wished that our room would be accesible from car parking but we had to go to G floor each time and I found it so inconvenient. We didn’t have enough mineral water for the day.
"Several time checkin Velocity Hotel. Good service like before and convinient attached with the mall. But swimming pool and gym still close due to CMCO. Temperature checking everytime come back to the hotel, very safe."
"The hotel is clean and very near to the mall. The staff are  very friendly and helpful.)Overall experience was awesome.I'll recommend this hotel to every couple and families:). You wont regret,just be there:)"
"Been here few times. so far its the best hotel, near to shopping mall, very clean with friendly staff. The room is spacious, and comfortable. Overall, it is a great hotel, would definitely stay here again."
Absolutely outstanding hotel perfectly located. The staff were very approachable and extremely helpful who go above and beyond to make sure you have the best time. I would highly recommend this hotel!
1st time stay in this hotel after my regular hotel closed. staff very helpful. The filipino manager ramatesh very kind and helpful when i lock myself in the room. Anas help me to sanitize the room very appreciate. i hope when i return i will see all the staff again.  the room was big and comfortable.  Very near to mall. Luckly i found a good hotel to stay.
"Stay one (1) night in the quieter part of KL. However an LRT station is located in a shopping which adjourning to the Hotel.   Because of the MCO all facilities were unavailable. What we have were attentive, pleasant and friendly staff. The room was clean and we like the many  attentive details available in the room. Wheelchair bound guest will be pleased that the overall hotel and its surrounding areas are user friendly."
"i came during first mco, that time the hotel is still operating, i was a bit scared to check in, but i can see that the hotel really follow the procedure to adept in MCO. and the hotel itself to the mall, so i went shopping and the shops is really interesting. Anyhow, i will return back when i visit KL, thanks Sunway for giving a good service during this MCO period."
The sfaff are very helpful and friendly in helping me . the hotel near to mall and very easy to excess but sadly the pool and gyn not open due to MCO . but however still satisfied with the service. will come again with my family after this pandemic. and hope the pool gonna open
"The room was great but the aircond was so poor. I even called the receptionist regarding the aircond and the maintenance came yet still the aircond was not cold. So disappointed on that. Other than that, ok la"
"Very welcoming with friendly staff.. comfortable room.. easy access to the mall.. will definitely stay here again.   Only setback is the lack of a breakfast buffet and also room service... was not much of trouble though,  as the mall is easily accessible ."
Hopefully hotel management can improve with separate the smoker room and not to give it to non smoker guest. If hotel management can not promise my request I will not going to stay this hotel again in future.
The hotel is taken all measures of safety on covid-19. Room is nice and clean. The hotel also quite new. Next to Sunway Velocity shopping mall which is very convenient to have foods and shopping. The only issue is all hotel facilities was closed. No fun for the kids.
"The location, cleanliness, and staff are very good. Fast check-in and check out. Friendly staff. For those like convenience distance to Hotel & Mall. This is the best choices when travel to Ampang/Cheras/Bangi/Serdang.Easy access to the mall, food, movies and etc."
Staff friendly and helpful especially Praba and Tevan. Hotel near to mall and convenient to public transport. Room clean and tidy. There is Starbucks counter at lobby and the ice cream potong is fantastic.
"I love the room very very much, stayed in room 1334, room is super comfy and the most important is the services they provided! Was excellent ! Connected to a well appointed mall, Super Convenient ! easy get food however mall close early due to CMCO, but it is understandable. I will definitely come back again ! thanks Mr Kelvin who help to arrange the room. It is amazing they brew starbuck at the lobby."
"Hotel attached with mall, and get free parking via coupon. staff all friendly, they will run to scan u up at lobby everytime u enter the area, I was checked in by Rash and Nas i think the name. overall nice, will come again after pkpb"
Clean and comfortable.  Good service  and good management. And also  have a car parking. Near shopping complex. Easy and convenient.  Affordable price.  There also have a sofa bed.  Nice view and nice environment.
"Came down here for a three night stay (had to leave a day early due to Emergency Covid Lockdown in KL) Hotel is right above shops and restaurants in Velocity shopping complex.  Covered walkways to MyTown and Maluri shopping centres make this a great location for a shopping and eating get away trip.  Hotel is very modern, clean and practical and staff are very helpful.  Only minor problem is finding the parking area closest to hotel as signs are not good (You need to get to Yellow zone and you will see a hotel lobby elevator).  Also MRT at Cochrane near by for quick access to Bukit Bintang and Chinatown."
"The staff very friendly,  Environment very comfortable and facilities in side the room is up to my expectations.. the most important is the toilet is clean  .. worth for $$$  Definitely will repeat again"
"My one night stay here with my family has been great.  I brought my 65 year old mother and a new-born baby to stay with me. The hotel staffs has been very helpful especially Mr. Teven at the Receptionist and Mr. Mohd Ikhwan Azis for his help in making my family/other guests stay here comfortable and technically safe. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, I realized that Sunway Velocity Hotel plays a great role in making the hotel Sustainable and an Age-Friendly Hotel.  It’s accesible, equitable, inclusive, safe and secure and as well as supportive to various range of demographics, backgrounds, and ability.  I will definitely come back here again and recommend my famy and friends to stay here in the future!"
The hotel is cosy with friendly staff and comfortable room. it is a preferred hotel for you to stay when you are in KL. We love to stay at this hotel. Overall it was a excellent and pleasant stay. Thanks to hotel staff.
i find it nice place to stay. clean room and big swimming pool. not so fond of the shopping mall though as not much choices of halal food there. but it is a good hotel to stay when u're in kl. ~~~~~~~~~~~~@@@@@@@
"Valuable with good facilities provided for a night of comfy stay. The environment is nice, clean, with good lighting for photography. Overall, it is recommended for stay with couple, friends and family."
"A great place for shopping lovers. Street Street food stalls are accessible by walking. Taman Pudu Ulu park is not far from the hotel, can go by Grab. You can spend times for workout in morning or evening."
The Hotel is located next to a shopping mall where you could find almost anything and everything. There are so many food and beverage outlet option in the mall. There is even a medical centre within a walking distance. Staff are friendly and the rooms are clean. There is also a fitness centre and a swimming pool.
"Good view, good receptionist service. Just  my son found toys under the bed means its not thoroughly clean. But im totally satisfied with the stay. Near to MRT. Easy to find foods at the mall. Overall Good For Money"
it's a comfortable location as it's well facilitated. happens that I didn't need to be fussy with my location this trip. food at the nearby location was quite suitable for me as I had a meeting that night with an ex business associate.
"The hotel stay was very pleasant and comfortable. The staff was very polite and helpful, the location was very convenient for getting around. The room was very clean, comfortable bed and excellent wifi speed. Will highly recommend this hotel to others.   Thanks."
"Pleasant stay at the hotel. Check in on saturday, the hotel is very busy! Have to que to check in. Nice pool but have to reserve because of current covid situation. Clean room. Good job to the housekeepers. Got a warm welcome from MsSiti. Very helpful and friendly receptionists. Parking is bad because full of mall shoppers but special thanks to Ms Masad for helping us find our car in the heat of the basement. Overall good stay! Will try the stay on less busy days."
"I love everything about this hotel. Located just near the fort in perfect location,the hotel is clean and provides a great hospitality.The rooftop swimming pool of hotel was great. Overall experience was awesome.I'll recommend this hotel."
"Thank you to Mr Charlie Front Office Manager for his excellent service, from reception to Housekeeping staff all are very friendly & helpfull, Great Hotel & Great Location, this my 2nd visit and looking forward for my 3rd visit. Really loves this hotel, everything was perfect..."
"I chose this hotel because i really just wanted a short weekend stay and convenient to grab food etc. Not needing to go in and out from the lobby just to go to the mall, is a plus! I just wanted to spend time with my friend catching up on each other's lives. I made an arrangement to decorate my room for a birthday surprise for my best friend (i was kinda anxious thinking of any possible outcomes) and i am glad everything went well. Thank you for your warm and pleasant hospitality."
"The Deluxe King Room was spacious and clean but the bath towels were not very clean (still smell). The Laundry Service was slow to respond despite checking a number of times. Other than these 2 small issues, the hotel room and overall service was good."
I entered the parking entrance A without knowing that would be the easiest way to get to the hotel lobby. Lots of parking space available. Frontdesk staff was friendly and helpful. Love the room. Love love the Smart TV. More love to the bidet in the toilet. 2 minutes walking into the mall. 5 minutes drive to IKEA! I Definitely coming back!! Stayed for 3 nights. Well worth the money.
"Everything about the place, room, reception, is great. One slight probably major flaw, is the elevator, only 2 elevator for rooms which caused a very very very long wait. 2 elevator for parking is pretty redundant. Make it 3 for room level and 1 dedicated for parking"
Overall it was a pleasant experience. Thanks to the entire team ensuring our comfortness and enjoyment. The place is clean and security is very tight where they provide acess card for every guest. I will give 5 star.
Hope your hotel can change the brand new mattress and the pillows . The toilet tile very dirty . Better to improve . Aircond cannot be adjusted  . The rest is ok . Will stay next trip due to your strategic location .
"Great location, really pleasant and clean rooms, but the thing that makes this such a good place to stay are the convenience of link to shopping mall. One of the nicest places i stayed in KL. Room very clean and tidy with comfortable bed."
The rate is affordable with all the facilities given. I had a pleasant stay at Sunway Velocity Hotel with my husband.  You can shop and also rest or sleep there.  Its really convenient. The staff also very great and helpful.  Will look forward to stay here again
"The room is very clean. The hotel also has a very good view to the KL City, especially viewing from the swimming pool. The staff that working in the hotel also very friendly. The hotel is connecting to Mall and quite convenience and they are varieties of food stall or restaurant."
"located just beside of Sunway Velocity Mall and 5mins walk from LRT Maluri and MRT station too. Easy to go around KL if you do not drive here. Room is new and modern but the room size is not big. Room is majority green color and look fresh. The standing shower area is with metal bar and a sitting place, so it is very useful for old people and it is disabled friendly too. There is a link/an entrance to the Mall at 5th floor. So, you can easily go to the Mall without using the main/side entrance from outside. The Mall is happening therefore no problem for food and shopping."
"No designated parking for hotel guests! Very troublesome to hotel guests. Only 2 lifts are working going up into hotel rooms from the lobby. According to the X marks inside the lift where everyone is told to practice social distancing, you just have to wait for the next lift!"
"All Staff is helpful and friendly.  Room is comfortable and sofa bed is ready before check in. Hotel is very clean and swimming pool is awesome. No space for hungry, a lot of restaurants inside Velocity Mall."
"The room was clean and comfortable, with basic, quality amenities provided. As the stay was during the Covid-19 RMCO period, our bags were sanitized before entering the hotel lobby. The room was booked under the Shop and Stay promotion, hence the price and package was worthy (with meal and shopping vouchers). Definitely return if happens to come to KL again, as the location is ideal (walking distance to MRT station, and the hotel just located beside the Sunway Velocity Mall)."
"Ive called sunway velocity before and while my stay, the receptionist were very bad. Speaking to customer like speaking to enemy. I really feel so bad! Especially the night duty receptionist on 11.00pm 23/8/2020. She just hung up my phone call before i finish my inquiry."
A short trip with Family with good overall experience with friendly staff !   Room is spacious and clean with adjustable air con temperature.   Would recommend others as is convenient to access to nearby mall and facilities !
"The hotel beside mall, carpark is free so its easy for us to deal with shopping in this hotel. If u plan to have a shopping trip, i would prefer u this hotel because the price also not that expensive and they have offer now. Just ask with reception for the best price to offer Even agoda cannot beat their offer."
- the room is big and clean and cozy - the bathroom is big and clean - the hotel environment feel relax and peaceful  Overall the hotel is worth to stay and will recommend to friends and family.  We will come again.
"All the staff very friendly feel like home. Super convenient get shop in just minute. Sanitized around entire property and tighten of security to ensure every visitor to the property with clear identity provided. Keep it up, i strongly recommend those who trip to KL and please get it try for this Sunway Velocity Hotel as well."
"Spacious & Clean Room Brighter of room lighting & Smart TV with many Channel available. Super convenient get shop in just minute. Sanitized around entired property and tighten of security to ensure every visitor to the property with clear indentity provided. Keep it up, i strongly recommend those who trip to KL and pls get it try for this hotel sunway velority as well."
Friendly staff. Room clean. Given us to early c/in room. Any special request and assistant without any charges. High recommended. Public transport very convinience to connect tourist and famous places.
"I really love the warm hospitality, the coziness of the room and the cleanliness of the room. The location is strategic too, as you can access directly to Sunway Velocity Mall and public transportation, Grab/Taxi/Bus and MRT via Taman Maluri Station"
"We had spent very nice, memorable weekend staying at Sunway Velocity Hotel. The room is so spacious, cosy and comfortable. Situated in the shopping mall Sunway Velocity mall made our weekend more enjoyable as there are so many interesting things you can do inside this shopping mall, from shopping with good discount to having variety of dishes , Thai food, Japanese food, western food, or authentic Malay recipes all there."
i enjoyed with my stay. lovely hotel and very comfortable. 2-4 mins walk to Sunway Velocity Mall. Breakfast was really good. Also staff (Fahmi Jasan) also very helpful . Would definitely stay again . Thank you !
"i was having a weekend getaway with my girlfriend for the weekend.   The hotel and facilities is all great , the hotel conducted a good SOP for guests during the check in !   I was attended efficiently by Frontdesk officer (Teven) , he is very helpful arranging the best view room for our stay !    We had great talk with the manager (Raymond Thean) , he is a friendly and attentive even arranged car park during our stay !   Overall, the room is very clean , well sanitized (whole building), and feel safe to stay here.   Definitely will return for next trip !!! Value for money !!!"
"good stay. need to improve parking ticket like sunway putra, didn't need voucher. just get to receptionist for validation. other issues that some idiot people laugh and talking loud like drunk at corridor. so disturbing."
Enjoy staying at Sunway Velocity Hotel. This is a staycation for my family. The room amenities is great. My family and I spent a good time here. Enjoy shopping and dining in the mall. Overall is great.
"Staff are very good, professional service despite have to attend to many guests. They claim to have high speed WiFi - which is true, during my two weeks stay. Thank you so much for SVKL staff for the service during my stay."
"Spent a fortnight here as the mandatory quarantine purpose. The room was nice and clean. The ambience was calm and the staffs were very helpful and friendly throughout my stay there. Location is very excellent (although I stayed inside all day long); near to MyTown, IKEA, Sunway Velocity Mall & MRT Station. Probably will consider to stay here once again to explore their other amenities. Thank you SV!"
"I am lucky to be quarantine in Sunway Velocity Hotel for 14 days! The best hospitality servicing in Cheras! They provide clean and freshness room.  I would like to show infinite thank to the KKM, APM, the frontliner and also the staffs in Sunway Velocity Hotel who always taking care of us by providing the delicious food and beverage!"
Got assigned to this hotel for my mandatory quarantine. The hotel staff were nice and helpful. They helped us in every way they could and it's definitely a good visit! Would stay here again in the near future if possible.
"Stayed here during quarantine, and the staff were exceptional in making our stay as comfortable and safe as they could. Rooms were very comfortable, and staying in the room for two weeks straight was no problem at all."
1. Room is     a) nice    b) clean    c) no funny and smoke smell    d) bed and pillows are solid and comfortable    e) TV - good size and a smart tv  2. Staff    a) extremely friendly    b) prompt in response    c) helpful    d) professional    e) efficient  Thumbs up.   Please keep up the good work..
"This hotel located right next to the Sunway shopping mall. The staff, they speak english and they are so nice and friendly, they help you for everything. The room is very comfortable,spacious with everything you need in the inside, the decoration is simple and nice. If you come to Kuala Lumpur, this is the place to stay."
"The hotel is strategically located for travelers who wish to explore KL without wasting too much time stuck in traffic jams and the fumes in the heart of the city. Its a 5mins drive to the Permaisuri Lake garden for morning jogs and a University Hospital (in case of any emergency). The hotel is very well maintain in terms of appearance, hygiene and cleanliness. The hotel is attached to a shopping center Sunway Velocity Mall which gives travelers convenient access to a supermarket, a variety of restaurants, gym, movie theatres, a clinic, besides clothes and other household items. It has a good secure covered car parks.  The room is excellent in all aspects especially hygiene and cleanliness, has a good wifi connectivity, and excellent view of the kl city skyline. It has a good"
"I'm check in on 29 February until 2 March with my friend. Room is clean and nice, staff are friendly and helpful when check in. The buffet breakfast not much choices but the food is nice. Everything was great, very comfortable beds and lovely pool view."
"It was such a great experience in April 2019 that I brought my family here again on Mar 2020. My parents enjoyed staying here too. Front desk staff were very attentive to customers. They saw my dad with a fresh injury and quickly helped to bandage the wound. He did not fall in hotel facilities, it was during one activity before we reached hotel. Frontdesk staff were quick to contact us when they saw my dad wuth injured leg. We were intending to buy first aid kits after putting down our bags but my dad went roam hotel on his own. Pleasantly surprised that he had been immediately attended to. Bed and linens were very nicely pressed and we had a good rest during our stay. Location is good and we really have no complaints to this hotels. I have stayed no less than 30 hotels"
This is a great hotel and conveniently located an easy walk up from the hotel to the mall. The kids loved the swimming pool area. The staff were very approachable and helpful. The breakfast was good. I will recommend to others family member to stay here.
Great stay for me and my family. Location is superb as it is next to the mall. Plenty of food choices in the mall and shopping. Parking is free.  A couple of things need to improve. 1. Internet is slow. 2. Deposit needs to be returned immediately with a void credit card slip. 3. The sofa bed has stain on it.
"Great value for money. Good customer service, welcoming at the desk on arrival.  When we arrived there was a lot of hair around the room on the bed and floors but they immediately came and cleaned it.     The Rooftop pool is worth every penny of your stay, its open until quite late so you can enjoy the spectacular city lights view from the warm pool. There are tables up there too, so we also took our dinner up there which was a lovely experience."
Stayed here 4 nights for business. The room is clean. The wi-fi is fine. The breakfast selection is OK nothing fantastic. The staff are pleasant and helpful. It is connected to the Sunway Velocity Mall which is fine but the shops are not as great as the bigger shopping complexes like MidValley.
Hotel is clean and convenient for me. Beside Sunway Velocity Mall with range of food and shops for your choice of selection. Basically you can get anything you want and price is reasonable. Will come again..
"Told the hotel it’s our anniversary trip, and the room was nicely decorated with fresh rose petals on the bed and in the toilet. With towel folded swans. Location is great, within walking distance to mrt and departmental store. Service was good too. The only thing is they didn’t come with body lotion, probably need to request for it."
"Were disappointed when I book a 2 person room but only given 1 breakfast voucher. When i asked the receptionist, they say because i only put 1 adult in booking. This can be change at your side when we checked in but the receptionist asked us to pay for breakfast instead. Such a shame. The housekeeping is really slow too. Had to call twice to get them to fix the remote control. Disappointing for a well known name."
"Room not fully maintenance. 4 unit Lighting bulb not function, but only 1 replace new bulb. Also kettle broke & not function. Informed to receptionist & room service start 3pm until 12am but still not response. Terrible room service from Sunway Velocity Hotel."
"nice hotel with great deco, great location that linked to shopping mall and restaurant, nice staff with polite greeting, free parking provided and suitable for family. will definitely recommend to others."
"Just a suggestion for the Car Park. Hope the Hotel will consider to have a designated car park space for Hotel guest. We have to fight with the shoppers and it is quite frustration during the peak season. Other than that, the room is value for money."
"Hotel room was clean Customer service are polite Can't find parking space can park Recommended to join with Lady parking,  there is a fence around Not fair for us to rent your hotel Pls pay attention to above car park issue."
The hotel bedroom is very big & spacious! And the bathroom is separated from the toilet. Have 2 big washing basin! The bed is very comfortable. Great stay for 3 people! And the shopping centre is next to the hotel. Is very convenience. Will recommend friends and family to this hotel.
"Very good value for money, connection to shopping mall is big advantage and transportation to other places is easy. Hotel is very clean and organize shuttle bus to city center, good gym and pool, staff are polite and helpful"
"The Carpet, Bedsheets n toilet shower area arent clean after the last check out. Requested to change the sheets on the 2nd day of my stay only then it was better. Requested extra towel for my toddler but everysday thrs shortage of towels.. Sometimes only 1 towel in the toilet."
"We reached the hotel early morning and wanted to find somewhere to freshen up. The hotel staff at the front office was very helpful and knowledgeable, providing information and bring us around the amenities. Special thanks to their Front Office Manager - Mr. Lim Soon Tiong for his staff and his help in helping us arrange the necessary to ensure everything was according to our travel plan and making it a wonderful stay. The hotel has a beautiful infinity pool and is also well located near the Maluri train station easily accessible to many nice locations in KL such as the KLCC for the twin towers or the Chinatown area. I would recommend this hotel!"
