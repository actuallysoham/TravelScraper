"It was heartwarming to be greeted by familiar friendly faces, after the global pandemic. Harvin, Jim and Priya were, as usual, their professional and enthusiastic selves ever ready to ensure our stay is comfortable and safe. They each took the time to welcome us back.   The trainees this round were personable too; speaking good English with care and attention to our needs and sharing their hospitality journey when prompted.   We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better team at the Executive Lounge. Thank you to Harvin, Jim, Priya and all the best to Seran, Pravind, Andrew, Kejeh, Ifrah!   Best,  Angela and Sharon"
"Great stay here, enjoyed the time spent and absolute pleasure of service level offered. Well deserved hotel to stay if you are in within KL area.    Note:- Great thanks to Pravind, Seram, Andrew, Priya, Jim, Kejen, Ifrah for making my stay so memorable here."
"Me and my family stayed at Hilton Kuala Lumpur to celebrate my mom‚Äôs birthday. Started from the booking part via Hilton mobile apps , the apps is very helpful and convenient to track record my points and benefits. The chat messenger is very convenient, fast and smooth especially during this pandemic to have a less physical contact.  Checking in was fast and easy, the front desk agent Mr Ryan was so warm and friendly, really showing the high quality standard of service of Hilton. The agent did sent me and family to the elevator and offered the room orientation but i promptly decline the offer. I wish i can mention their name especially from the bell service one by one to give them credits on how they assisted us in the best possible way to make our stay enjoyable.   The room was"
"Hotel practices good safety protocols with lots of hand sanitizer available in common areas and reminders to socially distance.  Stayed for a one-nighter on a weekday (12-13 April). Occupancy was low so it was less hectic as compared to my previous stays (on weekends).  Due to status, got upgraded to a decent room which was spacious and comfortable with a view of the lake (as opposed to the city view which is also quite good if you are into that sort of thing).  In general, service was good all round and in particular exceptional at the Exec Lounge - which has at last been opened! Please extend my thanks to the team who have really made the effort to make me feel comfortable. I also had a very interesting conversation with one of the Exec Lounge staff (Mr. Seran) on the evening"
Awesome stay with a very warm hospitality. The room was spacious with a trendy jacuzzi bath tub thats add up the excitement of the stay. The swimming pool was huge and fun with cool water slides. Will surely comeback for another visit in the future...
"Glad that the Executive Lounge has finally opened to guests after so long; though the food/canap√©s was a scaled down version, but the drink serve is as good as before. The breakfast at Vasco is an assisted buffet and it's a reduced version due to MCO. Praveen, the trainee I met in the Exe Lounge is a great guy!"
We had our office ramadhan dinner tonight. Attended by a friendly and attentive personnel Encik Annuar üëçüèªüëçüèªüåü Thank you for the lovely hospitality  We enjoyed our meals very much. There is variety of food that can be choosed and the taste are also good! Thank you for a great dining experience. Keep it up
"Luxury and cozy place, easy reservation from website, variety of great food, friendly staff and warm greet from Mr Anuar. Will recommend to our friends and work colleagues. Recommended place for Ramadan buffet."
I love to stay here at Hilton KL. The room very nice and facilities was awasome . About food also very tip top & many choice of food. We love to stay hilton & for sure come back again Hilton. Staff very helpful & friendly especially Mr.Annuar. Worth it to stay and should try atleast once in life !
"Overall experience was superb. A surprise birthday deco in my room 2707 & 2706 really has make a memorable birthday gifts. Thanks to Ikhwan, Akmal & the team. We had a wonderful stay at Hilton KL üëçüëçüëèüëè"
"Special appreciation and credits goes to Mr. Gagan Talwar (Hotel Manager), Mr. Rizki Triananda (Front Office Manager) and the whole team of Hilton KL who always makes our stays so great, awesome and cheerful. My score to Hilton KL is perfect 10/10 for the QUALITY of the service, hospitality and foods served despite limited/reduced services due to Covid-19 pandemic. Standard operating procedures are in place with effective monitoring and observation all the time. Right from the check-in to room amenities to safety measures are being gauged accurately and room well-equipped to accommodate the changing travelers‚Äô expectations with CLEANSTAY stickers in the room. Very helpful and friendly staff who go beyond the service requirement to make sure guests have the best time despite"
"This is my first time write a review after couple of times staying at Hilton KL. Firstly, fantastic Hilton hospitality during check in and check out. The process were smooth, superb and excellent. Even though there were many people during weekend, the process was fast and the front desk keep smiling and acting professionally. Thumb up to the Front Desk Team.   Special thanks to Mr Ronald ( sorry, correct me if i'm wrong) who assist and detailed the hotel info briefly.  Suprizingly he has a great memory and even remember my name and it maybe justify how frequent i'm staying here. Kudos to him personally. Last but no least, late checkout extended was awesome, lovely.   The room with open bathtub concept is the one of my best point to keep loyal with Hilton KL. It is totally"
"Stayed here for one night as a staycation. With two young kids we were looking for a relaxing change of scenery after being home for so long. Unfortunately a very disappointing stay. Check in was very weird and unprofessional. Check in was 3pm we showed up a but early (our bad) and where told to wait in the lobby and they would let us know when the room was ready. At 3pm still nothing and when asking they said that the room was not ready and they also couldn‚Äôt tell us how long it would take. Unacceptable if you‚Äôre only there for one night and don‚Äôt get access to the facilities until you have your room key. Only after making quite a fuss we got to get the room. Another weird thing is that we booked the grand executive suite, and online while booking it said you had access to the"
"Good n friendly staff. Level 33 staff are helpful and happy to be here. However, dinner at Vasco was really terrible with no food replenished , poor service , would say eating at hawker will be better than at Vasco . Check out time only 4 lifts working. Waited 30 mins for a lift.   Staff at 33 rd floor who are helpful b friendly. Seram, Andrew, Jim, Oriya, Pravind n mishalyn"
"Had great time during short stay recently. It was plenty of guests during the stay. Which caused little bit more of waiting time at some occasions.  Team at the lounge did a good job to make the waiting time feels shorter. Thanks to Seran, Fravind, Andrew, Jim, Priya & Mishalyn.. Not to forget Rayan from Housekeeping.."
"The hotel located in the city center and lots of public transport, nearby restaurants, etc The hotel staff are nice and friendly. The room very comfortable, great service was served at executive lounge  by Seran, Pravind, Priya, Danish and Raf. A bonus point for great, friendly and welcoming team from Vasco too. Such a good energy that given by Azu, Aizat, Syuhada and Shameer. Had a hiccups at the front desk, check in process always, always very slow. Overall, good stay!"
"I was so pleased with the warm hospitality given to us by Pravind, seran, priya, raf and danish. As a guest at Hilton and with their great hospitality at efl, i will definitely come back to the hotel."
"Thank you Seran, Pravind, Priya, Danish and Raf! You guys did a good job. I had my good time here with my lovely gf at the lounge. Thank you for the hot chocolate! üòç  We are regular here. I just love to stay here, I felt calm and peaceful. Also the breakfast is good!"
"Front Desk: Special thanks to Mr Shahril who assist on the check-in & check-out and detailed hotel info was briefed. Late checkout extended by the team member too.   Room: Spacious, contemporary design and nice view. Wide range of channels for the TV too. There are some missing amenities such as pen & paper note, slippers and only 1 bathrobe. However, not important as I not really need it.   Bathroom with bathtub is my favourite part, where you can actually watch the TV while enjoying your soak due to the open concept design of the bathroom. No worries if you need some privacy as there are doors to close off the bathroom too.   Pool: Crowded pool due to high demand which is understandable. However, the limitation of the number of pax in the pool is not consistent. The guests are"
"This is perhaps my 10th stay at Hilton KL. My first time writing a review. Great experience and professional staffs every time despite long queues during check in. I was asked to sit at the lounge(welcome drink was served to me too). Although there were many people checking in, the process was fast. Thanks Omar (hopefully i get your name right) for the room upgrade and your warm welcome. Will definitely come back."
The current Covid 19 SOP was rigorously adhered to throughout the hotel. However poor response from the magic button in room telephone. Could have direct dial to all in house restaurants for dining reservations
"Even though the breakfast quality and variety has been degraded.   Glad that great staffs are still here like Rizki, Priya, Jim, the aunty at cocktail hours & concierge team.  Competition is tougher now hopefully you guys maintain the greatness."
Made last minute booking for one night staycation. Arrive around 130PM and checking in was fast. They got the room ready. Thank you for the lake view upgrade.  Got the room on level 22. Room layout was OK and all seems working fine. The free WIFI is OK. Limited TV channel. Good bath layout too; separate shower and tub. Love the closet design which can be access from both sides. Very practical.  Free form pool on level 8 was great. Trees makes it more tropical nature feeling. There is a slide and small waterfall. Cool to just relax here by the pool.  Breakfast on the main coffee house is just average. Staff on duty were bit warm and cold: unlike other property in PJ. Limited breakfast option. Food tasted just average. I feel that menu and food taste need further improvement.
"It was an amazing experience! The customer service is excellent, check in and check out process we're smooth and fast. The staff are are helpful. Special thanks to front desk ms priya. The lake side view room was nice and clean. We had a wonderful breakfast at Vasco. Great service from chef kumar, mani, fatiha, wai lun, azu, zila, pay yee. Special mention chef Thinesh for the delicious vegetarian pakoda.  Overall it was a great stay, wil definitely be back the next round."
"Been a while since we stayed in this h√¥tel and was super excited to stay here for a 'Gourmet Staycation'.  One of the highlight was that we can choose to have dinner in Vasco's.  What a major disappointment.  Yes, we understand that there's no buffet, however, the ala carte menu is simply disappointing. It was not worth the extra we paid. And the taste, it could be better for this h√¥tel. I could not even finish my pasta. It was that bad. Ordered a hot chocolat√©, tasted like the instant version. Left a bad taste in my mouth.  I am not so sure what's with this package. Ever since we checked-in, this h√¥tel wanted to charge us extra. Lucky for us, we have our booking confirmation in hand, else they wanted to charge us higher. Also, in the restaurant, know your right that you can"
"Thank you arranging such wonderful room decoration for my 6th year anniversary celebration, service beyond the expectations and good service , had dinner at the Ikuteru, food was nice and service was so good , beside that you would like to compliments Azura service , she‚Äôs was so attentive and friendly, was helpful as well during our dinner, kudos ! And Just the  breakfast  at vasco can be improve and be more better from the service perspective, other than that all was so good."
"Absolutely outstanding hotel perfectly located. Helpful, friendly staff who go above and beyond to make sure you have the best time. It was my wedding day during our stay. It was a lovely arrangement by Mr Ikhwan, Ms Baity, Fatihah, Vickness, chef Kazi and Ryan! Also an excellent breakfast and lunch. We will definitely come back with family and I would highly recommend this hotel."
Currently happening right now since I am NOT ABLE to checkin due to long queue since I arrived 3.44pm at Hilton Hotel. The checkin process is worstly slow and it‚Äôs already 5.10pm and I am still waiting my turn to checkin in the hotel. I could not believe this kind of situation could happen with many history of other hotel reservations either for business trip or leisure. The longest time I waited was only 30minutes. Now it‚Äôs almost 2hours of waiting time to checkin. Ridiculous and rubbish service.
"Booked 2 rooms, one suite and one executive rooms. We talked to the sales agent and told them we wanted an early check in at 1.30pm, but it‚Äôs 5.30pm now and our room is still not ready.   Took us 1.5 hours to check in, and once we reached the check in counter, they told us our suite is not ready~ they told us to wait for 30-45 mins.   After 1.5 hours mins, we have been trying to follow up on that, and they have been avoiding our calls. After 10 calls, finally got hold of them and they told us The room is still not ready. (It‚Äôs 5 +pm now)  We have been waiting for 4 hours already :( however their replies is still the same our room is still not ready.   We planned to celebrate my brother‚Äôs birthday and have dinner plans, however all our plans have been ruined.  Pls upgrade your"
"I booked a Hilton Plus Room using the stay and dine package that guarantees a room upgrade. Was told at check in that my room was upgraded.  When we walked in, got the same room with no upgrade and with a bad view.  Rooms wise, it's not bad. In need of an update and maintenance. But generally is was alright."
"It was a great staycation at Hilton KL during last valentine's day. My girlfriend and I enjoyed staying in the spacious clean room that equipped with a nice bathtub. Due to Movement Control Order (MCO), most of hotel facilities are closed and breakfast is served in-room(pre-selected meal upon check-in and up to guest's time preference). Overall it was a great experience despite limited access to hotel facilities and few hiccup. Unfortunately, I'm dissapointed with the hotel's hospitality. I have enquiry on handphone charging cable from the reception and the staff on duty that night failed to get back to me. Besides,  breakfast is served late (not as our pre-booked serving time) and only when we called and ask for it, not to mention the incomplete cutlery inside the pre-pack"
"I stayed here for 2 nights last September for a change of scenery. They stayed true to their commitment to make it safe and clean for their customers especially at this time of the pandemic. They also changed their protocol with their breakfast buffet, by providing you a schedule where you can have your breakfast, this way they would prevent overcrowding of guests in the buffet area.  Overall, it was a great short stay at Hilton, will definitely go again hopefully when the conditions are better."
"KL Hilton has been my favourite staycation venue in Kuala Lumpur. Recently, me and my family booked a couple of rooms for a weekend get away. The rooms have been allocated nicely to our convenience. Due to CMCO,  we couldn't experience our breakfast and evening cocktail in the Executive Lounge. Both were served at the alternative restaurant and lounge bar.  The breakfast experience was alright. However, the evening cocktail services and food varieties can be improved especially at this alternative venue. Also, it is best to have a Hilton Honors counter for the convenience of the members. Overall, through my previous experiences staying in KL Hilton before, I am happy with the services and facilities there.  My special thanks to Mr Ikhwan  Shah, Rooms Division Manager for"
Stayed here during the pandemic and I couldn‚Äôt fault anything even their policy and procedures it in place. The room was above expectations. Food was delicious and the customer service was brilliant. Will come back again
Stayed here for 3 nights in Jan 2021. Nothing to complain about. Good location and good service.   They respond promptly to emails and managed to arrange for airport transfer easily.   But they dont help to pass grab food to the room.
"Kids Friendly Hotel, Very Clean and neat Hotel.  I love to stay here because i've the best experience staying in this hotel..love the service, very fast and special thanks to all the staff, front office, managers, supervisor are all very friendly!! I also experience the best facial at their spa!! Not forgetting their best chefs for the delicious food serve in Vasco's and Chynna Restaurant!! Thank you once again..i would definately come again to Hilton KL!!"
"Great time at The Hilton. Aviary Bar is great. Thank you. Hope to be back some day. Lots of love. Goodbye. Terima kasih. Bye Bye. Selamat Tinggal. Jumpa Lagi. HNY 2021. Would recommend, for, staycations, or, weekend getaways."
"Deciding on Hilton KL for a short staycation was definitely the best choice! We had an amazing stay here!   Nice decent room with exquisite facilities. Comfy bed and stunning lakeview from the room! The bathroom was spacious with bathtub and separate shower.  Buffet breakfast was good even though it has less choice due to the SOP of RMCO.   What impressed me was their excellent customer service. They attended to all my request, very prompt and items were delivered to the room as soon as they arrange it for you. Kudos to the superb customer service!   Furthermore, the hotel is very well maintained and clean! Having said that, you can see every effort was made to ensure that cleanliness and hygiene was maintained.   Will definitely return again!"
"Excellent place  Kids friendly hotel Very clean and neat  The service was excellent! Special mention to Mr Anbu,Mr Sanjai,ms Azura,Chef Dinesh very welcoming and friendly. Service Top notch, impeccable, superb! Excellent Managers, Supervisors, and Staff. Not forgetting those chef who work in kitchen and serve delicious foods esp the Lamb Briyani 5 star for it. We loved everything about this hotel.Friendly staff and a place to spend quality time with my loved ones."
"Mr. Azan (if not mistaken) was very helpful and incredibly efficient when making my check in process. Spending my Christmas holidays here at Hilton. During my visits, the staff were very attentive and delightful, the atmosphere was rather pleasant; making this one of my favourite places to visit with friends and family or even alone! Many thanks, Hilton KL Staff especially Mr. Nazril and also Ms. Azura for the warm hospitality. Definitely will come again. :-)"
"This is a long overdue review as my family and I stayed here last October. But the warmth and excellence the hotel crew gave us stayed with us until this day. We stayed there for two nights and we were provided breakfast and hi-tea too. The breakfast was particularly memorable as the crew there (especially the supervisors; forgot their names) were attentive to our requests. They were went the extra miles and gave us a complimentary pancake on our second breakfast there. A kind gesture that we truly appreciate. On a different note, they also complied with all the Covid-19 SOPs. Overall, every aspect is excellent and I would definitely come here again."
"I‚Äôve decided to celebrate my 10th yr wedding anniversary at KL Hilton due to attractive promo. On the day we checked-in, I wanted to make it a special evening and surprise my wife by setting up the room and bath tub when we return from dinner. That‚Äôs when I strike up a conversation with Ikhwan Shah, he immediately took note on my special request. The minute my wife walked-in to the room after dinner, she was so speechless with tears of joy, she expressed her feelings of appreciation.   Ikhwan and Hilton team have made my wedding anniversary so meaningful and one we would never forget. From the bottom of our heart, we thank you for being apart on our special day!"
Upon arrival your concierge was very helpful and friendly. We manage to check in without a fuss since we were already prepared with all the documentation required prior to our stay the day before. Your front desk was friendly the reservation personel was helpful as well. I am very happy when we get to our room and it was sealed to assure that the room was sanitized and everything was great. The view is awesome. Nothing much to say except everything was great and very very accomodating. The food for breakfast was also great. Thank you for the pleasant stay and hospitality.
"It's my second time staying w/ Hilton this month and i can't complain much. The customer service is excellent, check in & check out process were smooth and fast. The staff are helpful to show & explain how to get to surrounding area. Room was nice & clean, decent tv channels.  However i wish they can improve their breakfast buffet. It's the same menu for both times I'm staying & for two consecutive morning. A little variety won't hurt :) Besides that everything else is wonderful."
"As a first timer guest at this hotel, I was totally disappointed with the hotel parking experience. After almost 10 hours of parking I just realized that there is no discount if I enter using Touch N Go card. I had been charged more than RM100 after almost 10hours of parking. It's almost half of my room rate! Imagine that if I go out the next day or few days later? Does the hotel realize how nonsense it is?  At the first place there is no warning sign of using the Touch N Go at the parking entrance especially for the hotel guest that at least will stay for a night. Furthermore, there was no information or explanation at all regarding the parking fee during checking-in. After complaining to concierge, they said they won‚Äôt compensate the amount charged on my Touch N Go card. Do"
Got upgraded to grand executive suite. They set up birthday suprise in the room and it was reaally nice. They also provided complimentary birthday cake as well and daughter was really delighted. I‚Äôve had birthday suprises in few hilton properties but this by far has been the best set up. I would like to thank the magic team eapecially. Check in was a breeze (had to wait but was less time than I was told to wait which is fine anyway considering the rooms were full I guess). Staff was excellent and very attentive from receptionto housekeeping to restaurants and breakfast was quite good I love it. Cant fault hilton KL at all and I would definitely come back again soon!. I highly recommend it!
"We arrived the hotel at 2pm. Informed the receptionist that we wanted to check in, but i have to wait for the check in time.   At 3, we went to the counter to check in, they said I have to queue up. While before that they said they will call me once ready to check in, and the queue is quite long.  Surprisingly, we are DIAMOND member and still have to queue up?  Where‚Äôs the honor counter?  I went to double tree Jakarta too but they got honor special counter so we dont need to queue up for long!  I dissatisfied and disappointed with this. Wasting my time with no reason.  But kudos to vasco team (chef aizat and team) for helping me to surprise my friend on her birthday!   And Nik Ezzwan Razzi for helping me on room set up.  Definitely will go back here and expect some improvement üôÉ"

"I am 57 yrs old and I can honestly say tonight was probably the the best steak I have ever tasted. Excellent is an understatement. 5 star. You have to to credit to the staff chef Brett, Nathan, hazinq, Ethan. They are masters at their profession.  The restaurant is run by adli to a very high standard. I would recommend this restaurant 1000 percent even though I know that doesn‚Äôt exist. Trust me you will not be disappointed."
Had a wonderful stay. Temperature checks upon entry of the property and appropriate cleaning precautions taken. Special mention to Ramlah & nor at vasco‚Äôs Restaurant was very effiecent in terms of customer understanding.Won't hesitate to return upon my next visit .keep it up
"Had a room upgrade thanks to Encik Ikhwan and indeed a lovely room with a view! Definitely my daughter's favourite room as it came with a nice bathroom with a bathtub. Clean room with good amenities, very comfortable. The swimming pool is worth visiting as there's a slide and it's very fun. The staff were all friendly as well as helpful with our needs. We will definitely return again for another staycation at Hilton KL. Thank you!"
"Had our room upgraded with a view and definitely my daughter's favorite room as it came with very nice bathtub. Clean and comfortable, l amenities are well maintained. Will return for next staycation!"
"Dinner @Chamber Grill was amazing, 100% satisfied with their food, ambiance & service especially from Adli the restaurant manager & fully recommended by ikhwan as soon as we arrived and we feel so welcomed for me & wife to dine in. The food from their appetizer, main course (wagyu tomahawk) & also dessert is 100% fabulous & absolutely beyond delicious!!   Also to add, their lobby decorations are so awesome! Me & wife just cant stop taking photo as both of us feels the ‚Äúseason greeting‚Äù mood is so ON! Their lighting, decor & of course the tall Christmas tree!!  Overall our night turns out to be so perfect & always going to be a night to remember @Hilton KL."
I booked a 2Nights 3days stay at the Hilton KL Executive Suite with access to the Executive Lounge. Upon my arrival at check in was only when I was told the lounge at Level 33 is temporary closed and they have moved their cocktail to one of their bars and breakfast to the main restaurant called Vasco. We did not mind much but we were certainly disappointed. And true enough in the evening when we went for the cocktail the service was so poor and bias and they platter was horrible. Food for the birds I can say. The food quantity was so Lil and the quality was so bad. What's worse is when we asked for refill of our wine the waitress was so rude. She literally ignored me when I asked for a refill and showed me her hand to wait. She later said there was no red wine when the red wine
"Had a chance to stay at this hotel. Due to CMCO cannot go outta town so need to stay at the city. Nice room, I love it! I need to work during second stay but hotel cannot serve the Breakfast delivered to my room, need to dine in. Such a shame because I cannot go down for Breakfast. However it was great staycation!"
"Room is nice, with comfy bed, with bath tub and shower. Sheets are clean. Everything is still up to standards, clean and modern. Like the sound from the radio( Soundfreaq) Bluetooth speaker, impressive sound! Good breakfast with western and asian varieties."
I had the best experience of staying in hilton. The service was very good especially at the lobby lounge. Ms. Azura did an excellent job in handling me and other customers as well. The view from my room was spectacular and very relaxing as well. The room was in tip top condition as I checked in. This is surely a great experience for anyone to have a short getaway.
"This my third time here,I‚Äôm feeling so disappointed for f&b service. Today I‚Äôm here seating at sofa area and would like to order a coffee from oro,there is no one attend us while waiting at coffee counter. One of indian male hostess said excuse me with high volume tone to me and friend. When there is Chinese male come to order, the same indian hostess with high intention to take an order,also when their staff come to order also they attend her (1400hrs-1430hrs), maybe I‚Äôm a Malay customer and cause I‚Äôm look poor. Spoiled my mood. Hopefully my stay will be nice and excellence."
"An unpleasant check-in experience. Arrive at the hotel at 2.30pm or so to a one hour checkin queue. By 3.30pm finally managed to checkin, but was told the room is ready but awaiting inspection and will take ‚Äòfew minutes‚Äô.  An hour and half later at 5pm, room is not ready and no one bothered to inform. When asked was told they will call me when room is ready. I asked for a time estimate - was curtly told that they will call when room is ready.  6 hours later, still no call. By 11pm, I gave up the wait and approached the front office, and voila, they say the room is available all along!  The receptionist generously offered a ‚Äò3pm checkout‚Äô to which I declined. Don‚Äôt want that to be the reason for another guest having to wait 9 hours for a room.  For perspective, I'm an Honors Gold"
"Pros: -Jim Ho, the receptionist was polite and well spoken - nice view from the 27th floor - gym was open - clean room - friendly staff  Cons: - heated water was turned off at 9am on the day of checkout, did not bother to investigate as we were leaving anyways. - pool was closed due to covid"
"I purchased HPC membership and stayed in the hotel on 31 Oct 2020. My membership had expired on the same day. Everything went well except they couldn‚Äôt cope with limited resources at their restaurants. I have 4 vouchers left to be used for dinner and I booked for 7.00 as I was advised that I need to place my order by 7.15pm. 6.45, we came and ordered our dinner. I was informed that the kitchen has stopped accepting orders. I argued that we have checked and was informed last order‚Äôs 715pm. The staff refused to accept our explanation and we left. We complained to the hotel manager and HPC to be told that they couldn‚Äôt extend the vouchers. We didn‚Äôt ask for vouchers extension. I was complaining about the bad service but the respond was ‚Äòwe couldn‚Äôt extend the voucher‚Äô. Literally."
"I will keep it snappy! In the current pandemic, of course when many amenities of Hilton has seen better days and while falling short now; however, the expectations were bridged eloquently by these two gentlemen - - Manager Mr. Adli and Chef Brett. Both gentlemen were omnipresent to our dining experience in Chambers Grill on the recent 14th Nov (2020) evening. The essential importance of not one but many personal touches are the bedrock of any hotel hospitality to win and beget its customers' staying satisfaction and takeaway experience(s) progressing to become loyal customer. My wife and myself have personally rejoiced our recent staying experience in Hilton KL from the 14th - 17th Nov 2020. There were many instances to quote but I will keep at that general phrase. Also as a"
"Thanks to Jim Ho , always helpful  and friendly  when check in  at Hilton . Enjoying my evening cocktails  at bar, and happy work out gym room with all friendly  staff there. Japanese food was good , will return  back soon ."
"Celebrated my birthday in Hilton KL during the RMCO period. Send a request to the hotel manager and he is very helpful and provide a very pleasant surprise to us. Also location is excellent as it is close to KL Sentral.   All in all, definitely a recommended place to stay."
"My wife and I had a short stay at Hilton KL recently. Although the pandemic is widespread, our visit made us feel secure as the ‚Äònew normal‚Äô and every effort was made to ensure that cleanliness and hygiene was maintained. A special thanks to Mr Ikhwan who made our check-in process smooth and also we had a nice anniversary surprise. Thank you also to Mr Ikhwan for recommending the delicious Japanese restaurant, as my wife enjoyed it very much. Will definitely return again."
"I don‚Äôt recall how many times I have been to this property but this is probably by far the best experience that I have had, staying here on my own.   I did have a couple of issues during the first few days of my stay but Gagan, the hotel manager has had everything sorted out, and I have not encountered any further issue thus far.   It is a good time to stay at Hilton as the rate is now really low, compared to before the pandemic hits the globe. Hilton also offers attractive long term stay benefit, which includes dining discounts.   The messaging feature that the hotel provides is really excellent too. The reply is very prompt and action is also taken immediately if required. I would like to thank both Zafrul and Nik specifically for helping me with all my requests and issues"
"*""Perfect for a romantic dinner for two""*  Besides a pleasant stay, a big thanks to Mr Ikhwan, my wife and I truly enjoyed the experience dining in this hotel's restaurant. Mr. Adli and his team were great, from arrival up to our departure.   The food, service, and care was outstanding. My request to surprise my wife worked tremendously well with the cooperation and hospitality provided by the Hilton team.   We went there early this month and still raving about our experience."
Hilton staff was so friendly and helpful.. The room also clean and nice.. The food is so delicious and fresh..  And thanks to the staff who decorate our room.. its so nice and lovely Will come again for sure with familyü§ó  Recommended!
"Stay at Hilton KL for 6 nights for outstation working purpose, the bed and pillow are superb comfy!! House keeping done their great job daily. Appreciate Hilton KL be the first to open the lounge cocktails hour at current tough situation for the diamond members. And their parking only cost RM3! Thanks for lower the 5 stars room rate but maintain the great service and facilities.   And yes, buffet breakfast!"
Lack of information during check in.  But the staff name Shahril was helpful and friendly.  Most of the staff are friendly.  Tv in the room not working well. Did inform to receptionist to call someone to fix it. But there is no action taken. Tv still not working until the day of check out.
"First of all, thank you for lowering the rates and making it affordable to more Malaysians during time of the pandemic where almost guests are locals. I hope the management remembers us locals who supported the hotel during these difficult times.  We stayed at the King Deluxe Plus room which is sort of a corner room with the lake, Parliament and Bukit Tunku view. Room is very clean and well maintained despite being almost 20 years old. Hilton is smart to brand and market their clean guarantee using the Clean Stay branding. Towels and robs were presented in a sealed box. The room was even sealed before our arrival...very much like how the papal apartments in Vatican City were sealed during sede vacante before a new Roman pontiff takes charge.  Separate bath tub and shower."
"First time staying here. Nice place,  condusive clean room. Great service from your front office team,  Ms Suan. She is very friendly and always put her face smile,  same goes to Mr Muizz from F&B team. Overall superb services"
"Stay for 2 nights, nice decent room with huge bathroom.the buffet breakfast was good. And the service at restaurant was great by Mr.Rames if I not mistaken the name. Thanks for the house keeping guys who keep my iPhone charger which I,left in the room when check out at room 3113. Overall worth the money for the promotion deal during RMCO."
"Before the whole pandemic, it was a great hotel. BUT during my recent stay, it was HORRIBLE! What‚Äôs the point of having ‚Äòclean stay‚Äô at the room‚Äôs door when the room wasn‚Äôt thoroughly clean?! I could see a long strand of hair on the clean hanging towel near the bathtub. YUCKS! Charging delivery fees for in room dining order (on top of overpriced menu) and each time we request for ice bucket is ridiculous. Breakfast buffet are limited to one hour of dining during RMCO with almost no social distancing SOP. I‚Äôm pretty sure the gap between my table & next table is LESS THAN 1 meter. I overheard next table conversation mentioning he saw someone with pink wristband (quarantine band) was at the buffet breakfast area the previous day. So called ‚Äòcheese platter‚Äô offered at buffet"
"As to support hotel's contactless policy, we chose not to have our room cleaned during our stay.  Hence we only called for towels to be changed. But at 3pm, shockingly, a housekeeping staff opened our door and came in with attempt to clean the room, without ringing the doorbell! Our kids were in the tub, with the sliding door ajar,which is right next to the main door! Our young children were in shock having a stranger standing at the door!!!  Following the incident and after 3 calls, a housekeeping manager came up to our room to address the issue with the reason that the staff actually went to the wrong room. Unacceptable & absurd excuse!  Feeling unjustified, we spoke to a Duty Manager at the reception, who committed that the incident will be escalated. We waited all day till"
"Located next to Le Meridien & Stesen Sentral KL made Hilton one of the busiest hotel during RMCO. with their best offer, we definitely grab their best offer for our staycation. thanks for wonderful experience staying in hilton sentral KL. though kids have limited time but they still enjoy pool time. we hope to see you again soon :)"
"Covid-19 made me appreciate my city more. There were lots of places to explore and lots of promotion by all hotels. I've been trying different types of hotel and different types of room. It was a good experience on how every hotel deal with the current pandemic.  What I like :- The staggered breakfast session. During check in, you have to choose your slot. 3 slots available with one break for sanitize session. This made me feel confident that they really taking things seriously.  What can be improved :- They should apply the same format for the swimming pool. Pre determined the slot, limit no of people in the pool and allocate time for sanitisation. Please ensure only properly attired guests are allowed in the pool. To have those with Jersey, shirts were big NO. You don't even"
"The food was very delicious and varieties. The workers are very helpful, especially En Anuar,manager, he treated us very good and he welcomed all of his guests like family. Totally recommended to eat at Vasco."
"Due to the Covid pandemic, travelling was a problem therefore we decide to have a family staycation locally. Deciding on Hilton KL Sentral was definately the best choice. Thanks to Ikhwan Shah, we had a beautiful view of the city with connected rooms which offers nice big comfy bed, kids love the swimming pool which include slides and waterfall. My only comments was the Internet Wi-Fi  require purchasing instead provided FOC by most of other hotels.  Other than that, its highly recommended stay with world class service and staff."
"Stayed here with family on merdeka night.. located just by KL Sentral, this hotel could provide you with all kind of public transports you can get in kl. From LRT, MRT, KTM, monorel, you named it.. and of course buses and taxi too. As you have the upper hand on public transport here, definitely a very good place for tourist to stay while connected to most of local attractions around kuala lumpur.  As for the room, it was spacious and clean and provided with channel tv, air-conditioned, fridge, iron board and kettle. The bed was so comfy, i could sleep there like a log. Toilet also spacious with bathtub and separated shower. Water pressure was good along with hot water, i was cleansed.. however, i wonder why they put that square desk in front of tv, as i found it not really"
I like the room more so is the dinner I had in chambers grill there I had good experience with the staff they were so nice especially the manager Mr Adli. Overall kl Hilton is definitely a better place to stay .
"One of my best experience of staying in this 5-star hotel. Superb services from the staff of front desk, housekeeping, room service, therapist Razali from the Spa and all staff from HH mobile apps. exquisite facility bedding, pillows, toiletries, massive bathtub and lake view from the room just heaven. Definitely will come again."
"It was an amazing experience! Great room, delicious foods and super friendly staffs! Special thanks to Ikhwan Shah who was very attentive and helpful during our stay. Definitely will come back again!!"
The hotel staff is great.  They really do go the extra mile to ensure that their guest are  well taken off.  I was doing some work and wanted ice cream.  I called room service and they said they were out.  2 minutes later Nik Ezwan rang me to said that they located an outlet with ice cream and had it delivered to the room.  Saved my night.  I have been staying with the Hilton for 4-5 years and travelled all over Europe.  They are my go to hotel unless there is no Hilton in the area.  They really are the BEST in service even in these difficult COVID 19 times...  Thank you all very much
"My family and I had dinner at Vasco on the 5th of September. The food selection especially the western cuisine was very good.   Special thanks to Annuar the operations manager and his team. Again, he provided great hospitality and very attentive to our requests. My family and I had a great evening. Annuar mentioned that there will b a ‚Äúworld cuisine‚Äù coming up with a wider spread mid Sept. We look forward to our next visit to Vasco. Many thanks, Jeremy"
"The KL Hilton shows you what can happen when you hire good people, invest in their training and then lead by personal example. It is a great quality hotel with world class customer service.   Staying in hotels during the Covid pandemic has really shown the good from the bad. This hotel has strict safety and hygiene policies in place - right from the lobby arrival. This gives you confidence that they will keep you safe and takes away some of the current stress we are all feeling (examples - individually wrapped towels and bath robes, even the TV remote control is sterilised and plastic wrapped for hygiene)   What makes this place such a hit for me is the quality of the staff and the level of customer service. Every single staff me ever whom i interacted with made me feel special."
"Everyone is so friendly here at this hotel! I am so amazed by every single member of this wonderful hotel. From the moment my family stepped into this hotel, we are greeted and everyone smiling. I am sure it's no easy feat, I am impressed, from the bellman, front office, housekeeping to random member we met in the lift!  It's not the first time I am in a Hilton hotel, and I have reviewed many hotels in my blog, I can see that Hilton KL place cleanliness a top priority. Impressed!  Thank you for making our staycation a perfect one! Keep up the great work! Will be back, hopefully soon!"
"Hilton truly offers 5 star experience with cozy beds and luxuriously spacious rooms. I had a great time here with my husband and 3 kids. We managed to get a joining room which made things a lot easier. The pool and gym facilities are indescribable, its just amazing. My kids had a problem with their aircon and it broke down in the middle of the night which was the only let down. Other than that, absolutely amazing definitely worth coming back."
"my stay at Hilton was amazing, i had a wonderfull breakfast at vasco. great servis from azu & ramlah. Love the breakfast spread and delicious food especially Curry Mee .Their covid SOP is amazing and i felt so safe staying with them. will repeat again."
"It was an excellent stay! Bed is super comfy, spacious room, bathroom with bathtub. Amazing services from all the teams especially Mr Ikhwan Shah. Great service from Chef, F&B service team & Concierge! Thanks a lot to Housekeeping team for the surprise balloons decor and turn down service by placing my kid's favorite unicorn on the bed. Love the breakfast spread and delicious food especially Curry Laksa. Definitely will come back and stay here!"
"My stay in Hilton Kuala Lumpur was amazing. Everything was perfect from easy parking , to friendly staff at check in and concierge , clean and huge rooms with all the amenities , delicious wide spread breakfast buffet , WiFi for Hilton honors members, Hilton‚Äôs dedication to adhere to the SOP & Hilton CleanStay and fast checkout.  The staff at the check in (ShahrulNizam I think) was very nice to me and my mother and very welcoming.  I had an amazing stay, so much so that I am making another trip to Hilton KL this coming weekend.  True Hilton Hospitality experienced. See you guys soon."
"Honestly, this was my first stay at Hilton KL. Did not know what to expect but figured it was worth the experience. I booked a 4 nights stay at the Hilton KL and upon check in, I was warmly greeted by Mr Harvin, the manager manning the check in. I was also acknowledged as a Diamond Honors member and was accorded an upgrade to a marvellous room overlooking the lake garden. The room itself was just perfect with a king sized bed, a table to work on, a lounge chaise located to the huge window offering a majestic view of KL‚Äôs lung. Linens were prepacked in boxes to ensure its cleanliness, in line with Hilton‚Äôs hygiene plege to its guests. I was also allowed access to the lounge of the 33rd floor and the staff there were just pleasant .. Ms Julyanna and Mr Jim. They took care of me"
"Nice hotel at KL central, easy access to train service, spacious room, breakfast was good compare to other hotel.  One bad things is the restaurant station queuing policy is very bad, guest can just simply cut queue instead of queue accordingly. Mean guest whom has queue for long time for food and can simply get cut queue by no manners guest. Hope the management take this as a serious issue some more is during RMCO situation."
"I had a wonderful & superb 90 minutes of Full Body massage and express facial today at The SPA, Hilton KL.  Thanks to my massage therapists, Amelia. Such a professional and world class massage. It was amazing experience of massage and facial i had today.  Highly recomended.   Thankyou so much The SPA Hilton KLüòç"
"I don‚Äôt normally write a review on the places I visited but this Spa at KL Hilton derserved it.  I‚Äôve decided to have a full body massage & Express Facial before my lunch at Mid Valley, the massage therapists (Razali & Jacquline) was superb professional & ALL i can say is WORLD CLASS. Other staff are all kind and very friendly.  Price is superb reasonable & for sure you can‚Äôt enjoy at any hotels in Kuala Lumpur.  If you want to be pampered and experience an amazing massage & facial then i recommend this is the place to go guysssss.   Thanks so much The Spa & Hilton Kuala Lumpur for amazing service.  Cheers, Azrel Ismail Malaysian celebrity"
"We had a lovely stay at Hilton. I didn‚Äôt get the name of the manager for our 2nd and 3rd day stay, but he was taking care of the breakfast. He made sure everything was going good for us, appreciate it too! I also love the live chat Hilton has, it‚Äôs so easy to request anything even when you‚Äôre not at the hotel. Akmal and Nik was very accommodating to our special requests as we were travelling with a baby so few things we couldn‚Äôt do and the kitchen and the team handling the live chat was understanding. Thank you to everyone of you for making our stay great, we hope to stay here again! My husband sends his big thank you to the Hotel Manager as well :)"
Excellent service by Ms Yip. Delicious and gorgeous food by chef lam. We would recommend this lovely restaurant and will try to go back again. We all had a lovely afternoon and everyone said the meals were superb.‚Äú
Visit Vasco to celebrate my mom birthday. Excellent service by the Vasco team . Special thanks to Chef Kazi for the surprise birthday cake and to the Dir Of Room Mr Ikhwan on the arrangment. My family came all the way from Malacca & N9 to dine in Hilton. The food is excellence and the service is very good. Keep it up!
"Friday night,was a incredible dinner and I would said 10/10 star. Food was awesome started with Kaiso Salad mixed green salad with special sauce (taste like peanut creamy sauces) and sparkle with crunchy artichoke is my favourite. We also try sushi with fresh tuna. Yummy! Not forgotten the wonderful steak It was as tender, juicy and flavourful. Mixed seafood and vegetables Tempura was delicious. We also try garlic rice bowl, big bowl, and sorry I can‚Äôt eat all. For dessert of course green tea ice cream with red bean is the best ü§ó. One of us had tryout seafood set that complete set sushi and sashimi,grilled cod fish and custard egg I guess with mixed tempura and kaisen miso bowl. All amazing presentation. You got wonderful food and the most important and impressed me is the"
