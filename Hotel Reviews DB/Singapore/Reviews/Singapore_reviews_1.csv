"A truely enjoyable stay. The hotel environment is excellent, the moment we entered the hotel lobby we felt refresh and welcomed. Ambience is excellent. Rooms were big , cozy and clean. Atrium lounge is the beauty of this hotel. A nice place to chill with friends and family. Swimming pool was family friendly. Breakfast at Edge was good."
"The staffs were very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is so special that it really felt like home. The room was awesome and full of facilities which were higher than my expectation. I'll recommend Pan Pacific hotel to every couple and families:). You wont regret it,just be there:)"
"After a long travel drought, we decided to have a family staycation and went with a stay at Pan Pacific Singapore. We chose a weekday stay to avoid the crowds and were rewarded with quick and efficient service at check-in by the receptionists. The rooms were clean and made the stay comfortable. We also had a delicious dinner buffet at Edge even though the selection was reduced due to Covid measures."
"Stay with Pan Pac was superb, better than Marina *** S*nds. Terrific service, shout out to Charles who made everything fantastic! and Nook who made check in so smooth & hassle free :)  Breakfast & Dinner at Edge buffet restaurant was good, able to walk around freely despite Covid, safe distancing & crowd control managed well!   Will definitely recommend my fam & friends!"
It was a smooth sailing and good experience overall. Staff are very nice and attentive when I informed them that it was our anniversary. Jayrick from front desk was very helpful and informed us of the necessary. Will definitely come back again and recommend.
"Was greeted warmly at the check in reception by Abhi. He is friendly, helpful and welcoming. He answered all our queries and we enjoyed our stay, thanks Abhi! üôÇüëçüèª Breakfast was also good, wide spread and friendly staff over buffet counter"
Had a pleasant stay at the Harbour King Studio Room. Kudos to Abhi for checking us in promptly and to the rest of the staff there. My friends arranged for Pan Pacific to pass me my birthday card and present and the hotel responded promptly. Room was big and in tip top condition. No complaints at all!
It's our Family Vacation and we chose Pan Pacific as the Hotel for our Stayacation because of the 60% super deal! Warmest and friendliest welcome by Pacific Ambassador Charles! Friday is the Best day for Staycay because the Hotel isn't busy! We checked in by 230pm and started to enjoy all the hotel facilities! 38sqm pacific club connecting rooms with king/twin beds is perfect for our family! Room is spacious and clean. Mini bar was included. We proceeded to Pacific Club Lounge for afternoon tea at 3pm! The staff are very thoughtful. They offered us a really cosy corner and specially prepared treats for our girls! Swimming pool wasn't crowded on a Friday afternoon and it is nice that they have these big and colourful floats for us to use! Evening cocktail starts from 6pm to 8pm
"Up for a classic English Afternoon Tea with your date with perhaps a spot of tea? Fret not! Pan Pacific brings you their revamped experience at the Atrium. However, do note we visited sometime ago.  Nonetheless. For SGD 76 (for 2 pax), you‚Äôll get a lovely 3 tiered selection of both sweet and savouries brought together with an explosion of flavours consisting of treats such as Shaved Virginia Ham Sandwich with Truffle Mayonnaise, Strawberry Pistachio Choux, Dark Chocolate Pear Caramel and Coffee Caramel Roulade with a portion of scones served with butter, cream and jam.   All in all quite a nice experience and our ideal way to pass an afternoon. Service was lovely with the servers being dears. Pretty attentive and jovial.  Price: SGD 76 per pair.  Our full review is on Instagram"
"We reached the hotel at 3.30pm and attended by Mr Abhi.His service was excellent and try the best to arrange our request as because we booked both nights under different website.Besides, he also explained very well to us very details that we need to know.Not to forget, there was a guy welcome us at the main door I am not sure his name but he was very helpful by offering us bellman to deliver our luggage to our room.Will come to stay again as the room also was clean and spacious too!"
Room is clean. Shopping within the walking distance. Service staff are professional and accommodative. Breakfast buffet is good and the spread is just right. Gym and swimming pool are not over crowded.
Hye there ...  Just drop by here to tell that this service man Mr.Kuselan has been a great person on welcoming us from the first day till we check out ... he as been amazing from the first day we reached and till the moment we walk out from this hotel ...   Hindu person who is also working on the Indian new year on our Hindu date 14/04/2021 must be a big commitment and overwhelming point ...  As we the customer by doing our part we do hope that the management will do they level best in valuing such a employee and bring him up together so that this will be more people like him in future ...  I do hope I can get back a review on what is the management have done to value such a employee so that we know by what we doing he minimum can give what kind of priorities by the management
"Back to Pan Pacific Singapore after seeing some photos on the newly renovated Pacific Harbour Studio. Trust me, if you're into large spaces and large tubs, this is for you!   PPSG is no stranger in my group of friends. No doubt I like spending time here, but every time is always something new or memorable. The studio suite, is even better in person (although I kinda hope the view will be full view instead of 90 degrees view of the Marina Bay only.) If you have stay in PPSG before, you'll recognize the warm hospitality, the comfort in your room and the quality of the amenities. This time no change, but extra friendly services from Jayrick. Kudos to him for all the arrangements.   The suite includes a big tub (which take a long time to fill, ensure you fill it in advance to use)."
"Room was extremely large, with great harbour view. Pool is the best! My kids love it. It would have been good if the upgrade was complimentary given that there were still rooms available.   Nonetheless, the upgrade wasn‚Äôt as pricey at the hotel compared online."
"One of the best staycations I‚Äôve had. All the staff are friendly and attentive, the place is clean and the food is great. The staff would try their best to accommodate to the requests I made and would always ask if you require any other assistance. I felt so at home during my stay. Would definitely visit again!"
"Had a very pleasant anniversary stay with pan pacific. It was a seamless experience arranging for the deco before our check in. I was promptly attended by Ayaka when I enquired about arranging deco. We then communicated via whatsapp on the follow ups. I came to the hotel the night before and was pleasantly greeted by Thiagu, I passed him the flowers to safekeep in the fridge.  On check in day, I liaised with Ayaka on receiving the balloons and flower petal. She was very proactive in handling my requests. The set up she did for us was impeccable! Ayaka met us during check in and she was so kind and pleasant. We were sitting initially and we she came, we wanted to stand but she insisted that we remain seated. While I was signing the papers, she chatted with us to avoid any awkward"
Booked my stay using the SG Discovery Voucher for a club room and was upgraded as a courtesy due to my Discovery black membership...thank you PanPac! though it was not a qualifying stay :P Pacific Club l..the place I missed since the CB started and it was GOOD to be back! Food and service was excellent and a shout out to the Pacific Club lounge staff members who always makes one feel at home and very comfortable. Special shout out to Ms. Shine who as always provides an exceptional level of service on all my stays. Overall ..a very good stay and a very relaxing environment to unwind and with an excellent view of the Marina Harbour.
accessible to the nearest mall so not to afraid that you cant find food when you are hungry! Great staff that served us. Told us abt the discount privileges that we can get as hotel guests if we dine in the restaurants. He allowed us to check into the room even though we reached early at around 12.30pm. We really appreciate much! Thumbs up to Mr Abhi!
"Have a warm welcome from the concierge team when arriving the hotel. Front office team will great during check-in. Will be back again to have a stay-cation. Breakfast was great , facilities was great too."
Thank you Roxanne for your wonderful service. Really appreciate it! Coming from hotel line I know the difference of genuine service and whats not. Hotel was perfect besides the upsell issue. Staff and cleanliness and F&B was perfect. The hotel itself was peaceful!
Book this staycation for my family and was served by Mr Arbi. He is very patience with my requests and explained all the necessary hotel information to me. Thumbs up for his excellent service! Room was very clean with a nice view and big bathtub.
"My second time staying with mom and helper. Staff was very hospitable and helpful. We were welcomed warmly by Reception officer Mr Arbi who was very patient and professional. Our breakfast at Edge was made personable by Janice and her team who attended patiently to my elderly mom. We stayed in the Skyline Suite at level 32. The view was simply breath-taking. The bathroom was spacious and luxurious! Overall, the service was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Even when we were leaving, the uncle at the taxi stand was very helpful and made sure we got a cab. Thank you Pan Pacific for making our stay a memorable one!"
Great location for shopping and a walk along the river. My family and I had a comfortable and relaxing 3D2N staycation. Hotel staff are friendly and helpful. Checking in and out was a breeze. Room was comfortable.
We planned at staycation at pan pacific singapore and the room was modern and view was great. Bed was very comfortable and the bathtub is very big. The staffs are friendly and helpful. Breakfast at edge not many options as compare to before covid.
"3rd time staying at Pan Pacific, twice to celebrate our anniversary. Tip top service from them. Received a complimentary cake and goodies. They managed to arrange for connecting rooms for us and our 4 children. Fuss free system of booking facilities but unfortunately it rained heavily and we didn't get to swim. Very convenient to get to Marina Square and Suntec City as they are connected."
"I would like to personally thank Dickson and D‚Äôcruz who have assisted me and my family to have a smooth check-in yesterday despite the long queue. I can see that all the staff are working professionally despite the high occupancy in their hotel.   Our room was clean, spacious and my kids enjoy their stay here. Hotel location is definitely a plus point as it is near to Suntec City shopping centre and Marina Square. We will definitely come back again for another staycation. Pan Pacific Singapore really live up to their 5 star standard."
"Check in was fast and social distancing was adhered to. Adhi from Pan pacific front desk provided fantastic service, and made our stay very pleasant. Pan pac is also very convenient to the malls, I would definitely visit the hotel again."
"We truly enjoyed our stay from 6th to 8th April 2021. From our room on 34th floor, we had an excellent view of Marina Bay. The 360 deg unobstructed view from the club at 38th floor was spectacular especially at night. We took many photos.  The spread for breakfast at the Edge and cocktail at the club were excellent.  The service was superb and we would like to thank the following staff for making our stay so wonderful.  Abhi from reception Hiffi from the club Rosemary and Siti from the Edge  Joseph Choo and Catherine Foo"
"Had the most awesome stay at pan pac Singapore with my family! The kids love it, I love it and my hubby too! Room was spacious and clean, view from my room balcony was great and the hotel's service was spectacular! Want to give a shout out to, Abhi in particular, he made our check in particularly fast and smooth. Loved that he arranged a cot especially for my baby and even gave a birthday surprise to my older son as it's his 4th birthday. Thanks so much pan pac for everything!"
"Brought my family for a staycation and was greeted with an excellent stay made better by the service provided by Abhi at the reception. The room was luxurious and comfortable. Swimming pool was nice for swimming with my son. Abhi was really courteous and helpful in ensuring that we had the best stay possible even though it was quite a busy day, being a Friday check in. I would definitely recommend the hotel and Abhi for any visitors in future."
"Staycation from 5-7 April 2021. Impressed with the service given by the staff at the Reception (YiLing and Ayaka) and the Edge (Ivy) . attentive, patient and very helpful bunch. Takes pride in their work and full of initiative. Location is very accessible to the places we want to go. Our room is v clean. although no bidet spray in the toilet for our poo-ing business but that is fine because everything else is excellent, haha. Thank you so much for making our staycation so pleasant."
"Nice view, great customer service, clean room.. best recommended for couples wishes to stay for couple of nights. Best staycation ever.. Thanks Mr Abhi from the front desk counter for arranging us this best view, high floor Room"
"Hotel was amazing, gave us free upgrades with amazing service by the hotel. Abhi was really helpful and assist us throughout the whole stay in pan pacific hotel. I would definitely come back and enjoy another stay here."
"Here our first visit, the front desk receiption staff ‚ÄúABHI‚Äù is extremely great and accommodating. The room is clean and comfy, definitely will recommend to our friend and will visit again in the future"
"I just spent the long Good Friday weekend at the hotel & I had another great time. Great service by all staff at the reception, restaurant as well as our doormen. Check-in did not take long, I felt welcomed throughout my stay especially at the Pacific club lounge where they remembered me. Special mention to be made to Shine, Angel at pacific club who makes me feel so at home, service staff who‚Äôs on duty at the edge for pac club members fr 3-4 Apr for their great service, Jane at the reception for recognising me & welcoming me back, and our doorman kuselan & Ismail  for their great service. Thanks everyone! I will be back soon!"
"Our one night stay with Pan Pacific Singapore was delightfully marked with exceptional great customer service. We were greeted by friendly front desk manager, Abhi, who professionally assisted us in checking in, and tried his best to accommodate to our various requests and enquiries.   We had brunch at Keyaki, which serves authentic Japanese cuisine. The food was pleasant to the palates. However, due to a miscommunication, there was a slight unhappiness which was quickly resolved by the manager, Vincent, who addressed our concerns in a prompt and caring manner.  In short, we were really impressed by the quality of customer service in this hotel where guests are treated with respect and you could tell the staff goes out of their way to make guests feel welcome and be at home."
"Everything was as expected for a 4-5 hotel. Room was spotless, staff very attentive, Internet was excellent. Fuss free stay, no issues whatsoever. Value-wise, I would not recommend PanPac - as I have stayed at other on-par hotels with same service standards at lower rates."
"Had our family staycation at Pan Pacific from 3/04/21 to 4/04/21.  Check in was smooth, & we were pleasantly surprised when we got into our room- cleanliness spot on & spacious. So glad we managed to book our swimming pool session & my toddler had so much fun. Pool was not crowded too.   During our check out, we were fortunate to bump into Mr Khalili who helped us with our stroller & luggage as our hands are full handling our daughter.   Mr Khalili readily offered to help us all the way through our checkout process till we are out at the pick up point. He is also great in entertaining kids!   Thank you Mr Khalili for the exemplary service & we will definitely be back again Pan Pacific!"
"My husband and I had the most amazing 8-course private dining experience at the Keyaki Restaurant's private tatami room for his birthday celebration! Overlooking a little garden, the tatami room was a beautiful place full of serenity. Soft calming music played in the background and a coat hanger was available. The tatami floor and seats were absolutely gorgeous. We booked the entire space to ourselves, and for the whole 3.5-hours, we were served by the Japanese restaurant manager who was exceptional - very polite, detail-oriented and thoughtful. We truly felt like we had been transported to Japan!   The manager and chefs went above and well beyond my expectations in helping me prepare for this celebration. To book the tatami private dining room, a minimum spend of $700 on total"
"It's best if it serve halal food either than that everything is good and enjoyable..location is near to all, nice view,  cleanliness is top notch instruction given is very precise and clear...simple check out"
"take a long time to check in but hotel compensate with late check out, stay for my wife birthday but do not receive anything even a piece of cake from hotel is quite disappointed (compare to other hotel), in room TV not working need to get technician to fix it."
"Always enjoy staying in this hotel during staycation, to get away from daily routine. Location is near shopping malls & train stations, with plenty choices of food. Down side is the price, which is slightly high."
"Stayed at the pacific harbour studio with club access and it was AMAZING. We had a celebratory occasion going on and the staff did something special for us with balloons which was very much appreciated! The room was clean and spacious so highly recommended.   The club access brings you stunning view of the city.. the food spread was not as sumptuous as pre-covid times but I must say it is pretty decent.   If there is one reason I'd return to the club lounge, it would be to enjoy the conversation and service of your staff Evan and the crew serving at the club access floor.   Evan has been a warm ray of sunlight (even at dusk) who has been wonderfully attentive to my partner and my needs, and charmingly personable to make us feel comfortable. Her knowledge of the cocktails was so"
"We had a relaxing stay in your lovely property at the beginning of a long weekend. Thank you to your friendly Chef Concierge Jimmy and Yan from IRD team for making us feel welcome and special. We didn‚Äôt feel like checking out, till next time!"
"Upon arrival, guest service officer khalili approached us and helped us with the check in procedures. We were seated at the lounge while he process the check in for us knowing im pregnant. It was a very nice gesture and we felt very welcomed. Great service and 5 star rating for him!"
It was a great experience on staying to this hotel.Thank you for valuing us healthcare workers. The ambiance was serene. I feel relaxed during my stay here which I needed for a long time. Recommended!
Staycation at Pan Pacific Singapore in March 2021.   Services is excellent.   Breakfast at edge restaurant is excellent as well.   Only thing to improve on perhaps will be on the pillow quality.  Too soft and low already.
"Great hotel, but the check-in queues were terribly long. Kudos to Ms Edeline Tiong who managed the entire situation well, and still managed to maintain a calm and patient demeanor the entire time. Great job!"
"We were impressed the excellent service extended to us from the moment we stepped out of the cab. TJ met us with much enthusiasm at the door that even my kids were thrilled by him; your friendly receptionist, specifically Yiling and Natalie were friendly and helpful during check in and check out (they actually remembered us out of the many guests that they encountered!); Shugar and Kenneth were also quick to serve and help us during dinner in the EDGE; the housekeeping lady that served us (room 2108) was also prompt in bringing us our request, and each time we bumped into her along the corridor, she greets us with a smile (Yes, even under her masks, we know she is smiling) ; the staff at the pool were polite too!  All in all, we are glad we chose to stay with Pan Pacific for our"
"Pan Pacific Hotel is always our top choice for hotel stay in Singapore. Mr Abhi is so friendly and awesome, who will ensure our stay is perfect and enjoyable one. Will let the picture do the saying ( city view of Singapore )"
Excellent service. Ahbi at the reception counter was such a delight. He was super warm and welcoming. Very clean and spacious room. Will definitely pay another visit. All our requests have been fulfilled.
"Booked 2 rooms for our family staycation. Fast check-in & check-out. Excellent service rendered. All the amenities fulfilled. Walking distance to shopping malls such as Marina Square, Millenia Walk. Definitely recommend this hotel for couples/families or even work. A big thank you to Ms Yi Ling and Ms Natalie for assisting my family & myself checking in on 29/3/2021."
"Celebrated my honeymoon here for 3D2N‚ù§ Shoutout to the reception staff ABHI, who helped us and was super friendly and jovialüòÉ Helped us get a high floor with a superb view‚úåOverall experience was great with a super comfy king size bedü§ü"
"First & foremost , I would liked to express my utmost gratitude to you for your generous appreciation to us members of ‚Äúmedical front liners‚Äù. Your beautiful staffs are greatly helpful and welcoming, would liked to commend Ms Sel who was particularly friendly and accomodating . Thanks guys"
"It‚Äôs a fabulous staycation that we experienced, their service and facilities was excellent, friendly staff and accommodating. Will come back for sure for another stress relieve staycation. They strictly follow properly the Covid safety protocol which is very important during this pandemic crisis."
"Waiting time was short during Check-In. Would like to thank Mr. Abhi who assisted with our check in process, appreciated his prompt and efficient service.   Breakfast at the edge restaurant was pleasant as well.  Overall, the services are great, would visit Pan Pacific again."
"The good: - Check-in was very fast, cleared check-in within 15 mins. Requested a late check-out and got 1pm check-out. - Express check-out by passing room key to staff as I do not have additional payments to make. - The staff are polite and professional, will be happy to answer yr queries, ranging from reservation to front office to main door. - The view from Panaromic Room is fantastic, got the room facing suntec. The lift was facing outside rather than inside which was nice. - Sufficient amount of power plugs, a lot of switches to control different lighting. - Sheltered walkway to marina square and suntec city.  The bad: - Equipment may be slightly dated, receiver for the blind is spoiled, had to get 2 engineers around 1 hr to fix it. - Some lighting were flashing, issue was"
"Thanks for this lovely staycay, had a great time with my family. Room was very spacious and clean, the stay was really comfy. Food quality at Keyaki has dropped a little since my last visit. Food at Edge buffet was still good as usual!"
"Queue was very long at the checking in on a Saturday afternoon. Thought it would be long wait, but the staffs were efficient in clearing the queue. Upon our turn, Abhi made our experience turned surprise and wonderful. Usually, hotel requests were usually ignored but he tried his best to fulfil our hotel requests as we had indicated during the booking. With such friendly and efficient work rate from him, I would certainly revisit pan pacific again."
"We would first like to a laud doorman Mr. Ismail for his warmth and kindness when he took the initiative to greet, and subsequently offered directions to nearby shopping malls.  Upon checking in on 25 March 2021 at around 3pm, there were two long queues at the Reception Counter. I am heartened to see members of your staff taking the initiative to direct some of the guests to the three counters on the left (Departure, ?Redemption) which certainly expedited the check-in process. We would like to commend Ms. Jane, who was very polite and helpful, and ensured a smooth check-in process.  We would like to laud Ms. Sammi for her soft-spoken and corteous demeanour. Ms. Sammi was very patient with our enquiries when explained thoroughly to us the differences between the room charges and"
Thank you Mr Raymond and FNB team for making our actual wedding reception a memorable one. Thanks for guiding us throughout the whole dinner process and gave the guests flower petals to throw and playing bubbles even though we did not request for them. We deeply appreciate all the hardwork you have done:)
"We have a nice stay at Pan Pacific (Singapore). They served good food and excellence services from the service staffs, particularly Jane, the front desk staff. She‚Äôs knowledgeable & rendered personalised service by sending our room keys to us  when we‚Äôre at the poolside."
All was ok except for food... Please have halal breakfast next time for the muslims and vegetarian for the vegans... And the reception staff said no pork no lard but when I went for my breakfast there was pork in the menu... I couldn‚Äôt eat at all I‚Äôm a Muslim...
Stayed here for a birthday surprise staycation. Despite the initial long check-in lines (#COVIDtimes) the staff quickly opened up additional counters elsewhere to move things along. The hotel seemed to be at full capacity and staff were working flat out but took the time show us around the hotel and gave us a few extras that just made our stay special.  Don‚Äôt miss a ride on the tallest external glass elevators in Singapore!
"It was really a pleasant surprise to receive something special for our Anniversary. Initially, when we indicate in our email about our Anniversary, it was not taken notice, but we're so wrong. We went out for a short while, and when we came back, viola, there's something for us to celebrate our Anniversary together. It was really memorable. Thank you soooooo much, Pan Pacific Hotel, for making us feel loved & honoured during our stay.  Oh, we wished your pillows were available for us to purchase (unfortunately, not in stock), my hubby and I just simply love how soft and fluffy your pillows are.."
"Booked a staycation at the Pan Pacific for my birthday. Lovely staff and check in was quite efficient! Special shout out to Roxanne at the concierge for being super attentive and accommodating. Immediately noticed it was my birthday and helped me with a late check out ‚ù§. The Pan Pacific is one of my family's fave hotels in Sg. It's the first time I'm coming back without them. While coming alone is not as fun, glad that their warm hospitality has stayed the same. Excited for the next few hours"
"We had a pleasant stay here at Pan Pacific Singapore where the staffs are friendly and efficient. Especially to a staff by the name of Rina Almenenza, Cris and Jane providing us the best assistance and service. Definitely we will stay here again in future and fully recommending this hotel to everyone."
Thank you to pam pacific staff. They give a vey great welcome and helpful. All of them frm manager level til room houskeeper. Never fail to SMILE. Such a relax place to stay. Would like to come again. To bring my parents along..... gd job pan pacific.. keep the good team work.
"If you are visiting Singapore, I highly recommend you to stay at Pan Pacific Singapore as the staff are very friendly and efficient. The hotel has a very high standard of cleanliness and the room is very comfortable. A special mention to Rina, Cris and Jane who have helped me alot during my stay."
All the staff is very accommodating especially  Rina Almenenza and Jane . This kind of staff should give more compliment for being a good staff ...easy communication and understand all our needs. The amenities is good for baby...our grand daughter really enjoy swimming.
Our stay was much more meaningful because of the staffs warm welcome. Sel from the check in counter was really helpful and accomodated us  well. Its my first time in this hotel and the staffs gestures and superb accomodation would want me to come back again.
"If only the toilet have bidet or water spray otherwise everything else is excellent from the room cleanliness, to breakfast menu, to feeling hospitality, friendly staff and importantly we had a good sleep."
"I would like to thank & express my appreciation to all staff og Pan Pacific Singapore for their warm & kind service during our stay in your luxurious hotel.So much grateful & impressed for your treat in recognition to us as healthcare workers making us Super heroes during this time of pandemic. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to one of your staff at the front deck ,Mr.Jayrick for being so friendly,helpful,accomodating & most especially for the kind gesture for arranging a surprised complimentary birthday sweets for me.Greatly amazed! I will surely treasure every moments of staying at Pan Pacific.I am happy & proud to share my wonderful experience to my friends & colleagues! Once again thank you,more power & God bless!"
"My stay at Pan Pac was a comfortable and fuss-free experience! Even with the safe distancing measures in place, the wait to check-in did not take long, and we were attended to promptly. Our requests were also heard, and the front counter staff, Abhi was patient and extremely friendly! Also conveniently located next to Marina Square, access in and about was great!"
We booked a balcony room and the view we had was amazing. We managed to utilize the balcony and also enjoyed everything in the room and hotel that was provided. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We would definitely love come and stay again.
"In behalf of my friend i would to thank Pan Pacific for the appreciation they give us during this time of pandemic. It give us more courage to face this difficult time to boost our self. My deepest thank‚Äôs to one of ur staff Mr. Jayrick for being accomodating, much appreciated."
"Great Views, Great Room, Great service by the pacific club, and those cocktails really got me in a good high. will definitely come back again for the champagne breakfast... breakfast service was fast and mimosas were on point!!!"
"Service was excellent and the staff were attentive and friendly. The room was clean, spacious and had a great view both in the day and at night. Hotel is also close to other shopping centres and the MRT. Wish I was staying longer... but reality beckons."
Lack of trash bins and housekeeping service didn‚Äôt appear until late afternoon when we were getting the kids ready for their nap. Had to wait outside sky room for 30min with a cranky child to wait for housekeeper to do her work. Didn‚Äôt refill the necessary items. I chose pan pac as I was gifted a stay as a healthcare worker. This is my third stay and it has disappointed me.
"All staff are very accomodating specially Sel. We have a great time duting our stay. The room is very clean, ambiance is quiet and very relaxing. The aminities are great. We enjoy swimming and the pools are very clean."
The room assigned to me in the start was very stuffy and would give me headache. The duty manager changed my room and the stay was much more pleasant. I got very impressed with Mr. Abel communication skills. He knows his job. Kudos to him.
"Had a great stay.. Overall I'm satisfied w the services.. Convenient location for shopping..  Fm my check in till my check out everything was smooth.. Thanks to all the friendly staff.. TJ, Daniel, Uncle Abdul n Uncle Ismail.. I've forgotten some of their names so sorry.. U guys are üëç.."
Excellent service given by Mr Khalili D cruz. He was very helpful and proactive.  I had a pleasant dining experiemce throughout. Very courteous service rendered. Thank you very much. Great hospitality!
"Hotel is clearly not ready to receive so many bookings during March School holidays so ending up a long queue for almost 2hours just to check in. Room was small and old, not much refreshment was given, internet connect was super bad.  Pool is super dirty, the pool walls and floor are slippery and slimy. Imagine the bacteria growth in the pool, simple no maintenance. No lifeguard around and with so many kids, its dangerous."
"Pan Pacific has always been our first choice of staycation in Singapore for a relaxing getaway due to its friendly staff and the level 38 lounge with a breathtaking view for many years, however our previous staycation ( a first since the start of the Covid) was disappointing. We are having 2nd thoughts if we will make Pan Pacific our next staycation option. What has make the difference and have made Pan Pacific our preferred hotels again, all thanks to 1.	 A staff who is professional and genuinely interested in asking feedback  during our previous Dec‚Äô20 checkout 2.	Jayrick who has make our recent 6 days stay the most memorable one with his personalized touch with the arrangement of red wine + cake for my birthday celebration. 3.	Special thanks to the team at Club (Level 38),"
"Checked in on 20/03/2021. While queuing, we were approached by officer Khalili. He made the check-in fast and breeze. We had a pleasant check in. Great customer service here!  Hotel amenities were great too. Room was spacious and we got a high floor room which was great too!  Would definitely return again not just because of the hotel amenities, but the friendly and great staffs they have too! Well done!"
"There was a bit of a queue during check-in on 18/3. However, ground staff including the Guest Services Executive was efficient to ensure hotel guests are happy.   Will definitely come to stay for next staycation :)"
"I have a memorable one day stay with my girls on the 18th March 2021. We was served by Mr Abhi during our check in time for the ""HERO""(Healthcare Employees Recognition & Ovation). Despite the long que for the check in,we que for an hour to check in. Mr Abhi displayed his patience,professionalism and good service towards us! Thank you so much,Mr Abhi! For you excellence service on the 18th March 2021."
"The room was well-equipped with automatic curtains that could black out both the bedrooms and toilet. Loved that the toilet had three shower features too!   I‚Äôd like to thank Ahbi for the smooth check in and also Azminah for walking me through over the phone with finding the hotel lobby in the mall after 11pm (and all the usual entrances were closed). Really appreciate the service and comfortable stay despite the new Covid normal. Although many guests were staying over this period, it was nice to see the staff being so friendly and kind :)"
"We understood that it was the holidays and the hotel was packed. We booked a breakfast slot upon check in for next day‚Äôs breakfast.   As we turned up at breakfast, we were ushered to the lobby view. We placed our orders and was curious as the drinks were not in the menu. We asked about the choices that the restaurant offer.   From then on, after placing our orders, we were treated invisible, not even our attempt to raise or wave our hands could capture anyone‚Äôs attention to get some dark soya sauce for my soft-boiled egg. The nasi lemak‚Äôs rice was as though it was not cooked at all.   Janice also saw us seeking assistance but decided to speak with her 2 other indian gentlemen in suits.   After waiting for 15 minutes of no availability of assistance, we called the hotel main line"
"The deal I bought gives me room upgrade and some free amenity( 2 local delights) but I didn‚Äôt get any of the 2. Housekeeping was abysmal. They still left all the dirty mugs, cups and bags of rubbish in my room. Housekeeping staff is irritated and one particular staff at the edge raises his voice at my hubby for asking for a spoon. Room service is equally bad. My food trolley was left outside my room for 24 hours at least! The leftover food started to smell that‚Äôs how bad it was. The only thing fast and efficient was the check out."
The room and facilities in the hotel exceed my expectation! Though only downside was the check-in process. Check-in took some time. Maybe because it the March school holiday But still great experience!
"Check-in and check-out was a breeze. Staff at main entrance, concierge and dining area were friendly. Rooms and facilities around within hotel are noted to be very clean as well. Rooms are still fully carpeted."
"We booked ‚ÄòHarbour Suite‚Äô room and it is just LOVE üòç  Nothing else!   It‚Äôs huge Bath tub is what my kids kept talking about!  This is our 2nd time staying @ Pan Pacific Singapore! Reason being:  1. Super friendly staff and SUPERB SERVICE by their VIP Team especially Jayric, Jane, TJ and even their bellman are very well service oriented. Thank you so much for your kind assistance every before checking-In.  2. The huge bath tube and spacious room (Harbour Suite) are just love   3. Their pool provides unicorn float! Who does tht?? Tho it‚Äôs first come first serve...  4. Lounge staff celebrated my mum‚Äôs birthday and they are all so sweet! Even printed a picture of my family.   5. Sauna in their Harbour suite ROOM guys!!   6. Super convenient - connected to a mall & food, shopping"
"For the price I paid for the family package, I don't think it was very worth it. Kids' activities were only happening on the weekends. Given that it's school holidays, they should have more kids activities even on weekdays.   The worse experience was at breakfast. I felt like I was eating in the canteen. Food choices were very limited, pale in comparison to pre-covid days. There were other hotels who could offer better menu even in covid times.   We were rushed to finish our breakfast within a certain time, food cannot be customised. They were all prepared beforehand and thrown onto your table. It was really a far cry from before."
"Decided to return to Pan Pacific Singapore after our first experience in 2019. A big thank YOU to Roxanne Caluza for personally attending to my reservation and ensuring everything was in order by the time I checked in. Got a room at level 11. Wished I had a room at a higher floor but I understood that it was not possible due to an ongoing event.  Had some issues at first on the first day when our room was not turned down at 8 pm despite 8 pm being the agreed time but eventually that was sorted out & since then, the housekeeping dept did a fantastic job of ensuring that our room was kept clean and tidy twice a day (daily housekeeping at 10 am & turn down service at 8 pm).  We had an issue with the bathroom door too on the first day. The maintenance personnel came and said he"
"Stayed here more than 15 years ago and during this re-visit, the first impression of the lobby was that it was somehow ‚Äúoff-focus‚Äù, probably due to the domes of Atrium at the background, giving it a clustered feeling within the same area and doesn‚Äôt give you the grand feeling of an open field like the Shang Orchard. The lobby also could do with more sofa to provide some ‚Äúfocus‚Äù and also for the guests families members to take a seat while one of them is checking in.   Despite 8-9 counters functioning, the check-in still took half an hour at an off-peak 1pm timing but hey, this was the school holidays in a staycation craze year so I was in a way lucky when they informed me to check in at a 1pm timing. The front desk manager who was manning the queue, could probably do with a bit"
"good location. local foods are easily found and accessible. many shopping areas around the hotel and they are only walking distance. hotel foods are nice too.  due to covid, the only issue with the shopping malls is that we need to do alot of scanning when entering the malls."
"My husband and I were here for our 2nd wedding anniversary after reading rave reviews online. Pan Pacific did not disappoint. Check in was smooth with the assistance of Mr Jayrick and through his recommendation, we upgraded our room to the Harbour Studio facing Marina Bay. View was amazing, especially at night! The Pacific Club, served by Jayrick, Angel, Evan and Tanya was equally excellent. The team‚Äôs service was impeccable and we thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon tea and dinner cocktails, surveying the panoramic view at Level 38. Will be back again!"
"Stayed for 1 night in deluxe room, king sized bed was super comfy, great view seeing the city of Singapore. Pool service and gym with towel and water provided. Buffet breakfast was perfect. Thank you Pan pacific for the awesome stay!   Regards Fellow healthcare worker"
