"Stayed in ParkRoyal Pickering for a birthday staycation. Central location and lots of food options around. Overall, It was an amazing experience. Room is spacious and clean. I got a bath tub at a very reasonable price. Plus, they sent a birthday cake to my room! ParkRoyal is one of my Go-To hotels."
"It was a wonderful and nice experience.  Food- good,  room- excellent,  people- friendly and polite special mention to both Twinkle, Shahina (she was alone on duty at club lounge for the evening cocktail). They made us feel very welcomed and at home.  Given a chance, we will come back for round 2."
"Since my husband and I have our anniversary in April, we decided to avail ourselves of the government’s offer and book a staycation at a subsidy.  We chose Parkroyal because of its distinctive architecture and good location.  I booked a club room because we enjoy things like all-day beverages and snacks.  We enjoyed our stay of 2D1N very much and here are some small touches that really made a difference: 1. High tea starts at 2pm but our check in time was supposed to be from 3pm.  I emailed the hotel and I got a response from Serene saying no worries, we could just come up to the lounge and get started with tea at 2pm.  We checked in seamlessly upon our arrival at 2 and were scoffing down scones in no time! 2. Evening cocktails was very fun, and the bartenders were obliging with"
"I would like to thank Serene and her team for the excellent service provided at the Collection Lounge.  The place was clean and cozy and the food and drinks were served quickly. They have different menu for different day of the week.  The staff were also attentive in checking if we needed more food and drinks.    Not forgetting to mention Chin at the check-in, she was very patient in going through the facilities, procedures and recommended rooms with nice scenery that met our request of having our rooms to be side-by-side.    We spent a pleasant and relaxing afternoon there.  Keep up with the excellent service!"
"My friends and I stayed at the Collection Room for one night.  Our room was clean and the service from check-in to the Collection Lounge, breakfast and check-out were very good.  The staff were attentive and willing to do their best to meet the guests' request.  I would like to thank Serene and her team (including intern Jia Ying)  for the excellent service at the Collection Lounge.  Their service were prompt and they came to our table to ask if we needed more food and drinks several times during our stay there.  We also met Serene at the Lime Restaurant for breakfast and she remembered us.  She even made me a special cup of cappuccino with little coffee taste when she knew that I don't like coffee but wanted to try.  It was really good!   When she saw us waiting to check-out on"
"We had a staycation with friends in the weekdays.  The hotel is clean , and the collection lounge food on Thursday was very good. The drinks , hot and cold had variety is wide and good.  Breakfast is good too . When we asked for things outside of the menu , the team was accommodating too . Overall service is excellent, thank you Serene and her team for her attentive care and friendly service. Made us feel very welcome. Thanks very much."
"Stumbled upon this package, Suite Dreams Come True when browsing for next staycation. Wasn’t aware there’s such package from my last stay, I must say overall value wise it’s definitely a steal.   This is my second stay with PARKROYAL Pickering, the first was the same Junior Suite (under Collection which the difference was only the toiletries - non-Collection has the standard where Collection equip with Elemis). Suite wise nothing to shoutout, I still think this is one of the nicer, and affordable suite stay in Singapore. This time I request for a different view, and so they place me next to their Urban settings which was pretty.   The whole package includes “black car” return transfer (which was excellent), 2hrs of massage at St Gregory SPA (standard, I’d say one of the smaller"
"Beautiful hotel with beautiful view. However, I went during the march school holidays and all facilities were fully booked. And should have more TV channels and also a bidet. Overall 7/10 only. the room is comfortable."
"We check-out of the hotel on 4th April 2021 and had a horrible staycation.  No staff was at the driveway to welcome or assist us with our luggage. My wife had to carry our baby and struggle with the baby pram in the taxi boot while i was paying the taxi fare.  I was only given a room at 6pm when the check-in time stated 3pm. The counter staff explained that the housekeeping could not cope and the room was still being clean.  When I check-out on 4/4/21 at about 1200 noon, there was no one to assist us with our luggage or taxi calling. My family with a baby in tow had to call a taxi on our own at the driveway. While waiting for the taxi to arrive at the taxi stand, a blond European guy was swinging his golf club wildly in front of us. When i told him that my family is behind him,"
Attended the complementary cooking class today. Afiri the chef taught us how to make seafood pasta. He  was very friendly throughout and detailed with his instructions that I found really insightful. Great experience :)
"Checking in was easy. Junior suite is clean and pleasant. We also met a friendly staff that assisted us on check-in, accommodating our request and answering our enquiries. Minutes to Chinatown which is convenient to get food as well. A nice place where you will wan to chill and relax as couple. Other than swimming pool, nothing much for kids to do here. Overall is still a good experience and thank you Mr. Thomas at front desk that assisted us throughout the stay!"
"I had the best staycation ever! Even i got for an appreciation gift for healthcare workers, i’m so glad i got Parkroyal Collection Pickering! I get to spend my time with my family. Seeing them happy makes me feel more happier. We get to spend alot of lovely and happily time. It’s been so long and that was much needed for me to see them that excited! It feels so great and i’m so happy! Thank you for your kind service, the delicious breakfast, the pool and everything, i love everything about it! <3"
"A great green and lush oasis in the city centre, love the greenery scattered throughout the hotel. The pool was a bit small but adequate. Theres is a nice ""forest"" walk just beside the pool. The food at Lime cafe is mediocre however, you are better dining at the food centre just next to the hotel, cheap, delicious and spoilt for choices."
"Impressive getaway experience. Start your buffet breakfast with freshly cut tropical fruits and freshly squeezed juice. You don’t have to stand with this new normal situation. All will be delivered at your table. Upon entry at the Lime restaurant, welcome greet is expected,and you will be brought to your desired seat.  Facilities are far unique among other places. The pool is defined with a unique architecture of bird cage like design. The pool is good to depict am infinity connection to the city horizon. There is a jacuzzi beside the lap pool. There is a patio on the right-side upon exiting the 5th floor lift lobby while the pool is on the left. The hotel in my own word is the hybrid concept of modern and environmental ecology so you won’t feel the bustle of life in the city."
"My experience was less than satisfactory. I booked for 2 complimentary in-house activities - mixologist experience and garden tour. Both activities did not take place despite confirmation via email prior to the dates, as well as during check in. We were told that the mixologist did not turn up when we reported for the activity at the lime bar at 3pm and were offered a glass of wine as an apology. The garden tour was worse - we received a confirmation call at about 10+am confirming the tour scheduled for 11.30am and to meet at level 5. We reached before 11.30am and waited till 11.45am. There was no staff deployed to conduct the tour. There was an ROM ceremony and when my husband tried to enter the garden next to where the ROM ceremony was held to check if there was any staff"
"Back for another staycation. Everything is not only good, but I would say very good. The garden view room. . The more than friendly service from all the staff I met. The fantastic location of the hotel. However, I had a very strange experience with the One Connect service person on duty on 27Mar (Sat) around 4pm. I called to inform that I do not need housekeeping for my 3 day stay. I was told, please call back tomorrow as she has no way to notify. I was like ‘fine, then can I have r extra towels’? The operator asked ‘how many?’. I said 3. She said ‘how many people is staying in the room?’. Me ‘2’. She replied ‘hmm... you need that many??’. Me ‘well, it’s for 3 days and I do not want housekeeping and there’s only 2 towels in the room now’. I didn’t see a need to explain that my"
"The room is not thoroughly cleaned before I checked in, with dirty bits, dust and hair remaining everywhere. Even if I requested for recleaning TWICE, the cleaning job is not properly done. Unbelievable for a five star and award winning hotel."
wonderful amenities and exciting adventure of the area. a recommended stay of delight and soulful rejuvenation. room was a pleasant tropical encapsulation of senses and very neat and tidy with a refreshing concept in comparison to other 5-6 star hotels.
Good location with lots of nice restaurants/food around. Instagramable swimming pool. Room is clean and bed is comfy. Breakfast is good but should have more variety. Most important services is good. Manage to get early check in too. Thumbs up.
Good stay and excellent concierge services. Perhaps more variety of vegetarian dishes in the normal menu would be a great help. Food quality is great and the morning breakfast service is well managed and the staff is sincere and diligent.
"Always wanted to stay in this hotel with magnificent facade. Managed to get early check-in. However, not much explanation on the facilities, the how-to, bookings available, etc. Luckily, having stayed at other hotel, we managed to figure things out.   Upon entering the room, to our horror, guess what we found in the mini fridge? A ‘naked’ instant noodle with sauce packets and disposable fork. There was also a yellowish ‘spill’. We called ‘0’ and the person on the line told us to throw it away ourselves and that sometimes, the mini fridge is ‘auto-locked’. Whatever that meant.   Nevertheless, this made me doubt if all the rooms is thoroughly cleaned and whether standards are compromised due to ‘fully booked’ status. Moreover, we are still in the middle of a pandemic. This has"
"Beware. We received our keys at 5pm even though we were at the hotel at 2pm and requested early check in. They didn’t give a hoot about us when we explained we needed the room at check in time because we had a small child with us who needed to nap. In fact, the staff at the counter told me, “ Check in time at 3pm means check in FROM 3pm”"
"Went there for a staycation but end up getting really disappointed. The exterior of the hotel looks so beautiful but the interior is deteriorating so quickly. Upon entering the room, was greeted by a TV that doesn’t work and a really dirty notepad. The coffee and tea selection provided in the room is also disappointing, it is probably what a budget hotel would provide. Overall, definitely not worth price."
"Efficient check-in service, fuse free!  Room is clean and minimalistic, love the woody, eco theme of the room. Storage space is well-placed and hidden from sight.  Rain shower water flow is just nice, not too weak. Bath tub only available in some rooms.  Location of the hotel is fantastic! Situated right in between Clark Quay and Chinatown, there is no lack of things to do and food to eat!  Hong Lim market and food is just right beside. Lots of famous and awesome food, can takeaway and bring back to hotel room to enjoy!  Pool has a nice view but water is cold cause there is no direct sunlight. This also means that you can save on your sun screen.   Fitness area is small but has dumbbells and some machines to get your essentials in.   Express check-out. Just pass the room card to"
"Warmly greeted at the check in counter, fascinated by the hotel lobby. Stayed in lifestyle room, nice view with lots of greenery. Room is clean and cosy. Infinity pool and gym is great for a relaxing swim and well deserved work out. Hotel is conveniently located near shopping malls and MRT station."
"The room was very spacious and comfortable. Loved the massage at the spa. Champagne breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails were wonderful too. The service staff were very friendly, especially Serene Teo, Twinkle and Min Lin. Will surely recommend this hotel to our friends. My husband and totally enjoyed our stay.    M/M R. Ang"
"Location is the best! Near to china town, clark quay and marina bay as well. Good place to stay-clean and nice room! Good food and accommodating staff from front desk,dining to security staff! And most especially to the housekeeping for maintaing the clean room all the time!"
"Bought the suite dreams come thru package which comprises of 2 pax, 1hr full body massage, lime buffet dinner, and free hotel transfer to and fro. Upon check in, we were told that we are also given the collection club lounge privilege which includes high tea, evening cocktail and breakfast. A shout out to Twinkle from the collection club lounge for her impeccable service. The hotel massage was superb too and room was very clean. Things to improve: - some gym equipment were rusty and old, the weights on one of the machines were  not even visible - buffet selection and quality seem to be lacking. Will not be willing to pay for it - service replies. Wrote in an email to amend my dinner booking date but did not receive a reply. Called the hot desk to amend the hotel transfer timing"
"I have been in this Hotel for a few months. Fantastic staff. Hope to be back soon, very nice view room, club lounge and lime restaurant to try. Thanks to Dervyn, Serene, Chef Thye, Edmond, Sylvia, Claudia, Chin and all the staff. Great location, near to the center. To try  Thank you so much, see you soon."
"Stayed for 2nights. Overall staff service was good, they were friendly as well. But one of my concerns is that the toilet does not have bidet shower. For those who are not used to just wiping off with tissue after toileting, it is very troublesome to go inside the shower cubicle and wash off using the shower spray.  Also only few choices for breakfast buffet. For me the price is still expensive for the worth of the accommodation."
"20 march 1.30pm  We had some issues with the facilities booking and tried to seek help at the front desk. However, it was the school holidays and the front counters were extremely understaffed. I tried approaching a lady on the furthest right counter (she’s sitting down and the counter says “discovery”) and she was extremely rude when i tried to explain my issue to her nicely. (I think she may be the senior in charge there as she was wearing a black formal jacket while everybody else were wearing a grey jacket) she stared us down and snapped at us unrelentingly. I gave up and decided to approach Ms Chin at another counter and reiterated my issues to her (in the exact manner as how i told the lady in the black jacket). Ms Chin’s attitude was completely different. She listened to"
"Waited 2-3 hours at hotel lobby to get our rooms. No drinks or alternative was offered. Facility like the pool was fully booked. While the room is spacious and view is good, it is sad that time to enjoy is shorten due to long wait for our rooms and without a room number, pool facilities cannot be booked."
"1) Concierge cannot assign a room for us under HERO initiative - Room was booked way back, check in time was supposed to be 3pm but I got my room at 9+pm  2) Concierge lady told us “we’ve been hearing this today” with a not-so-nice tone - Is it a customer role to help make your staff feel better by absorbing the negative vibe? We didn’t even scold her and we are just asking.   3) Staff Nigel at Lime restaurant was rude - while speaking to him, he keep looking at the computer and typing his stuff instead of focusing on our need - My husband and I asked about having dinner while waiting for our room but we were being rejected as restaurant was full  - We offered to wait but they say will not have a seat as there’s late night reservation too  4) Breakfast not confirmed even with"
"1) Reach the hotel around 2.30 PM, and we only manage to register for the check in at around 5pm plus. This itself already took us almost 3 hours of waiting time just for the check in. To make matter worst, we were advised the room will only be probably ready by another 1 or 2 hours. Which means the room will be ready around 7 or 8pm? And we are simply brush off by the reason that this arise due to school holiday.  2) Issues with the condition of the bathroom’s drainage system. Was in extreme shock to see the water has overflow till the entrance area because the drainage is not in working condition.  To make things worst, we explained this situation (this happened around 11 PM plus) to the front desk and requested for staff to clean up the area. However we were being told the"
"It was a much needed break for us since we can’t travel due to Covid.   The room we got was clean and with good amenities. The location of the hotel is also very good, near to shopping malls, MRT & eateries."
"Although the hotel was crowded as it's the march holiday, the staff were patient, friendly and efficient.  although the check in queue was long but the wait time was acceptable.  Thank you to the team for working hard.    We love the  well appointed Lifestyle junior suite with its full length windows offering excellent views of the city.   We enjoyed the afternoon tea, evening drinks and canapes at the club lounge.  Pricier rooms yes, but feel that it's worth it.  the pool was beautiful and the greenery very soothing.  Location was excellent with so many food options nearby and good public transport network (MRT and buses) .  We had breakfast one morning @ Lime and the other @ the Club Louge.  The wait @ Lime was longer during the ""peak hour"" - around 30 minutes for our pancakes"
"Check-in process is fast and smooth, better orchestrated than most of the hotels in singapore. And despite the COVID putting strains on manpower and etc., the food and drinks still maintain its standard, great as usual. And I wanted to specially extend my thank you to Serene from the Club Lounge team, who has been super friendly, helpful with excellent service on all the interactions.   Last but least, hotels have been hit the most in this current crisis. And to my knowledge many hotels have cut their headcount quite substantially. As a customer, let’s try to be more understanding for the stay. Together we can make it through. Don’t forget to put on a smile to the staff that rendered help to you :)"
"Nothing was explained. Most of the staff looked high and mighty. They don’t even bother telling you what to look out for like booking the pool or breakfast. Everything I knew was based on my research. When I asked for parking, the person gave me a smirk and said all hotels give complimentary parking. You could just say your hotel offers it instead of a rude comment that was unnecessary."
"Poor service, poor management.   The service given by the GM is poor and non empathetic. He do not allow guest to 3pm giving reasons such as 200 rooms are not clean and not ready for guest. Most guests gotten their room after 6pm. As for me, I got mine at 6.45pm. There were no service recovery and they had no system in checking in or staggering time for guests. Given excuses such as 200 rooms are not clean is unacceptable."
the front office service was effkcient. the room urban junior suite is gorgeous with floor to ceiling windows open to the city. there is a big sitting area comfortable bed with plants outside the window on one side. The bathtub is next to a big window and the big toilet has his and hers vanity counter. its worth every cent
"We stayed at your hotel on the 17th of March. We came by to your hotel at 145pm, do the registration and we were happy to be told that we will be getting room on the highest floor which is LVL 15 and upgraded to Lifestyle Room. We waited almost 1 hour for our room with no refreshments offered while waiting. Upon getting our key card, we were surprised that our room is on the 12th floor and it is based on our normal booking. So, our disappointment starts.   As our booking is a back to back one, however, we were not informed that we need revalidate our keycard in the morning. Our key card did not work not only once but twice, we have to re queue for almost 20mins. My kids, my husband and myself were already so tired from our activities and looking forward to our dinner. Due to"
"Terrible checking-in experience. Given key card that is faulty and was still faulty on approaching service staff a second time. Each of these approach to the counter staff required considerable waiting, hence increasing the frustration."
Late check in at 8 pm when check in started at 3 pm. Inflexible staff. Staff were giving out rooms that were preassigned with guests that have checked in earlier made to wait for their preassigned room. Ridiculous.
"We spent the holiday and celebrated a birthday last February 2021 with The Suite Life package. We had a pleasant stay, and we recommend to others reading this to consider The Suite Life package as well.  We would like to thank Ms. Thavamanie and Ms. Rosie for coordinating with us prior to our stay, and to Ms. Jen and Ms. Serene who had been helpful and accommodating during our stay."
"Stayed there for two weeks in March and had a wonderful experience!   The location was perfect, right next to Chinatown and Clarke Quay, just a few minutes walk to so many food and shopping options.  Loved the interior design of the signature king room. so many windows and mirrors make the room so bright and pleasant to stay in. Room was sparkly clean as well.  Special shout out to Chin at the reception who was so heart warming and helpful throughout my stay there! I would definitely recommend anyone visiting Singapore to stay at Parkroyal Pickering!"
"This is the most ridiculous hotel experience I've ever encountered. Came to check in at 2.30pm.and the queue was super long and super slow. And managed to reach the check in counter at 3.35pm. And yet have to wait for 45mins for my signature room to be ready. My Infant is wailing and my preschooler is agitated and so was I. And at 4.30pm we came to collect the keys after haggling and keeping our cool at the lobby and was told to wait another hour! Poor service! Buck up man! It's only school holidays and not even or a PH and the service sucks! And well saying goodbye to a $200+ for being MIA  eventhough  we are physically there. ""GOOD JOB"" management! Wake up man!"
"This is the first time iv ever encountered such experience in Singapore that had made me wait for a room for over 6 hours, let alone the long queue waiting to just check in. I am not sure if this is a common practice for parkroyal pickering but as a first timer,  I can say I was truly disappointed with the management.I am not one to complain or give a bad review on anything because I know everyone is trying their best to meet expectations. But the overbooking, understaffed and late check in, is not acceptable. I understand if the wait is an hour or so, but this is just bad. I paid over 300 bucks to check in at 8pm? I'm lucky I used klook for discounts.   And what's sad about it is, its just one day.  This is the one time me and my husband wanted a staycation as he works as a"
5 hours to check in...Never change bedsheet for my 3 days stay...never provide enough towel ..No alternate option provided when room is not ready to check in..Terrible frontline and not sure how to handle when there is issue..
"Hi,  With regard to my unpleasant experience at your hotel on the date, (photo attached). Firstly we waited 2 hours to check in. What a joke.  There were other guest shouting in the lobby, but none of the staff bothered to calm the guest down.   Guaranteed late check out at 4pm was not honoured by the hotel. I booked your hotel is because of this late 4pm check out.  I spoked to your staff kelly shum regarding this issue during my check in, she said that she will get back to me on my late check out, but she didn't. As such this hotel have a way of writing and saying things without honouring.  I still have to call the front desk, to enquire about my own check out timing. What is this kind of service? Its really unacceptable.  Please do take down your guaranteed check out at 4pm"
"My family and I had a fantastic stay in this hotel for our staycation recently. I would particularly like to praise the staff who checked us in, Ms Kelly. She was very warm and efficient, and made the check in process smooth and trouble free. The stay included breakfast, and Ms Kelly took the initiative to book us a slot for our breakfast during our check in. We also enjoyed our dinner at the Lime restaurant. Overall, all the staff at this hotel were very friendly and helpful and my family and I enjoyed our stay here.  Room#1329 & #1307"
"First time staying at ParkRoyal Room 1218, room is clean and big. My kid love the swimming pool and the view is stunning.   Thank you for the kind hospitality and kudos to the housekeeping team for making the room ready for the guest to check in.  I will definitely return to this hotel for my next staycation.  Keep up the good work !"
"It was supposed to be a birthday staycation treat for my girlfriend and it turned out to be our worst hotel experience ever. We checked in before 2pm and were told that our room will only be available at 5pm and we will get a call. We came back to the hotel close to 5pm to a chaotic mess at the lobby and queued to speak to concierge service again. The lobby was jam packed with guests with no seats around. Queued until 6pm and I was not even close to the concierge. Thereafter, I managed to get hold of this staff standing around by the name of Norman. He checked and told us that our room is not ready, he paid me lip service that he will expedite it to be ready in 30min and we will get a call from him. We went to the garden and waited until 7.30pm. I went down and could not locate"
"We had an enjoyable staycation during this March school holidays! Location was great and central, with various public transport options available for those who don't drive. The room was spacious, clean and good amenities provided. The front office executive by the name of Ms Chin was extremely polite, friendly and patient despite our requests and enquiries. Uncle Ang from the housekeeping department was another staff who deserves to be commended. We definitely recommend this hotel and hope to be back again!"
"Expect to wait for hours without room, and get turn away at the pool with no replacement slot. If you are booking the collection rooms then luckily you, least u can chill at the lounge. Otherwise, go home and wait."
We are a family of 2 adults and 3 young children and we took two rooms 915 and 916 from 14-15 March 2021. It was the birthday month for my daughter and myself. One room was complimentary as part of the Healthcare HERO program while we paid for an additional room.  My advise to families with young children  1. Avoid these rooms as they located along a narrow corridor with short metal poles along it (see photo). This can be dangerous for children who may try to climb over the poles.  2. The condition of room 915 was poor (see photo on bathtub and washbasin). The washbasin has multiple brownish stains and looks disgusting. This was highlighted for the duty manager who eventually came back to confirm that it’s a permanent stain. That’s it - no offer to change room or what so ever -
Service crew were patient and responded promptly to requests and queries. Helped arrange for late check-out and bathtub based on availability. Room was fitted with a relaxing bathtub and modern design. Views from room and pool were magnificent.
"This staycation was absolutely fantastic. Due to my GHA Black status, I was instantly given early check in and late check out. With the 6pm late check out, it provided extra time to fully enjoy the facilities. I was able to take my time in the gym and stroll around the area without the rush of checking out.  The “green” theme is very prominent in this hotel and shows in the multiple plants decorating many areas of the hotel. When you walk into the hotel, you see plants. The entire gym and pool floor is adorned with plants and you can even take a “nature walk” around the floor admiring all the different plants. To access our room, we walked through an open air corridor also adorned with plants. This hotel would please any nature lover. The green theme is also shown in the room"
"Had a great stay in Park Royal on Pickering once more. This time, once again because of the staff.  Upon arriving at the hotel, to our horror. The queue was really long! It was all the way to the guest lift of the hotel. Even as club room guest or even with our membership level, we have to queue all the way to the back. there wasn’t a single dedicated check in for hotel higher status membership guests. This is definitely something that other hotels are doing better. I really hope the hotel management can do something about this. Even direct check in at club lounge will be good. There are reasons why guests pay extra or even achieved the higher membership status.   Luckily, we met with great and friendly, Serene who remembered us and know of our membership status and current"
"Check-in: Ok without long queue. Lobby was inviting. Front desk explained the benefits of the club booking but the staff missed out the tour bus ticket and welcome drink.  Room: Decent size, not huge but ok. Bathroom though small, is well-designed. Supposedly eco-friendly. Sanitizer care pack provided, a nice touch.  Club Lounge: Views and décor are amazing, that's about it. Food during high-tea and evening canapés are disappointing. All served together and cold. Cocktail was good though took pretty long to serve.  Breakfast: Nothing much to shout about, at least the eggs and beehoon were served warm. Plus point was the champagne.   Property: The key selling point, very green and nicely maintained. Pool with great view. We had nice walks around the gardens and found a hidden"
"Check-in - Was expecting some sort of a welcome email sent prior to the stay for booking of facilities like what other hotels are doing, but I did not receive any of such.. i called the hotel at 12nn the day before my stay to request for early check-in but was told to call back after 9pm to check again as they cannot decide so early. Was eventually told I could check-in at 1pm. In my call I also asked about booking of facilities and the staff took down my swimming pool timeslot booking request. However, upon checking in at front desk, we were told that our pool booking was not keyed in at all. Hmm.   Room - We chose the Lifestyle King room with tub. Had to make a special request for the room with tub because not all rooms come with a tub. The room was spacious and beautiful with"
Recently booked 2 rooms from the collection series (Allows lounge visit)  Lounge review - Extremely poor selection of food and poor quality - It is no wonder there were very few guests in the lounge. Food were of poor quality and does not justify the additional money for lounge access.  Champagne breakfast - It is now at the main Lime restaurant. There does not seem to be any separation or identification of any sort between collection guests vs other guests which makes it difficult for collection guests to be served champagne  promptly. Appreciate if the hotel can consider having a separate section for collection member.  Check In - Appears that there is no separate check in line for Discovery Platinum/Black members and collection guests unlike the other hotels.   Front desk
"We enjoyed our staycation!!It was a nice experience to us and very comfortable too!!Staffs were nice and approachable,special mention to Mr. Ibrahim(receptionist) for assisting us with our concerns.Thank you!!"
"We would like to commend for a job well done by IBRAHIM, one of the receptionists at Park Royal Hotel Pickering. He is very approachable and accomodating to  our inquiries despite his hectic duties. Kudos! Great job!"
The staff were helpful and attentive during my staycations at ParkRoyal Hotel Pickering. The hotel is situated near Chinatown. It is very convenient and allow us to search for good food and safe time to travel.
"Extended our complimentary stay and enjoyed the infinity pool and spa.  Front desk Ms Chin was kind enough to accommodate us a good high floor room and served us with a smile.  An enjoyable refreshing spa by masseuse Ms Jasmine.   However, the toilet doesn't have the function of bidet/sprinkler. It'd be better to have it.  Overall, pleasant stay."
"Our stay in Pickering was our favourite among the many staycations we had. The location was amazing, the rooms were perfect however the service from the staff were the best part of our stay! They made us feel at home from the moment we stepped into the hotel and were attentive to all details. The service at the club lounge was intimate and special as the staff ensured we were well take care of at all times. Our massage at the spa was also perfect. Special thanks to front desk staff Chin, Masseuse Ada and Siti, staff at club lounge and the many others we came across during our stay. We would like to sincerely compliment staff serene who probably gave us the best service we had received in any hotel thus far. From the moment she started chatting with us she put us at absolute"
"I used to frequent this hotel a lot, but was disappointed on a recent stay.  It took forever to check in, we had to que like a boarding school for breakfast- and offered the most sub-standard breakfast I  have seen at a hotel- again referencing boarding school! The staff were rude and no one (not even the manager) bothered to greet us when we left breakfast- which we didn't even eat! The room was not super clean and the pool needs maintenance- part of the wood structure fell off whilst we were in the pool!   I appreciate the covid shifts- but all the staycations I have had have really embraced this and made me want to return not the opposite! I wished I just stayed at home.  I am hugely disappointed that I sent an email regarding our stay- and no one bothered to reply. Hence"
"To Mr Jason Khew (Banquet Manager In Charge),   We would like to thank you for making our wedding a smooth and joyous one. We are still in awe when we look back on everything you did for us before, during and after the wedding. From preparing the plates for the snacks in the boardroom to ensuring our guests enjoy every moment of our wedding, we can’t thank you enough. Without your help our special day would not have been the picture-perfect event we always dreamed of. Your planning, preparation, and attention to detail was amazing. Thank you so much Jason!"
"An excellent package that addressed all details from home pick-up, room decoration and Champaign, to an extensive dinner and couples SPA treatment -- well done:) This is an iconic venue that stands tall in the Singapore skyline as a testament to vertical gardening in urban settings..."
Good service in general. 😊Twinkle was very nice  Chefs were all nice too  Food at lounge is so so only needs improvement  Wasn’t upgraded which was sad as there was no bath tub. collection club rooms should all come with bath tubs as they are premium rooms Location is quite good next to Chinatown  Rained both days no chance to go pool area.  Kind of them to give a bday cake !  Check out was done for us quickly too !
An excellent hotel with good location and all your needs catered for. A big clean comfortable room. Good internet connectivity. No problem in finding food. Shopping areas nearby. Swimming pool and a gym for a workout. Also there’s St Gregory Spa for tired muscles.
"Really thankful to the hotel for upgrading my family to the Collection Suite. Personal attention & excellent service from senior management & all the hotel staff was superb! Suite was fantastically huge,beautiful & clean with high ceilings & tall mirrors. Had well-equipped kitchenette, luxurious furnishings & full round dining table for guests. The best highlight of my stay was the lovely cake, champagne, fruits & sweets the hotel surprised me with on my birthday, including handwritten cards from the GM & CEO! Thank you ParkRoyal Collection Pickering, it was the most wonderful stay & fabulous birthday celebration I ever had! Not to mention the Club Lounge, well-equipped Fitness Centre & Infinity Pool which kept me & my family fully occupied throughout our stay at this eco Garden"
"Stayed three nights here for a staycation. Hotel room is very nice and clean.   The free bottles of water has a cap that isn’t easy to open and broke easily. Pool is quite nice, even if there’s never actual sun directly on the pool longer than a few minutes. If you’re interested in a sunny pool, this isn’t one of them.   The restaurant food is just okay, the pool side food and drink service takes a long time to arrive, and food quality could be better. I had nasi goreng special, and it was mediocre compared to the hotels of the same standards like Hyatt or Hilton.   Upon check in, a hotel pamphlet was given with room key about the exclusive deals you get when you are a hotel guest. In the leaflet it says 20% off spa, 30% off in house dining and in-room dining, and other"
"This was our first stay at a Parkroyal hotel and it was amazing. The design of this hotel and its rooms has impressed us thoroughly. The junior suite room was a good size, with an excellent bathroom design. The view within the room and outside the room were both aesthetically pleasing from all angles. The pool and gym were easy to access and were great to use. The birthday cake was a pleasant surprise and we had a fantastic stay. This hotel has left a deep impression on us and we can't wait to be back."
The way out and relax with your special someone especiallythis time during covid that all the borders are close. To distress and pamper oneself and have a good time. Thank you for making our stay worth it.
"Very grateful to Parkroyal Pickering for their appreciation to healthcare workers. My sister, a healthcare worker and her family were treated to an upgrade to the presidential suite for her birthday. Complete with champagne and beautiful cake, mcaroons and designer treats. Thank you very much!!   I especially love the greenery and the organic curves of the architecture. The service here is amazing. I highly recommend it for a staycation."
"A pleasant stay few hiccups tho like worktable panel not functioning.. mis com in lime dinning.. system of ordering , they could have given a proper instructions prior to dinning like telling us if we are getting alacarte we should not open buffet choices... or might aswell provide 2 qr and scan wth separate phones.. at least guest have choices and pls instruct not to share meals before we eat not during, i felt bad after i finishd eating 1 sushi.. but the steak was excellent the staffs were all nice. .all in all very pleasant stay"
"we got this voucher as part of appreciation for healthcare workers in Singapore and this was the designated hotel.  It was a great choice.  Room was great, ambiance is good and location is convenient.  We didn't experience much of hotel staff service since it was only an overnight stay, but we would definitely choose this hotel in the future staycations."
Super nice and beautiful hotel.  I recommend the Urban  Junior Suite.  Staff very helpful. Very clean and a customer focused MD! Super good located close to China Town. Marina area in walking distance. Food was also delicious.
"I ended up staying for 3 nights at PC Pickering because their service was excellent. I suddenly longed for a staycation and with PCP’s garden view room, sustainable architecture, and accessibility, i dont think it will be my last time staying there.   My very special thanks to Chin from the checkin counter who was very kind and generous to offer us the best service to make our stay worthwhile, even providing my request for complimentary fruits which they wouldnt normally do.  Also to Jeffrey who never got tired of giving us reasonable amount of any supplies we need in our room.   Even if it’s in the city, because it’s near chinatown with lots of options for food, i did feel that for a while i wasnt in singapore at all!"
"Rude staff. Overrated. Only looks pretty on the outside (pool). Asked for a HDMI cable over the phone. It took 2 hours before arriving. When called to ask again on the cable, staff said ""yeah I already told you I will try to call the other department right?"" What kind of response is this from a service staff? Room was so-so with some constant knocking noise (staff did not inform us that there were renovations)"
"5 ⭐ hotel that doesn't serve toast 🍞 with butter or jam n even cereal with milk is totally disappointed,the swimming pool facility is ok but needs to revamp as most of the metals is rusty.the connection rooms is very nice n clean"
"Nice experience with Park Royal Pickering, clean and peaceful environment. Service is good, fast and efficient. The food is average but the restaurant environment is conducive. Pool is nice to explore, even though with limited space. Nice place to chill and relax."
"I'm amazed by the amount of greenery surrounding the hotel which compliments the garden city theme of Singapore, it feels like I'm one with nature itself.   The staff despite having to follow health protocol were still firm and friendly. Kudos to them.   Room conditions were excellent. No flaws.  Perfect for couples that want to get away from the travel ban and are nature lovers."
"Still extremely shocked by this pathetic and overpriced breakfast buffet with a ridiculously limited menu. Even had tummy upset after this.   Service was also rushed and horrendous at 7am with barely any guests arriving yet. When I asked to move my family of 4 to a larger and comfy window seat, the staff Vita just brushed aside my request by merging tables as breakfast was arriving (less work for them I reckon), leaving me a fantastic view of their black-tiled dull and barren kitchen.   And don't bother asking for a latte. You have to pay more for that. Breakfast time is restricted to 1.5hours so forget about stretching that buffet appetite. I'll be having breakfast elsewhere tomorrow instead. You can get a much better meal at the mall next door for under $6.   Don't get me"
"The entire decor of the place is so modern and artistic! I love it!  Room is clean , spacious.  It has the studio apartment feeling  to it.  Pool and gym area is the highlight. It is sheltered but the sun does come in, but it was not scorching hot when suntanning.  The laksa is so tasty! I would recommend this dish.  Jun jun  at the front desk was swift and professional. Overall, a pleasant experience."
Bought the Suite Life package and it was worth it. This is my second time getting this package. However this time round the communication was abit messy. Hope that this can be streamlined. The massage was amazing as well. Jasmine at St Gregory Spa was an incredible masseuse with strong hands.
"Went there for our birthday celebration staycay and was welcomed by the front desk(can’t remember her name) and Vita. The whole staycay was great thanks to Vita and Ridhwan as they have been assisting me the whole staycay period. They even went the extra mile to make our birthday celebration even more fun! With that, we really enjoyed our staycay and also their food was fantastic !"
The staff made sure that we were well taken care of. We felt welcomed and valued. The room that we stayed in was in great condition with a wonderful view of the city skyline.  Food served at the collection club was delicious and service was excellent. There was little waiting time. The dining area has a quiet dignity about it was guests respected the space that we shared. It was a wonderful stay and we definitely recommend families try the suites.
"Everything is find but the food is really under expectation with very less selection and the taste is under expectation. it is not worth for the buffet for dinner and breakfast, LIME team need to really look out for this"
My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Parkroyal Pickering. The room set-up was cosy and the green features were a surprising delight. Service and food was excellent throughout. We would love to stay at Parkroyal Pickering again in future.
"We thank you to Serene, Kim and chef Thye at The Club Lounge for their hospitality. We enjoyed our afternoon teas and evening cocktails there. They are really amiable and kind. Hope will see them again"
"Booked a Collection Lifestyle Junior Suite from 13 - 17 Feb 2021. Check in was a breeze. Room in perfect order, clean and bright. What stands out was the staff in Collection Club Lounge. Serene is cheerful and helpful, ensuring that guest are well taken care of in the lounge. Kimberly has perfect memory. She surprised me by remembering my food allergy. This is a 1st for all my stays across different brands of hotels. What impressed me further living testaments of the hotel motto, ""Pacific Cares"" was Chef Thye and Chef Sylvia. Chef are always the backbones of F&B. They are the unsung heroes satisfying guest with food. These 2 chefs will chip in assist the serving of food to the guests when the lounge gets a little busier. This was also a 1st for me. Usually chef remains behind in"
Really appreciate the check in time which is very efficent. Love the view and convenience to travel to the nearby shopping mall but the restaurant does not cater for muslim guest (non-halal) as we hv to travel out for breakfast.
The staff especially Ms. Kelly who is the director for rooms was extremely friendly. They helped sort out some hiccups in a very friendly manner. The service was top notch. We are very thankful for your kind gesture as healthcare providers. Thanks for making our first staycation in experience a memorable one! It was fantastic staying with you.
"Told them that we were celebrating my husband bday, but on the card they wrote happy anniversary instead. The complimentary chocs they gave attracted ants before we even touch/ open it. After providing feedback to concierge, officer simply apologised. When we were back from dinner, we noted the chocs and cake were simply disposed of (we didnt even touch them), without replacement."
"Booked a junior suite with lounge access to celebrate my birthday last year. my wife arranged for a bday decor with the hotel and was horrified to see it being left in the bag in the room as we enter the room together. For the price point we paid, I don't think we will go back again.  the Positives 1. fabulous architecture and design of the entire property. 2. interior design of the room and bathroom 3. design & placement of the facilities (swimming pool / gym) for the best view.  the Not-So-Good 1. Check-In was extremely long. (likewise for check out) 2. because of the long check-in, we missed the afternoon tea which was served. 3. my bday decor which my wife arranged for (and reminded the hotel 2 weeks, 1 week and 1 day before stay) didn't happened as her plan. She was"
Book a room to celebrate Valentine’s Day and Birthday. Check-in over the counter at 3pm was told that our room is not ready and they will provide us with a holding room our room will be ready in 1hr time.  5pm we called the operator to check on our room. Operator place us on hold and said that will check but after 15mins operator called back and doesn’t seem to understand what is going on. Hence we took the trouble to head down to reception again.  5.15pm we were attended by Junjun who than check on our room and said that our room is ready they will do a room check and bring the key card to our holding room and bring us to the new room.  6pm there’s still no sign of anyone nor calls. Called operator again and operator said that our room will only be ready by 7pm. I understand
"We are very thankful that we were greeted by excellent service staff in our stay at ParkRoyal.   From the time we checked in, we met Ibrahim at the counter. When my kids were asking qns about the hotel, he never once ignored them. In fact he was so patient and took time to answer them and even affirm their ideas.   Then when we had our meals at their lounge area, it was definitely an experience not to be missed. Good view, Good meal and Good staff! We met Chef Edmond and he took time to chat with my kids and even remembered their conversation. Next day he even surprised my son with pancakes & strawberries where my son casually mentioned it was something he liked. We were so touched by his gesture, he was not there to just do his job he went the extra mile to show his care to us."
Staying here 2 nights 3 days. Collection lounge breakfast on the 16th floor.  Serene was very nice and provided excellent service.  Food was satisfactory. The view was very magnificent of the Singapore River.
