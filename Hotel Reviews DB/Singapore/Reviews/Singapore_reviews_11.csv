"I was check in by Bella to the Great Room King which I have booked for.Check in process was fast and furiousüëç The Great King Room which I‚Äôve booked for is just nice for a couple/two person, the space is just nice! Thank you Hotel G Team for your hospitality, I will recommend it to my friends for sure!  Special thanks to the front desk staff who took after us since day one. Daryl, Hema, Howard, Yvonne and of course Bella!"
"Got a free upgrade for my stay here. Love the amenities that was provided, location was splendid as well, nearby good food places. Appreciate the staffs here, extremely friendly and super helpful, would definitely come back here again"
"Hotel G gives of a very young and fun vibe. Very suitable for young couples for a staycation. There was short queue upon my arrival, however the front desk staff were pretty efficient in clearing the queue given that it was a weekend when i checked in. I got checked in within 20min. Room size was towards the small side, but it had a warm and cosy feel. However, the pillows were a little flat, and I had stack two pillows on top of each other to sleep comfortably! Thank you Howard, Ana and bobby who assisted us and ensured that we had a comfortable stay. Will definitely recommend this hotel for a staycation!"
"hotel was very conveniently located. Booked for the good room queen. Unique design and very comfortable. Most importantly, the hotel staff were excellent. They were very willing to help and looked happy to serve. Friendly service, special shout out to Ana, Daryl and Bella who were at the counter  when I checked in. Will definitely return for another staycation with my family!!"
"Hotel G gives u the unique experience at a very affordable price. It was pleasant meeting Daryl, manager on duty who was cheerful and forthcoming. It is relaxing sitting at 25 degree , either sipping coffee or having a meal as u watch the world go by."
Booked the Good King room and room was clean and cozy. Room was complete with hair dryer and boxes of water üëçüèº Handled by Bobby and Hana and we were very happy with the attentiveness they provided. Thank you!
"Don't look further, Hotel G is the one of the best hotels to use your SRV vouchers!  1. The most basic package is $100 - you don't need to fork out cash to top up. I.e. You can spend your cash on good food.   2. The rooms are small but the service is great.  The rooms are small, about 15-17 sqm, but I don't feel suffocated. The same can't be said for bigger rooms I stayed in other hotels in SG and overseas. The rooms are nicely and uniquely designed, unlike many business hotels with generic rooms. The mattress they use is serta, so it's very nice to sleep on. Though the pillow can be a tad tough and flat. Also, the air con's temperature and wind speed are adjustable, hooray!   Note: if you have a big luggage, it can be a bit squeezy. However, this is a mote point since we are"
"I book Good Room Single to experience how.  I booked thru its hotel official website ,and get email with attractive offers. I was surprised to see that biggest room was offered to me at the price of $90 . This room was not included in the list of room available for booking for the day.  However, I decided to skip all the F&B offers , like Burger in Bed,  and other tempting snacks like "" chicken wings, ice cream tubes' because I need to watch my diet.  On the day of check in, check in was effortless and no complimentary check out was offered.  Went to 8 storey and check in single room.  Again, Hotel G is good at applying common sense in maximising the space of work desk.  kettle, cup, and container of coffee/ tea was placed on the wall holder. Very good! it create bigger place"
"Using SRV to redeem a good deal at Hotel G, check in was fast and smooth. Surprised with room decor upon entering. Little small touches from the hotel that make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. Room is small but cosy and clean. Deal comes with $50 Ginette restaurant which is worth. Thanks to Howard and Bobby who made our stay enjoyable. Highly recommended."
"Initially booked the Good Queen room for a 3D2N stay with my partner for our anniversary celebration. But after the 3D2N, we love the location of the hotel and the amenities, and then we decided to extend our stay for an additional night. Upon that extension, Daryl actually gave us a complimentary upgrade to the Great King room. Both my partner and I were shocked but happy at the same time.  I strongly recommend Hotel G as its location is very convenient to almost everywhere. It's food is commendable as well. Last but not least, their staff are very friendly and approachable which includes both Daryl and Bella."
"Booked the good queen room for 2 night stay through Traveloka, check in timing was allocated to us via email (4pm-5pm). We had to queue for 15-20 mins to check in as it was a public holiday. However, the process was fast and fuss free.  The room was small yet cosy and clean! Bed was really soft too. Location of the hotel was near to multiple MRT stations, nearest 24/7 convenient store is located only at bugis+ even though there was multiple 7-11 across the street that only open till night.   We also decided to extend our stay for 1 more night in the same room category; checked out then check in again.   Great hospitality and service by Daryl, the duty manager. He was efficient and polite throughout the entire process, also exceeded our expectation by upgrading us to a good king"
"Howard, Daryl & Bella were very hospitable. They went all out to make our stay enjoyable. The hotel was clean and the room-feel was great. There were dining vouchers which handy as we used then at Ginnett restaurant. Overall, very pleased with the stay!"
"Staffs Daren and Bella were very helpful when serving my boyfriend and I whenever we had enquires about the room. They would strike up conversations about our stay and how they could improve better, once the feedback was given, immediate action was taken to ensure that we had a pleasant stay at our room.   However, the bathroom lights were tripping most of the time and even after servicing the lights, it still went out the next day."
"Did a staycaytion using the rediscover voucher and it was very worth it!! Stay came with breakfast for 2 (set menu) and also $50 nett dining credits!! The room was relatively spacious and clean for the money we paid, and basic amenities were in the room too! Just note that there's no fridge though..   Special shout out to Yvonne who aided us in our check in and made the process very smooth! We would also like to thank Daryl and Bella as well for always greeting us warmly and made us feel at home whenever we approached them at the front office.  Would definitely recommend coming to stay at the hotel, and I would be back for another staycay! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°"
"The location is perfect as well as it's right by the center of town. Next to a museum and art school, 10mins walk from the shopping and entertainment district, a cinema, library, etc. Also near to MRT station (downtown line)."
"I had an amazing stay at the hotel. Special thanks to Howard and Bobby who have always ensure we have comfortable stay throughout the entire stay. We felt very welcome from the moment entering hotel, and Daryl who assisted us with the check in. Thank you!"
"Had a great stay experience at Hotel G! The location of the hotel is great as its surrounded by major MRT line like Bencoolen, Rochor and Bugis. There's many food options around the hotel as well.   Warm greeting by Howard once we stepped into the hotel lobby and he offered us umbrella as its raining. Check-in process assisted by Daryl was smooth, quick and professional. Bobby at reception was so helpful and patience to assist our questions and enquires.  The room interior design are cosy makes us feel comfortable even the room size is a bit small.   Make a reservation earlier if you wish to dine in at Ginett as they are always fully book. Also, do not miss out their 1 for 1 deals for beers and sides from 3pm-7pm at 25 Degrees Burger, Wine & Liquor Bar as well!   For the price"
Very compact room and comfortable bed to sleep. Location is so convinient. I love the turkish food just nearby the hotel. Entrance staff at the main entrance near the restaurant is so friendly. Check in is fast too.
Check in was smooth even at 6pm. Room is great sized. What made things great is the cleanliness. Fast express checkout. Nothing seems to be a missed. We like it! Thank you Bobby for the warm welcome! :)
"Thoroughly impressed with the professional customer service provided by Daryl from check-in service to providing ice to the room personally. Even with the long snaking queue at check-in, Daryl went above and beyond, maintaining a professional attitude. Would totally come back here again for the service provided! Rooms were clean and comfortable. Once again, customer service has exceeded expectations, even better than some of the 5-star hotels in Singapore."
"Always a great choice for a staycation. Second time here and still very happy with the professional and swift help. Special mentions to Daryl, Shaun and Bobby for the awesome service and for getting the room ready for us in such short notice."
"Really enjoy the comfortable vibes of the hotel and staff here. Very friendly and caring staff; second time here and not disappointed one bit! Big shout out to Daryl, Shawn and Bobby! Awesome service guys!"
"Tbh I don‚Äôt find the room too small as I‚Äôve stayed in smaller. It‚Äôs OK for SG standards, where space is priced at a premium. The room is cleverly designed to maximize space while allowing you to feel cozy without feeling too claustrophobic. There‚Äôs space under the bed for luggage, and enough room for a small table for working travellers. Rooms feel quite well-maintained. Checkin and out was fast and efficient. And there‚Äôs so many food options in the area. Would stay at again!"
I am not so fussy when commenting. I like G hotel overall. Good customer service during check-in and the receptionist is good and helpful. Very comfortable and clean hotel.   Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!
"I will stay in Singapore for several days then go to the United States. I have a very good impression of Singapore and very efficient clerks, government officials and good drivers and hotel steps. A nice trip."
enjoyed my stay. good location. helpful reception staff. Bobby assisted me with directions around the hotel.  will want to come back again. very beautiful country.  will recommend my family to stay here
Very good stay love the ambience service was quick as well. There are good food nearby. Was upgraded to a Good Room King too. Friendly staff was there to help at   possible when there was an issue......................
"Its myy first time here and i love the interior..  superb !! Bella was so helpful and patience w me .. after many months of not having staycation. Todayy i had my 1st staycayy w my fiance and i tend to be abit lost and clumsy but it wass all in place w the help of the team . I love the concept of the room.  Ecspeciallyy the pinboard.  It looks cool..  Basicallyy i love everything!!! And Bella , thankyou for service. Thumbs up to you ! I will prollyy come back again ! Kudos team !"
"Had a great stay experience with my friends at Hotel G! üòä Despite my immobility, the staff paid extra attention to me during my stay by checking on me. The staffs were very friendly & hospitable! Special thanks to Daryl, Ana, Hema & Yvonne for taking care of me & my friends. Would definitely revisit !"
"Had a great time with my friends at Hotel G, staff are friendly and patient. Would like to thank Daryl, Ana, Hema and Yvonne for making our stay a memorable one and being so accommodating with our requests! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Good service, fast housekeeping, concierge staff was very helpful!  Complimentary parking, champagne & 2 free burgers per room during the stay which was nice!  Gave a complimentary upgrade since we wanted side by side 2 rooms  Overall would recommend, 10/10 service! :-)"
"We had our 26th Anniversary staycation here. Hotel is clean, friendly and helpful staffsüòç. Well done Daryl and Shawnüëçüëèüëèüëè The Wagyu beef at Ginett Restaurant was so goodüòã We'll definitely come back again üòç"
"The good: Very warm hospitality, & not to mention the awesome food at Ginett. All worth the money & time spent!  The less good: the pillows are like prata, way too flat! Also, they ought to raise a ledge in the bathroom to separate the shower area, otherwise water flows out to the toilet area. Lastly, windows are very dirty!"
"Had a great stay. From the lobby all the way to the reception and the staff around are so friendly, welcoming and nice.  Rooms are super comfortable, the bed especially. Had a much needed good sleep the whole stay and the breakfast was really good too.   Thank you so much for the much needed rest and the nice friendly voices."
"Booked 3 rooms in total for my birthday, parent's anniversary and my 2 sisters for staycay. We were greeted and checked-in by Ana and Fathin. We had requested something special for my parent's room, and they prepared rose petals and towel swans. They were perfect. Was told that Shawn was the one who prepared it. The rooms were clean and looked so instagram-able. The layout is simple yet has a hint of elegance. We had a pleasant night with comfy mattress and sheets. At check-out, Daryl attended to us. He ensured we had a great stay, which we did."
"Will hotel G was quite an experience, first let's talk about the good things.  A) Amazing location - the hotel is very close to the bencooleen MRT station, it's also connected by bugis and rochor, so it's super central to everything.   B) everything is in the vicinity - you have a 24 hr thai restaurant under the hotel, you have the hotel's burger joint and a fancy restaurant called ginett under the hotel, there are about eight 7/11s and 2 fair price supermarkets close by. You have several vending machines and you can walk it down bencooleen for a late night drink... You also have Gokul which is an Indian restaurant across the street.   C) you have bella as an attentive amazing and super help at the hotel... She leads the front office and she is the nicest person ever - always"
"I waited for more than 1.5 hours for living. It is so interesting that the hotel always told me that there is a room for me but I cannot live. During the 1.5 hours, the hotel only give me a cup of water."
"Great promotions on Hustle & Grind, now I can work peacefully without the noise of my little ones. The hotel is so cozy, clean and comfortable. Love the food and I just had snacks yet and look forward to my lunch, afternoon snack and wine...  If you are having important meetings, events and a need to have a refreshing change of environment. This is a perfect place to work from hotel. Very innovative way to continue to serve others.  I like how they made Social distancing marks so fun and creative  Most importantly for an ex-hotelier and business owner like me, Amazing service, I feel like I am home :-)"
"Love the ambience and the atmosphere of the room despite its room's small size. Cos it's at Bencoolen MRT station, easy to go Bugis, Boat Quay, Orchard. Shout out to the reception lady, Ana. A very friendly personnel, gave us free upgrade from queen to king bed."
"Perfect location for a staycay! You would be spoilt for choice with the variety of food nearby. Or if you're feeling lazy, the burger bar and restaurant downstairs are great options as well. Do yourself a favor and plan your next vacation in this hotel! I promise you would not regret it (:"
"Bella at the reception is extremely cooperative and such a joy to served by! Knowing it is a surprise birthday celebration, she played along with the surprise while checking in for the birthday girl and also gave us complimentary welcome drinks!:) Overall very amazing experience staying in Hotel G and would HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
"Room size is fit for solo traveler The room is clean and cozy, quite comfy as well I love the room decoration, so nice  Not so expensive and quite valuable in Singapore!!! Would possibly stay again next time!!! Highly recommend"
"I‚Äôm not one to write reviews but my stay at Hotel G deserves this exception. Our stay on the 16/2/2021 really went beyond our expectations.   From the very minute we stepped into the lobby, we were constantly greeted with a smile, which really just brings that warm feeling back , especially in this covid-19 climate.  Throughout our stay, Daryl took the initiative to personalise our stay, ensuring all our needs and wants were met!  Hotel G, as simple as the name sound is well on its way to being a top notch flagship in the hospitality industry, with its well trained staff, modern furnished look and attractive marketing.  Kudos to the HR team For maintaining and training up their staff!   We will definitely come back to Hotel G and would recommend our friends to this hotel as well!"
"Great hospitality, simple room yet cosy and very clean. Definitely will recommend.. Thank you Daryl for your great hospitality! Look for Daryl should u need anything!! Your warmth and great disposition made my day stay with hubby memorable. Thank you!!"
It‚Äôs my second time back in this hotel. Amazingly clean and comfortable. Tho it‚Äôs 45 mins waiting time for check in. Faithin was so good at what she was doing and gave her best service. Thank you so much!
"Recently went to try Hotel G and it was amazing. When i got there i was served by bella and she was fast, friendly and helpful. She made sure i didnt wait long for check in as i was with my child. When i went into the room, the room was in very good condition. I would definitely stay here agin and recommend it to others."
"Stayed here for a staycation and found the place to be nice, clean and cosy room, great service. Value for money. Great restaurant and food options around. Rooms are a little on the small side but I enjoy the cosiness."
"Celebrated my anniversary here and Elvis and Nana were really amazing from the pre-arrival all the way to the check in.   I wanted to arrange something for my partner prior to check in, and was offered a celebration package by Elvis. Nana then took over after a while, and spelt my name correctly (very important to me) after her other front desk colleague spelt my name wrongly. Nana was very personable and let me know everything I needed to know during check in. When I reached the room, I was pleasantly surprised to receive a courtesy call from her too.   We were upgraded to the great room and the atmosphere in the room was beautiful! The celebration package Elvis offered comes with decorations and a $50 ginett voucher. (Ps. I moved away the celebration box because I placed my"
"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Hotel G, which is situated near Bugis Junction. Room is clean and amenities are provided. Would also like to thank Riza for being so helpful! Would definitely recommend Hotel G to anyone whose looking for a nice staycation."
Hema was helpful and nice when a booking error was made. She advised what steps to take and promptly corrected the dates of the stay! She also further upgraded our stay to made the stay more memorable.
"I purchased a Work from Hotel package with overnight stay recently, having stayed there for a staycation before and enjoyed it. However, the experience this time was not so enjoyable. The plusses were that the front staff were courteous and professional during check in, the hotel itself was quiet with strong wifi for working, and the breakfast was very filling and delicious. However, not all the perks listed on the package were given, such as the morning and midday snacks. The fresh juices were nice, though.  I encountered very mixed service at Ginett  restaurant where I tried to use the lunch and drink voucher given as part of the package. The front manager was polite and reminded me to check in with the TraceTogether App, and I had enjoyed the food. Yet... I had asked for the"
"Always love staying at Hotel G - it's a wonderful boutique hotel with many unique quirks and hidden gems around the area. Room is clean and smells great, staff are always friendly and helpful.   For late night owls, there's a open air Thai restaurant just downstairs of the hotel , and Wan Wan Thai Cafe serving bingsu desserts till 3am everyday! It's also near shopping areas like Bugis and Dhoby Ghuat. A secret tip - there's a game at the lift where if you spot the differences, you get a free wine from the bar downstairs ;) I would definitely come back to stay again with Hotel G!"
"Second time staying here, always very intrigued by the giant dream catcher in the room. However, the dream catcher in my room this time was a bit uglier and plainer than the first (the first had feathers).   Room wise, it‚Äôs an affordable stay hence room size is small. It‚Äôs still manageable even though the bed is fitted tightly at the corner which means one of the guests would have a hard time going to the toilet in the middle of the night.  Service wise, we had a warm welcome by manager Darryl, a much kinder greeting than our first stay. He allowed us early check in, likely since it was a Friday so there might have more available rooms. Late check out of 30 mins extra (12.30pm) was also given when request was made. Quite impressed as this hotel was willing to accommodate when"
my hubby loves the big ceiling shower & the ceiling dream catcher.. very nice design! I shall give a 5 stars for the overall of the room!  Good King Bed is very comfy that i almost fell asleep & facilities wise are are overall excellent as well. it will be prefect if there's a mini fridge for us to chill our drink as today is a humid weather..  Love the location as it's just next to Sunshine Plaza where my hubby can go to his favorite Gundam Store.. And i can easily access to the Guan Yin temple jus a few mins walk away.. there's a very nice thai restaurant below the hotel building. (:
"I received warm welcome from Front Office Manager, Daryl.  The front office team was friendly and bubbly.  When I got into the room, within minutes, I received a call from the front office to check if everything is fine.  The food at the restaurants were nice and hotel guests are given 15% discount for dining in. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a nice staycation."
Positive Hotel is clean and comfy. Good stay overall.  Negative Poor communication between staff at reception. Extended late checkout timing but probably wasnt convey between staff and came calling and knocking to verify check out timing.
"Had a really delightful stay at the greater king room with outdoors this weekend. Daryl, Fathin and Hema were really hospitable and welcoming. The room was clean and big, and thankfully there was no rain that day so we managed to utilize most of the outdoors. The only downside is that the indoor TV only allows for android devices to connect."
We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived early just to drop off our bags and were told that we could check in ahead of schedule. Special shout out to Daryl at the front counter for arranging this. He was very helpful and professional and gave us a very good first impression of the hotel. We really love the unique decor that gave the hotel a lot of personality. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Thank you Hotel G for a memorable stay!
"Stayed a night at G Hotel on a Saturday. Was greeted and served by Bella. Genuine and professional, she clarified my doubts with ease and made me feel very welcomed to the Hotel. Check-in was smooth, quick and easy. Even got a free upgrade to the king size bed room.  Room is small but it is cozy and clean. TV channels were limited but it has an HDMI input to stream your laptop or other devices. Hotel location is convenient with many food outlets available in the vicinity. Only downside to the room is that there is no mini bar fridge.   Overall, very happy with my stay. For the price point it highly exceeded my expectations. Will definitely visit again!"
Bought the package through klook for christmas with a decent price. Design of hotel is very modern and very accessible to amenities and food places. Had a pleasant stay with great service as their staffs are very friendly and accommodating. Patience in responding to our request are what the makes the stay very pleasant.
"The greater room exceeded my expectations in all aspects! Room comes with a super cool balcony great for chilling! Service is fast too when requesting for ice, towels, bottle openers! Great value 10/10"
Great hotel. With great cleanliness and overall set up. Space and atmosphere was cosy. Amenities provided were more than sufficient.  Front desk service was very friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make things more comfortable.
"The receptionist, Bella, did a great job serving me! Good first impression, looks neat. will definitely stay here again! Walking distance from Bugis, easy access. Price is reasonable and room is tidy, clean and chic!"
"Big shoutout to Ana for handling my check-in swift and hassle freeÔºÅ  And thanks Ana and Daryl for the handwritten note!   The min I step into the hotel, I feel welcomed by the staffs.  The rooms is pretty spacious given that the space is limited. It was a quiet space and allows me to work in the morning/evening.  The hotel have a few restaurant downstairs and is pretty close to train station.  I highly recommend you to come and stay with G Hotel regardless of solo, with friends or family.  Its a great experience!"
Went in for a long awaited staycation and was greeted by Bella. Her bubbly self and vibrant personality made it easier for us to communicate and had fun during the check in process. She also accommodated when I requested for a late check out till 3pm without charge!! Thank you for the great experience Bella! You definitely left an imprint in Hotel G ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Friendly staff Bella & Fathin.  Central to popular singapore attraction. Some walking distance and for others.  MRT is close by and bus stops are nearby as well.   Room clean and modern.  Price is very reasonable for this location.
"Stayed at Hotel G again recently and I must say that the overall experience was an excellent one.  Duty manager, Daryl Goh attended to us at check-in was approachable and friendly in demeanour. He was knowledgeable, meticulous and systemic in the check-in process and safety checks. The expedient and systemic check-in process facilitated concurrency of activities and minimised waiting time for guests, and the build-up of any queue at all.   Not the first time a staying at Hotel G and I must say Hotel G‚Äôs rooms are consistently clean and well maintained. Staff are proactive and helpful, and it‚Äôs always a comfortable experience!   p.s. Do book with the current burgers in bed promo which is amazing!"
"This is my Nth time visiting Hotel G and since day 1, i always have pleasant experience here. Unlike my other staycations here in Singapore, i do not have to deal with issues on cleanliness, service and thoughtfulness of the staff. Being particular about cleanliness, i always do a check on hotel room‚Äôs cleanliness by wiping down surfaces with strong disinfectant wipes. Of the multiple visits here in Hotel G, i found my wet wipes remain unstained. Kudos for the consistency.   Good Crowd management, customer service experience and thoughtfulness of the staff can be felt from the entrance to the concierge; even along the corridor when i bump into the staffs. During this stay, Daryl the duty manager check us in within a short span of time and ensured our stay was comfortable and"
"I love the hotel. had a one night stay here and I've got to say, im impressed with hotel G. the ambience, room deco and friendly staffs are fantastic! I would like to highlight abt daryl as he assisted me with my check in and accommodated to my needs. thanks daryl! & thanks hotel G :) would love to stay here again (:"
Its a really pretty dreamcatcher on the ceiling that made me drawn to this room and the hotel aesthetic is on point and first impression does not look dodgy at all :) i love how they make use of every space and inch of the room to maximize hotel occupancy rate! Good job in designing
We had a wonderful stay with Hotel G.   Special mention to front desk managers Daryl and Bella. Praiseworthy services from both of them and the rest of the hotel staffs.  Dinning at in-house restuarant Ginett was excellent as well.  We will be back.
"Daryl & Bella who attended us during check in and check out is so friendly, make us feels so good celebrating our 5 years anniversary. The voucher we got we purchase the desserts menu from Ginett Restaurant and my godness is so delicious!! Will come back for the hospitality and excellent dessert! Thank you!"
"The room is so compact, it's a tight squeeze for 2 adults. You have to literally climb onto the bed to plonk yourself into the other side. The wash basin is just outside the shower and toilet. There's no wardrobe, just an open hanger with 4 hangers to hang your clothes. A kettle with complimentary coffee/tea bags on a tiny desktop leaves no space to place your personal accessories like phones, jewellery, etc.  Breakfast is the standard western fare or chicken congee, with a cup of cut fruits and croissants. Service is efficient, though you have to ask for butter if you want it with your croissants.  Hotel G is a conveniently located near to MRT stations Rochor/Bencoolen. It's just opposite Fortune Centre and Sunshine Plaza, so food options are aplenty."
"My first time staying in Hotel G and it was amazing! its an affordable hotel and the service was beyond expectation. Even though the room was small, it felt very cosy due to the decorations and the ambience of the room. The good Queen room can accommodate not more than 2 people.  Don't expect much as this is not a 5 star hotel.   The front desk officer name Bella was very calm in handling guests. Especially it was the peak time for check in. Also, it was on a new year and they were full house so we had to wait for our rooms to be ready for check in. Understood that they try their level best to accommodate to their guests.  Waited for about 1.5 hours to finally check in. We were tired from walking around and it was raining heavily, so we were glad that there was someone to assist"
"Though the room is small, it is clean and the decorations are nice. Wifi is good. Free parking is also available. Lots of food options are available nearby. Customer service is not bad. Good for a short staycation at affordable price."
"We would like to show our compliments to the staff who handled us meticulously, Daryl. He helped us with process of checking-in efficiently and handled our queries professionally. He is truly an asset to the organisation. We can feel his sincerity, genuineness as we observe him handling other customers with the same care. Truly amazing. My boyfriend and myself come from the service-line, we know how difficult situation can be, especially now. Thank you for serving everyone, and going the extra mile for your guest. We are very pleased and would return definitely."
It‚Äôs a really clean and comfortable stay at Hotel G. I would specially like to mention Shawn from the Front Office for helping us expedite the check-in processes and also Housekeeping Shah for efficiently attending to our late night request for miscellaneous items such as more towels and water. Overall it‚Äôs a really pleasant stay and we would definitely visit again!  Chong
"I am very impressed the whole hotel was designed and highly praised the service quality of each staff during this tough times. They were very professional and worked hard to ensure each guest has a pleasant and enjoyable stay,  They were truly friendly and helpful. They smiled and greeted guests with their hearts and ready to provide a helping hand.  The room and location of the hotel was excellent. Love it. Kudos to all staff."
"The stay was short but enjoyable. Check-in was smooth & fast. The gentleman who attended to me was friendly & attentive.  Room was pleasant & the design was slick as well as modern.   The only issue is the cleanliness of the aircon vents. Quite dusty.  Toilet was clean.   Simply love the location and few minutes walk to Bugis Plus.    Upon returning to the hotel, the friendly hotel staff attending to our temperature & safe entry checks.   Please note that the laundry and slipper bags are charged at a nominal fee. Would suggest to provide another alternative option if guests were to do their own laundry back home (i.e. paper bags for laundry if environment friendly option is a concern to do plastic bags).   Check out was fast as I did Express Check out. The hotel should consider"
"Staycation gone wrong. Rooms are not soundproof. If you have neighbours beside u in the next room, u can practically hear their talking and laughing.  Ceilings also has this creaking contracting sound at night. Could be due to the wood or tiles. If some1 is staying above u , u can practically hear the chair shift n their heavy steps.  As much as we try to keep it simple & enjoy this staycation, we were rudely awoken at 12.30am till 1.30am by the next door neighbours grp of 4 giggling, laughing, incessant chatting till we couldn't take it and called concierge.   Security guard found there were 4 ppl in the room instead of registered 2 person. Makes u wonder how lax security is. I went over to tell them off as the security does not seem to impose any authority. Disappointing to"
"I was there with my bestie for a work-cation on a Friday. Room was small but cosy. They provided us 2 plates of pastries for morning tea (maybe cuz our room was double occupancy), lunch with a glass of wine and another plate (only 1 this time) of sandwiches & waffles for our afternoon tea break. Thankful for the fruit juices, canned drinks and water provided in the minibar, tea and coffee was also available.   Service at check in was quick and friendly.   Overall a very worth it package, we will be back! ‚úåÔ∏èüòÅ"
"Me and my family stayed here for 9 nights and we enjoyed ourselves alot. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended. We went to both restaurants to try the food and it was delicious. Once again, thanks Joyce for arranging for me."
"Location nice, staff helpful too. But the rain shower didn't work, hot water kettle had dirt, one of the glasses was dirty (dried toothpaste I think?). We booked a package with Klook, which promised a free Champagne but the champagne given was not the one stated in the package, which I would have preferred. I've attached the photo of the advertised v. actual with this post.   Still, give 3 stars because the package came with $50 dining vouchers and I really enjoyed the restaurant Ginett below, and the package was still considerably value for money. Unfortunately, the multiple minor disappointments added up and prevent me from giving any stars higher."
"Checked in: 16 Nov 2020 Checked out: 17 Nov 2020  Booked a staycation for the mentioned dates and informed the hotel we needed the wheelchair accessible room. Unfortunately, it was not available on the day we arrived. We were informed about 1 hour before we checked in.  Room was interesting except the pillow was terrible, really flat pillows.  Was thankful and appreciative of Mr Rahimi who was at the level one counter. He helped a lot with the lift. Especially since he had to"
check in on a friday. it took about 45mins to reach our turn for checkin. room was decent and extremely cosy. water refill was not allowed during covid period. so room service to deliver water to our room was available. breakfast was ok. surrounding area good for shopping and eating.. near dhoby area. walkable distance.
"Checked in on 19 Dec 2020. Took a shower and decided to take a nap. However there was a musty smell coming from the bed. We thought that it was from the duvet and requested to change the cover. The cover was changed but the smell came back. It must be the duvet then. Informed reception and they advised that housekeeping would change the whole duvet and send us some water too.  Water was sent to us but the other request was not passed to the housekeeping. Explained to the housekeeping staff and she brought us a new duvet. We must compliment the housekeeping staff as she was really courteous and nice throughout the entire ordeal.  With the new duvet, we thought our worries were all resolved. Alas, a few minutes later, the smell was back. This time round, we decided to sniff for"
"Normally I would not book hotels through Klook but I did so to utilise the Singapore Rediscover voucher.   The hotel is actually quite small but it has a hipster theme. (Reminds me of the Papa Wale hotel in Taipei)  For the price I paid, its value for money for Singapore standards. Nice and clean but its a tiny room. If you pay slightly more, you can opt for M Social on Klook and get a bigger room.   Pros: Nice and clean but really no facilities in the hotel. Eateries near hotel and Bugis is a 5 min walk. The service staff was prompt in her emails, etc. Excellent service overall...  Cons. The sink in the room is tiny, the pillows need to be thicker, the carpark entrance confusing."
Everything was good and fast check-in although I have difficulty communicating due to masking that I couldn't see their lip-reading instead of showing them via mobile texting. I would like to appreciate Belle's customer service to take initiative by leading me to my hotel room. The room is just right for solo or couple to settle down and everything is clean especially the toilet which I'm concerned about the most. Well Done... I will definitely stay here again in the future.
"Was very impressed during the checkin especially with Ana, she was very polite, friendly and quick! Raven from Ginett restaurant was great as well too, she was calm and composed even though the restaurant was swamped. The room I was in was quite small so I‚Äôd advise claustrophobic people to take note of this. However it‚Äôs a great deal with its price and location with good eats around the area."
"ants crawled onto bed and there were a lot on the table that got onto my stuff. also had a couple flies in the room which isn‚Äôt the most pleasant. other than that, service is great, reception is very helpful and room cleaning service is excellent (replaced water and toiletries). room is a little small but good for couples or small groups. bed is big and very comfortable"
"The location of the hotel is a few minutes walk away from the MRT station. The stay was pleasant as the service was good.  Requested for a change in the room as the wind was hitting onto the external facade too loudly, and the reception immediately helped us with it.  Breakfast served at the 25 Degrees cafe was awesome as well. The waitress by the name Abigaile was really helpful and friendly towards us.  Overall, an awesome experience!"
"Great location in the city/town area where there‚Äôs abundance of food available. Greeted with excellent service by Daryl Lim at the front desk when I arrived. He was very quick with our administration.   However a little disappointed on the room size, it was not as spacious as it was shown in the picture. There wasn‚Äôt much TV channel available as well.   Do note that there‚Äôs only 1 complimentary parking for an exit so I do not advise you to drive there as parking is pretty expensive. $1/30 mins for weekdays and weekends. It would be great if Hotel G is able to look into this."

"The room was clean and nice, everyone was very friendly and helpful. The hotel also has bar and burger place. The Front Office staff Daryl did a great job - very friendly and polite! What a great experience!"
