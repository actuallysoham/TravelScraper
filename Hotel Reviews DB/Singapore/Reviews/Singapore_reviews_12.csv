"We booked a 2 night staycation for my fiance’s birthday, Kana at the front desk was really friendly and sweet, giving us free room upgrades and arranged for a birthday cake. She also helped with our late check out as well, along with Jolie and we’re really appreciative.   The hotel is really clean and the bed is comfortable, the towels smell nice and any room services were quick and prompt.   All staff were really friendly and helpful. Shirley (i forgot her department) helped us with the pool booking even though it was not in her department scope.   Thank you for the amazing experience Mandarin Orchard!"
"Check-in was fast and in order. Swimming pool till 7pm and 24 Hrs Gym need to book slot inadvance. Room with comfortable lighting and aircon is cold enough, clean and comfy. Restroom is clean and spacious. Location is surrounded by Shopping mall and lots of restaurant/cafe to choose from. Definately a recommend Hotel to stay around Orchard area. Up to 5 paxs."
"Check in is fast, Overall experience is very good.  I would to thank Ms Daisy and her guest services team for their personalized and efficient service. They were very accommodating with my room move from Orchard Wing to Main Wing. I really appreciate it. I am impressed with the Main Wing where the room is very spacious and modern and they prepared a surprise for my anniversary!  I had my dinner at Triple Three. Special mention to Mr Nicholas, Chef William and his team for their remarkable service. The food prepared was delicious.   Overall, I had a great stay with my fiancée in this hotel and can't wait to come back again!!!"
So during pandemic we of course are barred from travelling. So we had a staycation. Wow ! Talk about singpore service culture at mandarin orchard. Best out of all my overseas hotels! They took care of u from booking to reminding to the relaxing ambience while checking in all the way to their tv entertainment system and checking out process. Their guards are also cheerful.. will be booking it again for my son's birthday
Check in is fast at noon.  Overall experience is good.  Hotel surprise us with bed decorations plus a complimentary cake for our anniversaries.  The in room dining food is awesome with 30% discount for in house guests.  The breakfast is very limited to choice provided.
Check on the 30/03/2021 till 31/03/2021 room 1040. Checkin is located at level 5 the rooms are spacious and very clean. Upon check-in we been served by a Japanese lady name Kana at the reception a very friendly lady and been given a complimentary late checkout at 1 without even asking. We met up with the Night Duty Manager name Linda she is very helpful on some of our enquires. Upon checkout the Duty Manager name Janice greeted us to bid us farewell.   I would like to say a big thank you on the name’s that i mentioned. Thanks for the wonderful hospitality.
"The daycation package is quite affordable given the location and hotel calibre. I accidentally double booked because there was an issue with the payment but the staff kindly did the refund with no fuss.   The room was well appointed and clean, and it was a great place to hang out in comfort. It would be great if there's a half-daycation package because it beats sitting in a cafe."
"Have a great celebration here, feel so good , the cake was nice to eat, breakfast too!the wantan mee was best hahaha~ we got the premier room…room was so big and the toilet too~ neat and clean~  but very sad for the swimming pool timing, what we booked the timing kena heavy rain with thunder, we cant go, when rebook ady full, then we book for next day, but full also, the reception said they will call us if got any cancel slot, at last we dint go for swimming pool at all, haiz"
"The check-in was a smooth process thanks to Dian's great service! The room was beautiful, and we will definitely come back again. The location is also very convenient for shopping and great food. Thank you Dian once again for your great service :)"
"First impressions, the check-in queue was really long. At one point in time there were 35 people in the queue. While there were 8 check-in counters, I waited about 25 to 30 minutes in line. I do appreciate the service staff who were doing their best to manage the crowd.   I was upgraded from a Deluxe Room to a Premier Room which is much more spacious but does not have the bathtub. The room looks nice, with a good view of the Orchard area, and also MBS. Toiletries including toothbrush and shower caps are also provided. The Wi-Fi here is pretty fast, with download speeds at 85Mbps and upload speeds at 21Mbps. Next to the work table, there is also a HDMI port which you can plug your laptop to watch shows on Netflix. Otherwise, there's a large variety of cable channels. The mattress"
"During this covid pandemic, I wanted to take a break after achieving a milestone in my career. I decided to do a staycation at Mandarin Orchard for one night. I was working in healthcare and was able to qualify for a special promo for a deluxe room. I wasn’t expecting a lot as the price was pretty cheap. However, to my surprise, the hotel staff who attended to me was really nice, a Japanese lady, and she upgraded me to a next tier room which was a bonus for me and even offered me slightly late checkout. I’m truly blown away by the service I received at the hotel. The check in was swift and easy, the check out was automatic, by dropping keys in a express check out box. And the room was impressive, very clean and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay! Highly recommended for anyone looking"
its been a joyful lunch banquet event with small group of families and friends.  overall a happy experience and the room provide to us  with nice breakfast too. thanks to the staff and manager for making it memoriable day.
"Overall staycation is good and my two kids kind of like it,especially the bathtub can accommodate two small kids.Only the swimming pool is small.Morning breakfast is good and there is a power trip on that morning around 0715 hrs for about 15 minutes. Will visit again."
"I have made my booking through e-mail and indicated several times that I would like a high floor corner room. However, I was given a room at level 13 upon check in. Even after showing print-out of my booking correspondences on this, they can only give a me a room at level 15 that is further away from the lift (not corner room) out of 37 floors. Really disappointing. Wanted to support them after the Covid cluster breakout by booking immediately after they reopen, but didn't receive the appreciation from them."
Had an excellent stay at Mandarin Orchard this weekend. The service was exceptional and the location was perfect for a weekend in Orchard Road. Thank you Elvie and team! Perfect place for a staycation
"Complimentary upgrade to a club room and a nice little cake were given as gifts to one of our birthday. Excellence service, hygiene and location. Enjoyed our stay and will consider to come back again."
"My husband and i had a great time at mandarin orchard!  no regrets choosing MO as our preferred hotel to hold our wedding lunch. food and service were top notch! Jacqueline was our hotel manager and she was very helpful throughout our whole wedding journey , we are really happy to have the chance to work with her and the floor manager Eugene. Both of them were very professional. highly recommended!"
"2nd visit as we had a corporate promo. Our first visit was a month ago where the experience wasn't that great.   This time, the check in queue was long but it was more organised. They only allowed one person of the party to join the queue and opened up a waiting room for all other members.  The room we got had signs of wear and tear, similar to the previous experience. But it was comfortable, especially with the many channels on the TV and a bathtub.   There was a promo for in room dining the previous time, but the promo has changed to only 30% of Chatterbox. (Previously it was 50%).   Breakfast was more organised with better tasting food this time. It seems they do action on feedback!   The location is very good and convenient. The government shut the hotel down on the day that"
"1) After check in, the TV was fine. After went out and came back, TV not working and need to call service counter and ask technician to came over and fix it.   2) Bathroom : Brown water flowing out from the tap.   (i) We call service counter, they said they will ask someone up and check.   (ii) So we wait in the room but no one came and phone rang. So i pick up and they said will arrange another room for us which is lower level as this issue was only encounter on high floor which not only us affected. So i ask her back, does that mean lower level confirm wont have this issue and she reply yes and ask us to give them 10 min and will return us a call because they need to check any available room.   (iii) We waited for 10min and no call return and wondering why they check 1"
"During my reservation , was surprise to receive a notification from Kho Jia Yi on that they will prepare a complimentary cake !  This was so sweet and thoughtful of her .   During my check in , arrive on time ... check on with Max was fast. Clear and detail explanation by Max also. Easy to understand . Was upgraded to Club floor 3021 to reduce the noise from the current minor works going on .   Another simple and thoughtful mindset by Max.   Went into the room , my wife was surprise with the cake and the lovely swan...I nearly have to sleep on the floor .. coz the swan is too lovely to destroy. Hahaha..   Thanks to the housekeeping team who make it happen .   Me and wife appreciate the nice gesture and thoughtful mindset from the hotel team who makes things happen and end nicely"
"We book our hotel through direct website for mystery room and we get an upgrade to the club room and high floor! The hotel is great interior and exterior with facilities. As we only get to use the swimming pool for an hour, we really enjoy as it was less people during the time slot that has book! It was fantastic! The room is big and spacious with amenities, bathub & the view is great too! We went for our first wedding anniversary staycation & this is really made our stay more enjoyable with swan towel decorations for us , welcome card from hotel manager, Danny Wong and they gave us a complimentary cake! The reception Dian who check us in is friendly and great! Thank you for making our stay memorable and pleasant 😍😍😍😍"
"We choose the hotel for me and wifey ROM stayaction. After knowing that we are having our ROM stay, they help us upgrade as there is available room, they even given us a cake with congratulation on it. Totally love it. Everyone is with a smile and the service is great. Room is very clean and staff attended to us within a few min when we requested. Will totally go back again."
"Mandarin Orchard's only strength is its staff. The Guest Services team were polite and very helpful and the Housekeeping team similarly cheery and maintained excellent cleanliness. The room was free of major defects but Mandarin Orchard's soft product was unfortunately, extremely disappointing.   For breakfast at the renowned Chatterbox, you're limited to 1 main course order per pax - which, if you go for the American breakfast is 1 egg, 2 strips of malnourished bacon, 1 slice of triangular ham that reminded me of you'd get at an Army cookhouse, 2 miniature sausages and some chili sauce. You do get free flow of fruits and bread (read: any two of a croissant, red velvet cupcake and something that very mildly resembled a Danish) coffee/tea/juice but honestly, charging $32 nett for"
"I booked the staycation last year and due to some cases of covid19 infection in this hotel, it was push till this year.  As i do not have annual leave due to change of new job, i have to choose in Feburary which happened to be my birthday.  The hotel was informed of my birthday, they upgraded my room without me asking and even prepared a nice cake upon arrival. I was surprised to receive the cake as I do not expect a whole cake. The morning breakfast was decent. The room was spacious and clean.  Overall it was a smooth stay. Checked in only takes 25minutes and check out is a breeze.   However, i would suggest to have the reception table cleaned after every guest as one of the hotel in the city was doing. Some of the guests crowded at the counter to wait  for the family member to"
"The Work from Home package gave us a feel of the hotel (just wanted to try it out).  Firstly, the booking process wasn't that great: I was not redirected to the confirmation page so I gave them a ring to check if it went through. Linda picked up and told me ""they [reservations] already went home so you ask me I also cannot do anything"". I didn't expect that from a 5-star establishment who charges $170 for half a day on an entry-level room. The check in process was awkward: it took around 15 minutes and we were the only one there. Furthermore, my partner was asked whether he had paid already, of course he has why would we have an online booking if he didn't. They nearly charged us again for the room. The room itself was nice, clean, with a spacious bathroom. It's located at a"
Room was comfortable with bathtub although view was blocked by Takashimaya building. Only drawback was going to swimming pool or gym required another key from concierge. I went all the way to 37th floor and had no key to enter to the gym.
"Summary:  This hotel stay would make a decent 2 to 3-star equivalent. If you're traveling with infant(s) or if you want the full 5-star experience, you're better off picking another hotel.  On to the Specifics: Check-in: efficient, and well-managed due to the covid situation. They are extra cautious now because of the recent transmissions in this hotel. - Insufficient chairs for the influx of check-in guests. My aged Parents had to stand, as it was overcrowded.   NOTE: the lobby is inconveniently located on level 5, so if you want to check out, swim, go to the gym, or go to concierge, you'll have to make a stop on this floor, before going to your destination.  Room: - very old, and in dire need of renovations - they cut corners doing up the room: - floor is uneven, and there are"
"Stayed at Mandarin Orchard for 2 nights in January. It was my second time staying at the property (the first was many years ago) but the first time post COVID-19.   We were granted early check-in and it was done efficiently. Service was friendly and we were upgraded to the Club Floor at the Orchard Wing. View from the room the was nice, the room itself was spacious, clean and comfortable.   I believe the hotel does need refreshing and refurbishing as the decor is rather dated. I’m not sure if there are newly renovated rooms though. The one we stayed in is definitely not one of them.   Otherwise, the overall stay was good! Breakfast at Chatterbox was rather standard, could’ve been better in my opinion. I liked that it’s very conveniently located and there are plenty of eating and"
"Check-in was seamless, did ask the receptionist of the room but to my understanding it a full house today 30/1/21, so I do not have a choice. Once settle myself in the room it was not what I thought it was, I only saw the pic of the feature first picture when i book in the their direct apps so I thought it’s worth the stay end up their superior deluxe room came with afew different room conditions so here is mine!!!!"
"Stayed on 22nd Jan and felt this hotel is worthy of a commendation. All members of hotel that I encountered are friendly and caring. This pandamic has put a dent in the morale of the hospitality industry and the kudos to the staff in upholding their service standards. Conceige did a fine job of ensuring guest safety and accomodating my request to use the pool. The room was spacious with good TV and channel selection. Housekeeping was very responsive and friendly. We had a satisfying breakfast at Chatterbox. Food was fresh, delicious and well presented. I will like to thank Alicia Tie and her colleagues for their warm hospitality.  Even though it's not the swankiest hotel in Orchard Road, the warm service will always beckon one to revisit this hotel."
Back after years to celebrate our wedding anniversary and definitely like us things changes over the years. Previously where we enter the hotel was via a driveway along Orchard Road it's now at the side next to Ngee Ann City. Check-in is on the 5th floor. Room was well appointed and with bathtub. Only complain-there is a window looking out the bathroom to the main room and each time we turn on the lights in the night everyone is awoken with the bathroom light coming through the tainted window. King bed and pillows were comfortable. Parking is redeemable at Concierge each entry/exit. Breakfast now limited to a small list due to Covid. Very friendly and approachable staff. Appreciate the hotel retaining her aged local staff and making it more homely and another attraction to stay
"I have stayed in Mandarin Orchard several times. In general, the experience has been wonderful. Great value for money. I stayed in a Club Room each time and enjoyed breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails. The food was delicious and sufficient quality for the price point. There is not much alcoholic beverages to select from during evening cocktails but was still ok. The in-room dining discount used to be 50% for stay in guests but since reduced to 35% only which was disappointing. Hope the price continues to be this reasonable... would definitely continue coming back if so!"
"We were originally supposed to have our wedding banquet elsewhere but due to various circumstances had to shift to Mandarin Orchard.   There was so little time to prepare everything and honestly my mind was a blank on the big day. I have to say the day wouldn’t have gone by so smoothly if not for the banquet team led by Royston and our wedding coordinator, Terence. We had so many good reviews about the service!!    Our stay thereafter in the executive suite was also great! We especially loved the cocktail time at the Top of the M. They were super generous with the alcohol and bites we didn’t even have the stomach to eat dinner thereafter.   The hotel is not crowded and facilities are all very empty which is GREAT because it feels like you have the hotel all to yourself.  Thank"
"It was a surprise gift from our dear friend, from miles away. The process of checking in & out was super smooth! ALL the staffs there were friendly! From receptionist, conceirge & room service. Although there was a tiny hassle from the carpark to the hotel lobby, but it's understandable due to the safety precaution measurements. They even met with our friend's requirement & gave us a delicious cake! The pool was not what we expected (abit small) but rest assured, it is clean! The room & toilet was clean as well! Only downfall if they provide trash bag for the trash bin & if the toilet could have bidet spray, it would be great!  Overall, we had an amazing stay! Thank you for the warmest welcome & amazing experience!"
"Booked a staycation 15-18Jan at Premier Meritus Club room  after recommended by my niece. Despite hotel being dated however me and my partner thorough enjoyed especially the tea hour 3-5pm and canapés hour 6-8pm which one can relax on the 39th floor Top of the M with a awesome view. Daily Menu may be the same but again which hotel don practices that? You can even get away from those kids for a while. Even our last Dec 5star property in Marina Square, breakfast choice don even change a bit on our 4 days stay and mind you the room rates don even come cheap. That’s what staycation all about is to relax and enjoy and something memorable after your stay. Do yourself a favour, splurge a little to pamper especially during this downtime don even know when is it going to be over. Infact"
"December staycation!  Location : of course one of the winning factor as it is situated in the middle of orchard road. Walking distance to many shopping malls. Traffic though can be a nuinsance. Eg : drop off and pick up. Getting a cab.   Lobby : A long line to check in but it wasnt that bad. The queue was moving. We were given a bottle of water. There were hotel staffs walking ard talking and explaining and letting us know whats happening.   Front office : Check in process was quite fast though we had to wait for our room but were given free coffee at the cafe. Check in staff was friendly and accomodative.  Room : A little dusty but still bearable else we wld have ask for a room change ( allergies ), but room was clean. Bed was ok. Pillow was ok. Toilet was ok. Typically a"
"I'm back again for another long stay, and extended my stay. Covid-19 put everyone on staycation to re-experience Singapore. From front desk, lounge, housekeep to kitchen, the Mandarin team has displayed the best of the best. Nothing was compromised in the hotel today when you compare them to the good times before covid. In fact, more care had been taken to protect not only the guests, but their staff as well. I have never felt safer anywhere than Mandarin Orchard. This is a hotel that takes responsibilities seriously. My deepest gratitude to the team: Chef William, Chef Elvin, Elvie, Elinna, Jaini, Sani, Jimmy, Aurelius, Ivy, Syaza, Jolie, Donovan, Mr Jaya, Mommy Doreen, Kana, the housekeep team for guest rooms and lounge, led by Ms Hazelina. I am coming back for 2021 Chinese"
"Enjoyed my staycation and the staff was very attentive to my requests. From checkin to checkout , to breakfast , the service was impeccable. :) I was there celebrating my sister's belated birthday and it was a great that they decorated the room and a cake was presented to her. You made her very happy."
"My favourite staycation. From the top notch service, giving us free upgrade with surprise deco and Choco for our wedding anniversary. It's one indeed best memorable moment for us. Thank you Orchard Mandarin for making our stay luxurious and pleasure. ❤️ A must staycation of all places."
It was a comfortable quarantine with my daughter.. food was great and hygiene were maintained too.. I had a good time with my princess. Nice ambience and could find all the necessities inside a room.. staff were friendly and responsive
"Excellent location, world class service and very friendly staff. Safe distance management was strictly adhered to. Hotel room was clean and comfortable. Interior design of corridor and room looked slightly old (i.e. classic oriental style). Room cleaning service was amazing, hotel staff really put in effort to tidy up the place and gave us new towels. Buffet breakfast was ok, not many variety of food to choose from but the quality was not bad. A nice staycation choice overall, we will definitely consider to come back again next time."
"We thoroughly enjoyed our 3D 2N staycation at the mandarin orchard . Our checkin was a breeze and only took 5 minutes . The staff were very friendly and hospitable and throughout the stay they made us feel very comfortable . A big shoutout to the Gentleman at breakfast (older Indian I believe ) who was so polite and friendly . Overall, we enjoyed our stay and had a fun time exploring the Christmas decorations at orchard . Thank you to the staff for making our stay memorable ."
"It is not easy for hospitality now. Hotels are busy with guests and required to service at their very best with lean manpower. News are out to share the things happened in hotels recently. After analysis of the situation and the 4 groups of family members (which include various generation a child,2 teenage, a 90 year old, a cancer patient) that are staying during this school holiday staycation, I came with a plan for a 3 days 2 nights stay over during an extreme busy weekends ( 11 Dec - 13 Dec 2020).  1) Came early to register first, understand that rooms might not be ready till 2pm.Requested for same floor. Patience with the receptionist. Go for a walk (Garden or shopping) and have a nice lunch. 2)Tried to book for a swimming, but fully booked, request to be on queue. Smile and"
The front desk lady there was definitely lack of passion of customer service and spoke like robot. We checked in at 6pm and was still informed there was not room. Pls do not treat your customer like trash even though you have promotion.
Counter staff are polite and friendly. Love the connecting rooms and breakfast portion is good. Location is very convenient however housekeeping can be improved as bedsheets were not changed although we informed the staff that my toddler had wet the bed due to diaper leak. The staff only tidy up the bed and used quilt blanket to cover the wet area.
"The rooms are Big, Clean and Classical with many modern facilities. The Staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Very impressed and surprise. Only odd thing is check out time is so early at 10.30 am. Generally a very nice staycation."
The service from the staff is very good as they are attentive while having a large volume of people in the hotel. They have kept their service standards high and I hope those affected from the Covid 19 recovers fast.
"It was good from air condition system to shower. All stuff were in good condition. Management was responsive. Television was good and big, but not so much channels. Internet speed was awesome. Design of room is also good and spacious."
"We went there to celebrate my birthday. The staff surprised us with a birthday card and cake, provided a room with a good view of Orchard Road, and also wished me happy birthday in person. The room was clean and the hotel was centrally located. The only drawback was the long check-in queue we encountered due to a sudden spike in staycation-goers because of the Singaporediscover vouchers. We queued for only 30 min because we didn’t use the vouchers to book our stay, but heard that those who used the vouchers had to wait even longer. We thought the hotel could have had separate queues for the guests who paid using the vouchers and those who paid in full so as to speed up the process, or at least provide online check-in services so that we don’t have to queue for long. The hotel"
"Very good location. Hotel is a bit old, but room is clean and well-maintained. They can definitely improve on the TV, which currently feels like 20 years ago (it's not a smart TV), where only pay-per-view is available, with no Netflix or ability to connect to iPhone casting wirelessly.  What is very disappointing are (1) food quality and (2) customer service which is rather impersonal. Breakfast is a big let down (a la carte, not buffet, and priced at $36 before 17.7% taxes if not yet included in your room package), so you would be much better off taking that money and eat at other cafes/restaurants in Orchard. The ""famous"" Chatterbox chicken rice (priced at $28 before 17.7% taxes) is also a major disappointment -- we ordered it delivered to room, and the chicken is generally"
Staff managed to squeeze in a swimming slot at 1pm for us and extended our checkout time to 3pm (when the supposed checkout time is 11am). There were also multiple counters to ensure that there is no long check-in time where we’re experienced by guests of other hotels. Staff are also very smiley and patient :)
Cutleries sent for room service were dirty especially the forks. All the dirt or rust in between the forks. I would have to clean the forks and spoons before I can use them for our meals. Another thing I ask for change of bathrobes but it was not.
Overall is good except for the Concierge and Room Service is too slow. The officers in charge for the operators are also slow in response. The food is excellent and the restaurants serve the best food ever.
"We served our SHN at this hotel. Everything was great from check-in to room cleanliness, meals, laundry service & check out. Would highly recommend this hotel. I would commend the laundry staff coz they even sewed up my sweatshirt where it was torn & put in a new zipper for me !!"
"I arrived promptly at 2pm to check in on a weekday and I was caught in a rather long queue. I felt that the process of checking in could be faster if they allowed guests to fill in the forms online while waiting in the queue. Perhaps if you are flexible in your timing, I highly recommend to check-in 1-3 hours later instead. Other than that, the room was splendid and the service staff was very helpful. They tried to accommodate us as much as possible by granting us a late checkout of 1 hour and helping us to store our luggage even after we checked out from a 1-night stay."
"My family truly enjoyed our one night stay.We wished it could have been longer.We loved the hotel ambience and decor.I hate hotels that no matter how clean they look but the musky,dusty smell still lingers.But I was completely pleased with our room located of the 23rd floor (which we were thankfully granted - high floor as requested).No weird smells,nothing!And whatever features there are,were all in great working condition!The location is definitely a plus as well.Overall,my family completely enjoyed our stay.Would definitely come back after this whole covid situation settles.Otherwise,all compliments from us!Special thanks to Leow Lee San and John for their wonderful service!"
"Service of the hotel staff  is commendable. Actually quite impressive that the standard of service is consistently good throughout from counter staff, housekeeping to those at Top of M. The staff gives attention to details to ensure that any feedback or comments given are dealt with immediately. Location of hotel is excellent right in the center of Orchard Road"
"The staff were friendly. Housekeeping was done in a regular and timely manner. Complimentary carpark exit tickets are provided upon request and are valid for a day. The room has a chiller for keeping drinks cool, rather than an actual fridge. Complimentary Internet access (WiFi) is provided and can be accessed even in the lobby."
"Room is nice and clean, a nice place to rest and relax. They have everything you need in the room. Good wifi connection. Staff are friendly, helpful and polite.  Will go back again, highly recommended."
"Enjoyed my stay, room was clean and comfortable to sleep in. Hotel was peaceful and quiet. Location of the hotel is convenient and perfectly located for people who wants to shop around orchard. Perfect for a short getaway."
"Hotel & room itself was lovely with great service during checkin. We even got a free upgrade to a club room. Room was immaculate although the fixtures etc were starting to show their age. Our main gripe was the extremely disappointing food at Chatterbox. The food was really mediocre despite the sky high prices. We ate there for dinner & breakfast using our vouchers. if we had to pay actual prices for the food, it is totally not worth it. Given the sky high prices, we had huge expectations of the food. $30 for a plate of ok nasi goreng or a bowl of terrible wanton noodles is just ridiculous. Even the world famous chicken rice that came with hainanese pork chop was soggy & not fragrant.Xx"
My family had a wonderful experience during our stay there! The check in was attended by Hailee who check us in quickly and accomodated to all our requests. Sazali from concierge who made sure my daughter got to enjoy the pool twice and arranged a late checkout for us. Special thanks to both of them! Will definitely book again in the near future!
"One of the best in term of services rendered, cleanliness and hospitality. At the heart of major shopping centres. Easy access to most eateries and transportations. A stone away from most entertainment outlets. No doubt I had one of unforgettable experiences."
Had a nice stay here where staff were nice and professional. Room was very clean and comfortable and ordering room service did not take long to be delivered to room. Only downside maybe for Muslim guest is that their restaurants not halal certified but otherwise a pleasant stay and would recommend. Great location in Orchard Road too.
Central of town. Convenience to shopping and food. Room's cleanliness is top notch but would be best if there is a sprinkler in the toilet. The mattress are little hard. Also not sure if the socket are working coz we cant seem to charge our handphone.
Nice hotel and location is definitely the best! Accessible by train and food is within minutes. Pool should have kids splash play area then it will be more fun for kids. Overall my kids enjoy the pool.
"Staffs from Front Desk and Guest Services were very accommodating and helpful with our requests. Check in and check out was extremely smooth and hassle-free. Getting around the hotel or outside was quite troublesome due to safe entry check in. Overall enjoyed ourselves, thank you for the unforgettable stay (:"
Checking in is fast and front desk staff is very efficient. Great arrangement (special decorating of the room and a lovely cake) for my Birthday. Great thanks to Ms Dian and Danny Wong. Checking out was fast as well with very nice staff greeting me with a great smile.
"We had a great time at Mandarin Orchard. Location was easy to find and very convenient. Received surprise complimentary cake and it was very delicious.  The interiors do look kind of tired though. And, we didn't get to use the pool cause cause it was fully booked."
"Due to COVID 19, we decided to book a staycation during the December holdiays. I must say that the experience is very good! Though the hotel is a bit dated, but the service and hospitality of the staff makes up for it. Definitely value for money and would like to come back again!"
"Good location, good environment good accessibility,nice staff. Hotel that I would recommend to tourists coming to visit Singapore. I had a wonderful experienced staying in this hotel, wishing to come back again soon."
It was a pleasant 4 days staycation there. Food and shops are all around. View from our rooms were good even though we were just on 13th floor. Connecting rooms are big in size. Beds are so comfortable. My toddler slept so soundly on it! Cleanliness is tip top. V
Everything is good but only the chatterbox food is abit of dispointed as the food is serve cold and just a normal taste food which did not give us a wow factor. So overall is still good. Happy staying at the hotel
"Will patronize again if there is a promotion for family staycation. Location is good as we can shop and eat there conveniently.  At first, when checking in, can't really hear what the girl is talking about, too fast and too soft, she did not tell us much. Fortunately the stay is a pleasant one."
"Mandarin Orchard provided an excellent service that's beyond expectations :) The receptionist was very polite and kind. We were pleasantly surprised when she offered us late check out until 1pm because we arrived at the hotel very very late (around 11.30pm) as we decided to do all our activities first before checking in. Then, we had some trouble trying to access the lift with our hotel card but was assisted by a very humble man at the concierge. Then, when we entered the hotel room, there was a nice chocolate cake on the table as it was our wedding anniversary. I would like to thank all your staff for the service provided. Even though the room fittings were a little outdated, I thought the service provided has exceeded most of the new, five stars hotels. Definitely recommend my"
A warm and customer-oriented hotel. We were given free upgrade to Club room at level 31. Air con temperature is good. Beds are soft. Ours is a connecting room with nice bath tub and interesting shower stand. Great quality in terms of products.
Crowd has been managed properly hence it was a smooth check-in. Check-out is also smooth. Staffs are polite and attends to guests quickly. A special birthday arrangement in our room. Birthday cake sent foc. Breakfast was good and very tasty. We had and enjoyable stay with their superb service. Price is reasonable too.
"So much promoted Express Checkout displays 200$ more charges, which wasn't supposed to be there...again had to go for manual checkout and clear them by talking to them.  Breakfast is not so great..it was just Ok"
booked the regency suit for 2 nights. Room is big but the living area is lacklustre and poorly furnished. Small bathroom. Totally not worth the money. Their normal room is way better. Services of staffs are good and prompt to our additional requests.
"Love how their staff are all so nice and friendly. Hotel lives up to their standard - so clean and well maintained. Very peaceful and quiet hotel. They had a good check in system and were able to clear the long queue fast and efficiently, with good safety measures in place."
"Really enjoyed our stay at the Mandarin Orchard. Hotel is located right in the heart of Orchard Rd, with plenty to do for young and old. Two MRT stations close by which makes it convenient if you want to use the MRT or Grab. I booked 2 x deluxe rooms for 4 days.  I gave the room a 3 star as there was no power sockets at the bed side tables. This means we had to use the spare gpo at the work desk and also unplug the lamp sitting on the work desk. Also, where the kettle is positioned, the cable length of the kettle doesn't reach the gpo provided near the floor. We had to move the kettle to the work desk and use the gpo there. Suggest the hotel provides a power board to charge electronic devices.   Apart from the gpo, the room was perfect :-)"
Went there to celebrate for husband and son bday! They love it so much will go again in my bday! Only sad that the pillow were too soft hope they will change to harder pillow:) didn’t get the chance to swim due to raining days.
Location was conveniently located near malls.  Staff were friendly and smiley. Check in time was reasonable. Hotel rooms are clean. Complimentary carpark provided. Overall is a great stay and will come back again!
I would like to show my appreciation to staff at Meritius Mandarin Hotel for the arrangements that they made for me and my wife. It makes the day memorable for us. The club experience also let us know what is quality service in Singapore. Thanks to all at Meritius Mandarin.
"Just ended a wonderful staycation at Mandarin Orchard. The service staff was great, the rooms were clean & very spacious. This is our 3rd staycation in Singapore. We previously stayed in Sofitel Sentosa & Grand Hyatt, but Mandarin Orchard is by far our favorite!  I would like to personally thank Syaza who made our stay very memorable. Given the COVID situation, you will need to pre-book hotel facilities (this is the same for all hotels). Syaza was very attentive and offered to book pool & gym slots for us. Being a very active couple we were really happy about this! Aside from that, she told us where to park our car, where to get the complimentary parking coupons, informed us in advance that our room service bill will be charged from my deposit since we are doing express check"
"We stayed very short period in Executive Suite, our experience was fantastic, especially Lounge M. Start from the ambience, food, hospitality all in a exceptional level. If time permits, i would like to visit again."
"A good working environment away from the normal office space. Even when working in a standard size room, both of us have enough working space between us to properly set our work equipment up and able to have a well balance work, rest and play."
"Room turned out to be much smaller than what was presented to me when I was booking the room months ago. I had to chase after staff several times to get the complimentary birthday cake for my friend, only got it after my 3rd try. Breakfast food was terrible, not worth the top-up of $28++ per pax."
Frontline are the most important people. They have done above expectation during this pandemic situation. Will want to find time to arrange another staycation soon. Keep up the good work Mandarin Orchard! Thank you!
"My husband and I were celebrating our Anniversary and the hotel staff made our stay a very special celebration.  They surprised us with a decorated room and surprise cake.  We could tell that all the staff, from reception to housekeeping, even to the temperature taking ambassadors,  took pride in the warmth that Meritus Mandarin is known for. Made us feel very special indeed!"
It was an awesome experience!!! We got an early check in and late check out. The staff were wonderful and we got to use the pool and gym every single day despite the covid protocols! Mr Zaki at the concierge was wonderful and housekeeping staff were so friendly. This is my second staycay (first was in 2017) and looking forward to staying a 3rd time!
Our brief stay at the hotel's room with club access was really exceptional with really friendly and helpful staff who were always quick to our requests and services. We were spoilt for choice at their club room offerings and each staff's service level was great from checking in to in room dining to laundry services to extra pillow requests. They made us feel really warmly settled into a nice spacious room.
Staycation - Everything  is great. Quiet even though at Orchard Road. Location for in middle of city. Comfortable beds and pillows. Long bath and shower are great. Purchase 80 dollar voucher to dine at famous Chatterbox
"The hotel is sited along Orchard Road, right smack in the shopping district. Tons of shopping and eating places around.  Booked an Executive Suite on the 32nd floor for two nights. The main hotel check-in area on the 5th storey was very crowded, but thankfully we were able to check-in on the 38th floor, which was emptier and much nicer. We had access to the Meritus Lounge on the 39th floor, which offered complimentary breakfast, afternoon tea/buffet and cocktails (which offered light food as well). The food quality was not bad, nothing to write home about, but a nice thing to have. And great views! The room itself (the space of two regular rooms) was spacious, one side for sleeping and the other side for lounging. One full bath and one powder room. The bedlinen was ok, not the"
"Hotel stay was good. Location is convenient. Check in long queue but fast. Buffet breakfast was replaced with set breakfast which is limited to eating in only and one set per person. Was looking forward to Buffet breakfast and if this was made known earlier, I would not have chosen this package. Very disappointed. If not overall, it was a nice experience."
Considering this hotel? Just go for it. Slightly outdated and old looking but they make it up for the refurnished (I think) rooms and service.  Everyone was great from check-in to the stay to calling operator to check out. Gogogo
Staffs are polite and helpful. They managed to attend to my last minute request to decorate the room. Although the decorations are simple but they gave a card wishing us happy anniversary. The bed and pillows are comfortable.
1) Daily food deliver not on time 2) The corridor to room entrance got strong cigarette smell but there is a no smoking sign 3) wait too long for check in & check out room 4) need to improve quality of food for those in quarantine room
"Good experience, with great service. Definitely worth the price. Clean rooms, very convenient. Used the klook vouchers, had a great time in the lounge.  Only issue I faced was the lack of parking in the hotel carpark"
Complete experience is good. Check -in was done in a swift. Staffs friendly and approachable.  Rooms quite in bad shape. -Tv switches off on its own several times -Bathtub water doesn't run off.  -Minibar fridge didnt work  -Hot/Cold water valve at the shower didnt change temperature. Continued running hot water ONLY. -The water head at the bathtub didnt work.  -No bidget installed in the toilet. Very inconvenience.   We called up for water to drink but no one came at all.
