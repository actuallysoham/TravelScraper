"Booked a stayca over the weekends (17-18th Apr) for a superior twin room.  Was given a high floor (8th floor) with an awesome city view!  Even though the room was small but it was really clean and just nice for 2 pax!   Staffs were also helpful with our enquiry , friendly and served with a smile.  The hotel is also surrounded by great food!  Overall, awesome experience and will come back again if i have the chance."
"We had early check in at about 10am and late check out at 3pm was granted.I requested for a high floor and it was also granted. The room was rather small at 14 sq m. Thankfully the view made up for the small space.  We could see the Sports Hub, the Singapore Flyer and Village Hotel at Bugis.  Amenities was basic with toothbrushes, shower gel and conditioning shampoo.  I didn't like the dispenser with sheets of paper I stead of a toilet roll.  Thankfully I was prepared and brought my own toilet roll. There is a writing table, a chair and a beside table.  Bottled water was provided and the mini fridge was cold enough to store your own stuff.  No bathroom slippers were provided and we weren't sure if the floor was clean enough to sit on so we sat on the bed most of the time.  There"
"Check-in was quite fast and simple. Rooms were on a nice high floor and had quite a good view. The rooms were quite clean, the mattress was very comfortable but the pillows were much too soft. Bottled water is already provided in the room, only thing missing would probably be a pair of disposable bed slippers. The room could afford to be abit more noise-proof. Could hear people walking and talking in the corridors easily. Breakfast needs to seriously be improved though. The serers were very welcoming and polite with warm smiles, however the western and asian breakfasts should be served hot. It was barely lukewarm. Especially when your serving food like scrambled eggs and bacon, ham and sausage and pancakes, all these should be hot. Its a good thing customers could still toast"
My roommate left his passport in the cab and the hotel did their best to help us wiz finding the cab wiz only one receive. Mr. Faizal Tan has done a very excellent job finally wiz a few hours the passport is back.
I had a great short staycation at Hotel Boss. It wast my first time and I did not have to wait such a long period of time for the check in and checkout. Big thank you to Rachel from Reception who checked us in and gave us a bigger balcony from what we have initially booked. And big thank you to Ryan from Reveptionist as well who waived our late check out fee that we initially agreed to pay. Will definitely come back again!
"The location was nice and the food was amazing , but the rooms were very small  The staff was was very nice and adjustable  I would recommend that people should visit the hotel  The ambiance was good and the major attraction was the swimming pool"
A very pleasant and satisfying stay with a helpful receptionist Nabila who handled our check-ins. She fixed our bookings process with patience and professionalism.  A very strategic location. With halal food and shopping paradise within the vicinity walking distance.
"Hotel Boss is about the location. There is a bus stop right in front of the hotel and Lavender MRT Station is 200m away. Bugis and City Hall area is a short bus ride away and Kampong Glam is within walking distance. Check-in was surprisingly quick, given the long queues inside the lobby as well as 2 separate long queues outside the hotel (one along its drop-off point via Syed Alwi Road and another along its front - Victoria Street). The staff were friendly and welcoming. Pretty good attitude given the large crowd and check-ins.  It's a mid-range hotel with many rooms. The rooms, however, are pretty small. Tiny, I would say. I have got a Triple Room and the distance between the foot of the bed and the desk is about a person's width. The en-suite toilet is tiny too. A big-sized"
"I'm very happy with my stay at the Hotel Boss. Location was perfect as it's very near to shops ect. Staff NURUL was helpful, nice, friendly and welcome to answer all my question with smile. The room was very clean with comfortable bed and a big balcony. The view was nice too. Thank you Staff NURUL for your excellent services. I enjoyed staying here and will recommend it to others."
"This 19 storeyed hotel is conveniently situated between L fresh cut fruits, hash brown, scrambled eggs, pancakes, bread with butter or jam and coffee/ tea / fruit juice/ fresh milk avender and Bugis MRT station. There is also a bus stop outside the hotel.  Although the room is small but it is clean and well maintained. Toiletries, hair dryer, fridge and safe deposit box are available. Opt for the room with breakfast. Can have either Asian or western set breakfast . Both are equally delicious and wholesome. Western set comprises fresh cut fruits, hash brown, ham , roasted potatoes, sausage, bacon , scrambled eggs, pancakes, cornflakes with milk , bread with butter or jam and coffee/ tea / fruit juice/ fresh milk. Asian set includes fresh cut fruits, Nasi lemak , fish cake ,"
Well it was nice. I love its location. I am a Bugis Junction fan and its surrounding area. Just feels home too. I love the pool it was nice. The beds are good. Toilet is exceptional. The shower is working well. No problem with the sink. Its not 32m square so thats why the room I rent was a little squeezy. But I am roaming around most of the time outdoor.  The Plasma TV was great too. Overall had a nice stay.  Thank you.
"I just had a resting Time at Hotel Boss. Classified as a bit above Average as it has a Gym and a swimming pool which is a node above the Budget Hotel.  The staffs here are friendly and met some Sporeans who are also on Staycation there, seems that they are also enjoying themselves. The location is good as it is not too far from the city.   It is also suitable for couples for a Staycation as mine was Queen size bed. They have parking spaces  for those who drive which is convenient.  Overall, I find it relaxing at a stay at this Hotel !"
"Thanks for cleaning my room...will miss you☺️ thank you so much miss thuy for assisting clean my room during my stay, thank you for all staff in hotel boss especially miss fiona very friendly, satisfied stay"
"Would like to dedicate a special thanks to a Hotel Boss staff, Ms Nurul. She was very patient and understanding towards my concerns and it definitely ease my stay with my family there. Amazing customer service and will recommend family and friends :) Definitely won't be the last!"
"It's awesome, i got the best service while i visited there. Without missing any single details out regarding the hotel facilities, and this staff name "" Nurul "" is the one who helped us with every needs like towels, toiletries and so on. Thank you nurul for helping us!!"
"at the end of the month I will be moving to a new apartment but this will be available only 20 days later. After the recommendation of a friend, who told us that the beds and facilities at the hotel were very good despite the small room and the poor service, we decided to try to ask for a quote. Since it is a ""different"" quote, I thought it would be better not to book on the website and I tried several forms of communication, all without answer, until now.   Today we made a call and were attended by a rude person, difficult to understand, who insisted that we would be doing SHN when it is not the case and in the end he ordered us to book on the website.   People urgently need to be better trained, this is not acceptable for a hospitality industry"
"Pleasantly greeted over at the counter, and was given room on the upper level. Beautiful view, especially from the balcony. Mini ants is unavoidable coming off from the balcony and was on the tabletop. The manager Justin was helpful and efficient, wasted no time to assist when there's issue with the room door. Will recommend this place to my family and friends for sure. Adequate place for a short staycation."
"Today is my last day of my staycation at hotel boss and i think i shall give my thoughts on this hotel. I booked the room with the balcony and my room is on the 14 floor. The view out of the balcony is pretty mediocre but in my opinion (FYI: the balcony have no privacy at all so PLEASE do not be in your birthday suit). Jokes aside, when i entered into the room the first time i was surprised that it was soooo small when i say small i meant really small but it isnt much of a problem. The cleanliness of the room i’d say is 4.5/5. The bed is decent size and comes with 2 pillow total one for me and one for my GF. On the second day we decided to ask for 2 more pillow and when we ask the counter for pillow, i was greeted with a kind gentleman that promptly asked me for my room number"
Had a pleasant stay overall satisfied. Affordable booking and Highly recommended by (Nurul)tripadvisor for my stay @hotel boss. Will look forward to make a reservation through her again. Thank you so much
"Dear Ghuy, We sincerely appreciate your good manners and professional experience. During we stay hotel Boss room 1182 and 1184 from 2020 April to 2020 December. It's important to us, as we know staying in the safety and quiet room. As a enthusiastic, happy and positive one, you give us many helps. Thank you once again and we look forward to you next stay with us."
"Nurul Kassim was very friendly and helpful with our requests even though we cancelled our initial booking as we wanted to use the SingapoRediscovery vouchers. Rooms were a little small though, expected it to be bigger :-( And cause it was raining the whole day, we eventually didn’t get to go to the swimming pool as it was closed."
"Check in took less than 20 mins. Had to fill up forms and verified documents all due to Covid. Room was ok. Standard toiletries were provided. Only can watch local channels and can connect Youtube from hp to tv. Can see the Arab Street view.  2nd day, card was locked. Had to go down to fix the issues. Thankfully, one of the staff on level 1 was there to assist. So had to go up and down nonetheless it was solved less than 20 mins.   Check out took less than 10 mins. Good overall stay. Bus stop directly infront of hotel. There is a Cheers outside. Walking/bus distance to either Lavendar station or Bugis."
"After quite a bit of search and through scanning of the hotels in Singapore we freezed on this as it was our first trip. Location wise I would say one of the best, centrally located close to Bugis and Lavender MRT stations and close proximity to Orchard road, city hall and Bugis, buses available a step away. The famous Arab street is just a short walk away. The lobby of the room was really nice but the rooms were really small. Check-in was a breeze but the front office could be a little more courteous. Many restaurants and food options in the vicinity and we decided not to opt for in-house breakfast and thought to explore the many eateries in the surrounding.  Overall we stayed for 5 nights and I would recommend this place to fellow travelers."
"My family went on a one night staycation on 19 Dec. The lobby was nice but the room was really small. But still clean in general, except for a few ants crawling around on the table. We were served by Fiona and Lionel at the lobby upon registration. They were very friendly and helpful. They made us felt warmly welcomed and answered all our enquiries regarding our stay.  I was pleased with the accommodation and food, however, i was very upset and disappointed by the swimming pool queueing system. We had staycations at other hotels before and the swimming pool slots were assigned and we just had to come down to the pool during our assigned timeslot. For Hotel Boss, we had to rush down to queue in our swimming wear as it was based on first come first serve system. My husband brought"
"Check in & check out is a breeze. Stayed for 2 nights/3 days. Room is really small but if you're staying alone its acceptable. Room has a smell (not quite sure what it is, maybe a cigarette smell? but unlikely as hotel is a non smoking place). I was looking forward to a cable channel but was disappointed when I was told that at this time no cable channels (when I was really looking forward to watch all cable channels available)  Internet connection is rubbish , I had to call twice! (3rd time I was able to fix it myself) for someone to fix it as I cannot watch tv (otherwise local channels) as Youtube is directly connected on tv. Room service isn't that good too, I need to do a follow up call a few time as time had passed already and I still don't received my request. And another"
"1500 rooms and 20 longchairs at the pool, you do the maths...""come to queue every hour"" told me the staff! Like if I wanted to spend my holiday queueing!! Covid-19 is the excuse the hotel uses to justify one of many lies: queueing at the pool (no booking possible), our family room looks like a dark closet, the noise on the balcony gives the feeling to be on a highway... Nice job done on Internet to make up the reality! Cant' wait the breakfast, it should surely be an ""interesting"" experience."
"Managed to check in early as per informed by Reservation. Location is good. Bad experience when check in. Was served by Chris at the reception. Attitude is super lousy & Impolite. Never inform about the lunch or dinner included as mention when Reservation made. Also never mention about late check out which was mention in the reservation email by hotel boss. Only upon asked, his reply is ""have lah"" & ""have lor"". Other hotel staff are more polite. Especially those at lobby area. Room is small and price is average. Lunch set also cannot make it. Chicken chop n fish fillet is cut into half of actual size. Room have smoking smell. Especially in toilet."
Meena clean our room very good. She's very approachable and thoughtful. I like his service. She's friendly and always smiling to every guest.  Ms. Fiona Liu very approachable and thoughtful easy to ask questions to her she's always keep smiling and also pretty.
"Fiona Liu attended to my lost car key which they found at level 4. After waiting awhile for about 45 mins, i approached her and she helped me. thank you!!!! appreciate it so much!!!!! looking forward to coming back now"
"Abit disappointed with the front desk service as I book direct and was asked to checked out at 12pm. The lady was kinda rude and rushing to finish attending to me. It was my birthday and my family was looking forward to this staycation. Definitely not happy with the service given. Need to improvise. I know it’s on full occupancy and there were too many guests but atleast some smiles are good enough.   Rooms was in a decent size, all clean and in good condition. Did get a low floor but it’s okay. Tv was good with youtube. View was beautiful.  Jubilious restaurant served halal food and it’s great! Pool was huge and looks clean.   Overall I would rate 5 stars if not for the rude and unpleasant service from a few front desk employees..."
Upon check-in told i need two pillow and blankets for my child they acknowledge and say ok will send to room...slightly in afternoon call to remind also say sorry they will expedite and send over...still no new repeat around another 4 times still same answer...decided not to stay due to disappointment i ask my family to pack and check-out.At the counter upon check out told the staff my problem..they show no regrets and did not do anything about it and juz say sorry thats all with arrogant face impressions...very disappointed with the service never Recomend to any1 as 1st time in my hotel stay i have to check out middle of night due to disappointment..hotel room also too small and expensive SGD $115 compare to my previous hotel stay which i’ve paid $70 a night at D’hotel(which
"I stayed in Hotel Boss from 10 to 11 December 2020. My friend and I just needed a break from work to detox our minds. The location is awesome as we are surrounded by different kinds of eateries and the malls and bus stop and train stations are in walking distance. Upon arrival at the hotel, the check in was a breeze and the staff was so friendly. When I went up to my room, the room was clean but due to my friends medical condition, the room was not satisfactory. I went to the lobby and met staff Ryan. I explained to him the situation and without hesitation, he assisted to change our room before my friend could arrive. The room had an great view of the area around and even the Singapore Flyer. The next day, we spent some time at the pool which was exactly what we needed to relax."
"I called in to enquire about my booking and was assisted by Nurul. Enjoyed my stay thoroughly as she went beyond the extra mile & also offered me a free upgrade. Room was clean, big & cozy for families or couples."
"Booked a 3D2N stayed with hotel boss. Front office staff upon coming was normal but HSKP team deserve a bonus ! Even I I rejected the make up room service in the morning , but HSKP still take effort to offered me new towel and more water bottles with a positive attitude . Kudos to HSKP team."
"We had a simple repainting of the house and wanted to get the kids out of the way, we had an impromptu stay at Hotel Boss. Any last minute booking in Singapore would have cost a bomb but Hotel Boss was priced very reasonably.  We were checked in by Hidayah who was friendly despite being swamped with a super long queue at check in. We got two rooms a triple and a superior double. very ample for a family or three children aged 13, 11 and 5.   Hotel itself was clean. facilities like the swimming pool was as well. Safe distancing measures was up. Only downside was that the the double room reeked of cigarette smoke. We mentioned it to the housekeeping staff who immediately applied some chemicals to the air con. Smell improved. But still gave non smokers like us a headache. The hotel"
I am thankful to nurul for assisawting me when i called down asking for enquiries regarding the tv. She helped me alot and every single detail. She didn't leave anything out so thank you for the great assistance!
"had an amazing stay over at hotel boss. Checked in at about 1am in the morning with a friend. staffs were very welcoming and helpful. we didnt being a charger along with us so they offered to charge it for us. A staff named Nurul also gave us a complimentary Late checkout as i was not feeling well in the morning. All in all, i'll definitely come back again."
it was a pleasant stay at hotel boss. Their staff was very friendly and welcoming. enjoyed our birthday celebration there. highly recommended to all. thank you once again for your great service. 😄😄😄
"Stayed 2 days for a birthday celebration, Was having difficulties, in choosing rooms from booking online. Decided to call mainline for assistance, Nurul was very patient, friendly, and accommodated to all my needs. Upon check in, we were greeted by Ashween with a smile, She also politely answered all of our enquiries. Room was nice, clean and comfortable. Not forgetting Nabila that assisted us during check out."
"We knew our staycation started in the right track when we stepped into this hotel. We stayed at the premium queen balcony room. This is our 3rd time staying in your wonderful establishment. All our stays has been very satisfying and extremely pleasant. Your staff with their high attentiveness and diligence have been simply outstanding. Special mention to Duty Manager Ryan for his attention to details and his proactiveness to always go out of his way to make us feel welcome and at home. Exhibited diligence, dedication and commitment.  Not forgetting all his front office staff who were equally outstanding and dedicated. Needless to say, housekeeping was equally prompt with their service. Rooms were always well and neatly maintained.  Pool area was excellent. Well maintained, huge,"
"Booked a last minute 2 night staycation here, enjoyed my time even though it was last minute. Conveniently located. Special thanks to Nurul Front office executive for her assistance with the enquiry that I asked for. And also for the eric for the smooth check in."
"I've stayed at Hotel Boss several times before and so far I have enjoyed my stays. This time around I've decided once more to try a 2 nights retreat to recharge and relax away from my rented place. This hotel is also memorable for me since it is one of my go to hotels  to book whenever I have loved ones visiting. Firstly, the price is right on the spot for a 4 star hotel which is not too expensive. I booked their promo for 2 nights which costs me only 188 SGD including tax. Secondly, I personally loved their lobby with the big grand chandelier but I missed the Gloria Jean's coffee right inside it. Their restaurant at the lobby is also closed. Check-in is quite fast as there is no line and my room is quite spacious. It has a comfortable Queen size bed, complimentary"
"No doubt that the location of the hotel is accessible. 200m away from the train station and buses  available a step away from the hotel entrance.  It is easy to get food and there is tons of options.to get food delivery around the area.   Room is pretty small but suffice for a night rest away from hotel and work destress.   However, checking in was horrendous.  I am appalled by the service that were given by the concierge service.  Zero empathy.   This is how the checking in was like :   Front Desk : What can I help you with?  Me : Hi good afternoon to you, I will like to check in please FD :  Do you make booking?  Me : Yes, this is my booking itinerary and heres my identification  Me : If its possible can I request for a room with balcony if available FD : Yes, 20$ extra.  Me :"
"Booked with Hotel Boss for a staycation in the month of October via Agoda. We were not informed that the pool and gym were not available before and after booking, nor informed upon checking in. The purpose of opening up staycation package post COVID19 clearly is for patron to chill in the hotel and use the facilities. Else, are we suppose to just rot in the room? Have also seen group of families in their swimwear facing with disappointment at the pool area. Closing the facilities due to COVID19 measures shouldn't be a valid reason since most hotels have already open them up to the users. Avoiding essential information on the booking page is a form of misrepresentation. Good luck to you."
I enjoyed my staycation here. The hotel is exceptionally clean and the location is perfect as there are nearby eateries. I would like to compliment the front staff at the counter by the name of Ivy as she had made my stay here a good one. We requested for an upgrade of room and she went the extra mile to try to accommodate to our needs and request. She was also very polite and cheerful. I would like the management to recognise her good service. Overall 9.5 out of 10 for the hotel.
Mr Faizal is very helpful and patient staff in Hotel Boss. Satisfied with his service and hotel experience.Hotel view is very nice. Location is very near to downtown and Singapore Sport Hub.Keep it up!
"Friendly and approachable staff, eloquent in communication and for his recommendation on rooms for our short staycation in Singapore. He was speedy in processing our application and it was a seamless experience, thanks Faizal!"
"Dear Boss Hotel management and staff.  I would like to thank Mr  Kenny  for very good service and housekeeping during my hospitality and also special thanks for  for his excellent services & housekeeping, you were very professional in your field and I am really surprisingly regarding to your work dedication.  Thanks a lot again for your service. It was very nice to book in this hotel. We will checking  out soon.  Guest name: KS RONY PAVDAI Room number : 1866"
"My partner & I came earlier without confirming the check in time but Bella & Faizal from front desk was very nice & accommodating. As we were rushing for time, they managed to find one room available, allowing us to check in earlier than we should.   Through it all, they were always all smiles & friendly. Upon entering the room, Faizal even called up to our room to check on whether we’re ok & comfortable with the room given. We mentioned some tv issues & in less than 30mins he was up in our room to check & help us solve the issue.   I’d give his service a beyond exceptionally 5 stars service! Would definitely come back to experience his service again."
"Recently booked a room and was greeted by counter staff, Mr Faizal. Helped us with our concerns and was super friendly. Great staff, great service, great hotel. Would recommend and definitely would come again to relax"
"The hotel is conveniently located, and the room is okay. Worth the price.  Faizal was really helpful and accommodating. Thank you for helping us with the check-in and be understanding with our requests."
"Yu Huan the housekeeping cleaner very hardworking and always assist my request as I has stayed in Hotel Boss for 2 months which arranged by my company , I like the service here because they always very polite especially Fiona from front desk"
I have stayed at this hotel for almost 4month during covid 19 situation and the high quality of service  and attention to details remains. The housekeeping boy is amazing and friendly. The rooms have been clean tidy and immaculate for me everyday. Even though I said no need service everyday because I stay here for a long time. He would still come do service and  always prioritize customer needs and satisfaction first. Anyway thnks a lot to Mr.kenny for your  service all this time.You did a very good job I'll be leaving tomorrow because there's no more hotel sponsor from my company. If next time I want to stay I'll choose the hotel boss because of the service. Thanks hotel boss see you again

Mrs Thuy she is housekeeping very good and friendly  nice to talk and nice to clean  any time she need to help us room very neetness   hotel performance  very good   security  and many time help me 🤴👌🙏😍🤩
"What is it with hotels in Singapore having extremely cramped rooms?  My room was a standard twin bed. There was no space to move after placing two large bags of my friend and mine. The room had a window which was as good as nothing. Anyways- my review will not be based on the room’s size as it’s a common trend in most of the hotels in Singapore. These kind of hotels are good to come back to only sleep, after having spent most of the day exploring the city.  Room- apart from the description above the room had paper thin walls. You would be comfortable to use the bathroom only if you know your room-mate well! The bathroom was surprisingly spacious enough to do your morning duties and have a shower too. I chose this hotel over others as the shower area was separated by a glass"
"I would like to say thank you to chen dan the lady cleaner who cleaned my room everyday for this 2 months, she is very helpful and never forgot to change linen and top up toiletries. Also Fiona liu is good and friendly"
"San geak,lina and arif so good and very clean my room and frindly with me and so understand custemer and can wait me until me free  to clean my room and hotel boss take care  customers and can handle good with covid 19  i give 5 star to hotel boss, and fiona liu good bec want need any help she can help me"
Hi I've been staying at this hotel boss for the past one week.The hotel is easy to find and it's location is near lavender MRT with easy access of public transport and full of historic landmark . I'm pleased with the pleasant and helpful not to mention friendly service by  Staff Kenny. He is a role model for the rest of housekeeping staff. A professional and positive attitude displayed by him. Keep it up Kenny.

"Nathanat, our housekeeper on L18, is very fast and efficient. She is friendly and never fails to greet us with a smile every morning. She seems to know what guests want exactly and most importantly does not disturb guests as she has a knack to know when we require her help. She is a great asset for the hotel and the main reason I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Hotel Boss! A shoutout to Kenny for being friendly and very welcoming as well. The temperature scanner Ali is also good and friendly.   Kudos to the great staff at the hotel!"
"Stay in level 17. Auntie See Yang very good service, every day will give me water, i like her to clean my room, always friendly.... Location is good to go everywhere, thank for Fiona liu the nice card"

"Room cleaner chen dan very helpful , clean the room very good and the toilet also, always smiling and friendly, level 4 washing area always crowded , thank you for the lovely card from ms fiona liu the assistant guest service manager."
I have stayed in this hotel throughout the lockdown in Singapore and was very satisfied with my stay. Well managed covid-19 precautions and I especially liked the staff on the 18th floor. Kenny and Nanthanat were a great help and very nice people.  I will be coming back.
"Kenny and Nanthanat, this two guys very excellent in work n Relational. If I give rate sure I give 5* for them. Thanks for Fiera Lou for u r nice card. The Hotel Boss is good n great.... Thanks for everything."

"Tried Hotel Boss as my friends have stayed and introduced us. Pretty good location, quite easy access to some areas.   Rachel was nice and she attended to us very nicely, good attitude. Room was clean but not as spacious as I thought. Good for a short trip!"
The room we previously had was very small and crampy. The officer who attended to us suggested the family room and he upgraded us with a good price. The family room though it was a little larger than the previous one bt it fits all of us nicely..
"Friendly staff and nice hotel Clean, comfortable and care. Near to go anywhere.  Near to mosque, restaurants, Mustafa, bus stations MRT.  Nice view. A staff name Leslie and friends such a good and friendly to us.Tqvm."
"The service was very bad and unprofessional. We requested for water to be sent to our room and we waited for almost 45mins and had to call twice. They were not apologetic at all. Later the night we requested for fork and spoons as we wanted to eat in our room but to my horror, they said they were out of spoons?? What kind of 4 star hotel doesn't have enough spoons.. They eventually provided us with two wooden chopsticks and two plastic forks.. what a disappointment. And to add on, when we checked in, the room floor was dusty and didn't seem to be cleaned properly, did not feel comfortable staying here at hotel boss."
"Hassle-free with Fiona Liu. Efficient and professional. Thank you so much! Thank you for also making my 18th birthday memorable with the good services and booking issues. I accidentally made a wrong date book but with her help, everything went by smoothly"
"It's a budget friendly hotel located very nearby to little india food market. The services are amazing. The breakfast overall was amazing but as a pure vegetarian I just had a option of bread,tea and coffee. So a drawback for food options book without breakfast and u can go to nearby Indian chain of restaurants. Overall a pleasant stay . There is bus stands and metro station nearby which is a plus point. Below pics are the view from my room."
This is a very clean and practical hotel in an ideal location. I got a taxi from the taxi and was shocked by a) how cheap it was but b) how well organised everything was when i arrived at hotel boss. Tan Lin Chong showed me to my room and was very kind and helpful! Thanks!
"My daughter and I recently spent 6 days and 5 nights in Singapore.  Hotel Boss gave us a clean, compact twin bed room with all the facilities one expects of a good business hotel, and at a very reasonable cost.  Its location is perfect for quick access to the metro or bus services and it is within walking distance of many places on the first-time visitor's list like Kampung Gelam and Little India.  Besides that, it is quite close to the airport so the cab transit is cheap.  If you choose (and I recommend this) not to eat breakfast at the hotel, there are dozens of options to fit every appetite and budget just outside and a few steps away.  The reception and housekeeping staff were friendly, helpful and efficient.  If I had the opportunity to visit this wonderful island again, I"
