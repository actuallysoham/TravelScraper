The service desk staff were amazing. Mr Eran from the blue jasmine restaurant treated us really well! Great service cause he gave us food for my grandma who needed a very early breakfast(a kaya toast set and orange juice) due to her diabetic condition and allowed us to have a proper seat-in breakfast later on. Rooms were really small for handicap bound. Nice stay overall.
"It was located above Farrer Park Mrt station and near to City Square Mall. Very convenient. Breakfast was limited with choice of set A, B, C, D. Food served was cold, toast was hard. Waitress served tea and coffee without sugar or milk, and she seems unhappy to bring the sugar to us. We book a loft room, with an extra bed at the lower level, it was super squeezy for 3 adults. There was an unpleasant stench on the fabric sofa, the management should look into this. Called up the hotel a couple of times for early check in but was told to call on day of check in. On day of check in, called and was told to call again nearer the check in time! No difference at all then. Anyhow if you are looking for a cheap get away, this is still ok!"
It was a great experience staying at Park Hotel Farrer Park. Great rooms. Their pool is also great. The service at the restaurant by the junior staff member could have been better but then again their learning.
"A great hotel for staycation - ideally located above Farrer Park MRT and with convenient access to City Square Mall, Mustafa Centre etc. We stayed for 2 nights. The check-in process was quick and efficient and we got our room key in less than 5 mins.  Because it was so central to everything, we took the MRT to Harbor Front to hike along Mount Faber, Henderson Waves, Forest Walk all the way to Hort Park and Labrador. Then, we took the MRT back to the hotel - so seamless and convenient.  The Housekeeping was also very prompt in accommodating our requests for replenishments. All in all, a very good stay."
"The room is clean and tidy. The housekeepers are extremely polite. I like their services. However, I see an Asian woman wandering on my floor talking on the phone all the time. Initially I thought she was a guest but I see she wears the hotel uniform. I swear to god she talks EXTREMELY LOUDLY I have to sleep during the day since I have class at night. Worst experience ever!!!"
"Children liked the loft and enjoyed the stay. They also enjoyed swimming and jumping into the pool. Housekeeping staff was considerate. Check in was fast , staff was nice. Convenient place with mrt and City Square Mall opposite."
"Without doubt one of the favorite hotels I stayed so far. Upon arrival we were warmly welcomed by the staff and ambassadors. The staff was extremely friendly, the restaurant services great and the booking system due to Covid-19 is efficient. Although the stay was short, we had a very good experience.  Thank you for everything - All the staff are amazing and we really appreciate the help and level of service we received with every request and interaction.  Note, this is not a 5-star hotel or so, but the atmosphere is so special that it really felt like home to me. All respect for the general manager who does a great job here; a true sample of excellent hospitality!"
"My room's bed was thoughfully decorated. Love the premier loft, beautiful view from the window.  Room is equipped all the things I needed. I like the aircon system, sensitive & adjustable. The TV system has many channels & able to sync my hp to tv screen."
Overall it was a good staying experience. Except for non king size bed option. I would recommend staying in the hotel. The staff was very friendly and approachable. The swimming pool was clean and well maintained.
I have enjoying my stay with Park hotel Farrer check in on 8th April staying in Loft room 2018. Staff very friendly and attentive check in process very fast room is nice a d clean. Swimming pool at level 5 with nice view   Definitely will come back again and will recommend this property to friend and relative keep up a good job to give every guest a good experience stay at Park Hotel Farrer. Special mention to FO Pinky who have serve us during check in she always smile and provide us all the information that we need she is a good asset to the company well done. Thank you Park Hotel Farrer. Ismail Marican
Was informed that breakfast not included in my stay when I checked in. Ask for birthday decorations only got 4 miserable balloons. Not even have a slice of birthday cake.it my actual day of birthday. Only manage to ask for late check out. Haven’t check out time staff come in. Lucky we are not changing or anything. Or else very embrassing. Bad experience. We won’t be back again. And won’t recommend to friends at all.
"Worth for the price, location is best to travel around. Ally of restaurants nearby. Service was good. Hotel facilities is easy to access. Wifi was good. Will recommend this hotel to others and i will book this place again."
Front desk staff were quick with their check in and check out process and were very friendly . Booked the sky loft room and it was beyond expectation . Definitely would be back to Park Hotel Farrer Park for another staycation . Thank you for your wonderful service Park Hotel !
ok lar... perhaps can have more tv channels. i have no chance to try the breakfast and use the facility. If git chance i will come again and try the swimming pool and gym. Perhaps hotel can give me complimentary stay fro one night stay.
Good hotel with excellent service and facilities.Breakfast also comes with nice food and choices.The location is also good with public MRT just next door. The room is also awesome and clean. I will definitely recommend this hotel.
"Very very good service, big shout out to Mahan. He is the best receptionist I have ever met. Despite the super last minute screwed up, he still ensure my check-in is done without any hiccups. Very patience and thoughtful receptionist, thank you."
"Poor service. Long check in time. Arrived as per allocated and waited for 2 hours to be able to check in. Despite arriving earlier than allocated slot, staff claimed that we werent ""early enough"" hence the 2 hours wait."
"The hotel lobby is small but it didn't fill up when I was there.  Plenty of seating area for guests to wait (lobby and the adjoining cafe).  Staff were friendly, welcoming and gave clear instructions (health declaration, SafeEntry, etc.).  Check-in was smooth but had to wait a short while for rooms to be ready.  Staff informed of complimentary drinks and to wait at Blue Jasmine, an in-house restaurant on Level 5.  Was able to sit, rest, have a drink and wait for the staff to approach you at your table with your keycards once your room is ready.  This is such a thoughtful gesture.  The hotel is located diagonally across the road from City Square Mall and right behind the Little India MRT Station Exit A.  There is a 7-Eleven at the station exit and there is a 24-hour access at One"
Stayed in Sky Loft Room with 2 different groups. 1. Couple staycation: is perfect size and is cozy. Everything was great including the breakfast.  2. Family: is too small for more than 4pax. Pool might not be idea for kids shorter than 0.9m? They have a small pool but it look like pond instead. Nevertheless with float everything is possible just pool operation is 7am - 7pm so try to snatch the slots flat.
The Crystal Queen and Sky Loft Rooms were really classy and comfortable. The interior furnishings gave the room a cosy and warm feel which made the rooms so much more like at home. Breakfast was generally satisfying with its spread of Asian cuisine.
"Check in with my family on 1-3 April 2021. Other then the premier loft room being a little small for my family of 4, the service given by the staff was fantastic. Staffs were very attentive and friendly, special thanks to front desk staff Ms. Joanne for writing a birthday card for my son and stay back till 11+ pm to send it up to the room personally with a small gift.  Also to Jenny and Paulyn for their kind assistant during our check in and daily breakfast.   Our family enjoyed the stay at the hotel."
Service should come from the heart. Almost non-existent from staffs who are clearly worn out. Do treat local and tourist the same. I think that is a fair expectation. There is a lot of area for immediate improvement which the management should look into.
Good: Loft room available. Staff is attentive (helped setup surprise deco for birthday room). Rooms available upon check in. Bad: very slow lift (1/3 lift down). Very small room and toilet. Room service is slow.
"Everything went smoothly from the booking, to the check-in. Service was great with many friendly staffs. Cleanliness of the room is there. Pantry is full of choices, even though it's only coffee and tea."
"We spent 2 nights weekend Gateway at Park Hotel Farrer Park.  The stay was fantastic, my son enjoyed it so much, especially the loft bed, he imagined it as his Lab.  The staff were very helpful  and friendly.  We'll definitely come back next time"
"While we were in the hotel, a hotel staff came into our room. They doorbelled several times to check if we are in the room but I was using the shower and my partner was asleep - so we could not answer the door on time and they barged in (my shower door was not even fully close and i was not clothed). Our room cleaning switch was not on as well. It was traumatising and a very horrible experience. No compensation was made to us... and the hotel staff (we are not even sure if they checked the CCTV and took action). We do not know who came in as we were both engaged. It was truly an invasion of our privacy  Because of the incident that happened - we are very doubtful to stay here again. At the very least, we would like an explanation for the service and a compensation. It ruined our"
"A personal retreat to reflect and rejuvenate! Park Hotel offered the best food, best restful quiet room and also the best luxury toiletries to get in touch with my inner self. Will do it all over again"
"Staffs were friendly and requests were promptly attended to. From lobby to room feels clean and fresh, seems like cleanliness is top priority for hotel.   Location surrounded with many food options. Great place for a short break!"
"The room was the same as advertised on their website. It is not big but sufficient. The receptionist and housekeeping were helpful and friendly, especially the housekeeping staff.  The gym was smaller than expected, and it is not in the same building as the rooms. Perhaps due to the time I went to the pool, I had the swimming pool to myself.  However, one downside would be their restaurant, waited quite a while before the staff served me, and they did not even serve my breakfast meals right."
"It was a great experience. Service was good. Room was clean.  We love the breakfast. Staffs were friendly. Check in was smooth. Location wise, very convenient and accessible.  Next to City Square and Farrer Park mrt."
"We booked during the promo book 1 night free 1 night. Well worth it! Location is nearby the big mall, lots of eateries and below is MRT station. Room is in loft style. but a bit tiny when there are 3 pax inside with the extra bed. otherwise if it's just 2 pax, will be just nice. Will be back for sure."
A stone away from City Square mall. Check in procedures can be better with lesser waiting time. We we're prompted to choose our booking time but after arrival despite coming on time we still had to wait about 1hr.
Had a pleasant experience here. Room was clean and the overall ambience is pleasing. We managed to catch the sunset at one side of the room. There's a lot of tv shows which are nice. Sofa was great. Only downside was the toilet tap was a little too on the inside that its a little obstructive
Great service and clean hotel! Would appreciate a better selection of food choice for breakfast but nevertheless worth the stay and definitely will be back again for the 4th time...my family love it here!
"Clean rooms however window cleanliness can be improved. Cosy and great for families. Pool was amazing! However we had to pass by the restaurant for the pool access. Adequate facilities in rooms with minibars, complimentary drinks like tea and coffee. Stone throw away from City Square Mall, Farrer Park Mrt station & Mustafa Centre."
"Hotel is very clean and modern. The room was impeccable, abit small and hard for wheelchair bound brother to manoveur, staffs were friendly and polite, excellent customer service, very clean and stunning room. Thanks park hotel ✌🏻 It was a pleasant stay for me and my family!"
"Overall service is good. The aircon is not cold enough even though i try adjusting it.But I ok with it. I dont have bathrobe in my room. Sad as I do not get to book the pools as the staff did not insert a QR code when I check in. By the time I ask for it, its already too late as the slots has all been taken up."
1st time staycay here. Love the simple and easy check-in from the reception. The Loft room is just nice for solo or couple and the cleanliness is just top notch. Will definitely comeback again for my staycay.
Had a solo trip. Fast check in.Friendly staff. Very clean toilet. Beverages could be better though. Toiletries are ok. Very comfortable bed. Had a great undisturbed sleep Will come again for breakfast next time soon.
The hotel is situated in town area. It is very convenient as the train station is just downstairs. Across from the hotel there are a few shopping malls. There is also lots of variety of food choices around the hotel to try.
"Do not ever book directly from their webpage as the information from their webpage is not fully accurate.  For example, the check in timing itself is written as 1400. This is a lie. The official check in timing is 1500. Please don't be silly and go early.  Any check in done before 1500 is consider a early check in and subjected to availability  Checked with the staffs, none of them bothered to address the discrepancy and just gave a standard automated answer of check in is at 1500 while assuming I'm requesting to check in early.   Almost vomited blood."
"Very clean and comfortable stay, good view from our room. Very accessible from the MRT. Perhaps can have more variety on the breakfast selection. The handle of the hair dryer in our room is sticky and look old."
"Great hotel for family, the kids love it. Swimming pool is nice with jacuzzi, dry towels are ample unlike some hotel where the towels are not replenished. Wonderful service by staff, we got a loft room to stay and rest while waiting for our booked room to be ready. Superb location where you can find lots of eateries around it. Personally, I think this hotel deserve more."
"Location,service and room are good except for the breakfast.  Look forward to stay again. Hopefully there will be improvement on the breakfast and better price for us to have an excuse to book a staycation"
"It was a cosy and quiet stay. Simple and fulfilling breakfast. Very good customer experience who went extra mile. Staffs are helpful and friendly. Everything was swift from check-in and room order. Hotel is located beside Farrer Park mrt station and City Square Mall so it’s convenient. Also went to the gym and swimming pool. We enjoyed our stay, did not have any issue throughout."
"Overall a good hotel to stay at for budget and location. It is within close proximity to Farrer Park MRT, City Square Mall and Mustafa Center. Rooms were alright and up to standard however inconsistent with amenities. Staff were friendly and helpful."
Overall the stay ead an excellent one. First time staying at the property. No obvious issues on cleanliness or service. Very well maintain. Hope that the management will always look into staffing. As it may hurt much when Covid period is over. Need a helping at the Recep area during peak hours. Overall the family enjoyed the stay there. Would like to come again sometimes
"It is clean, the toilet has bidet (That is a total plus) 5 Minutes walking distance to the Shopping mall. Near to MRT and bustops (convenient for those that is taking public)  There was a hiccup during check-in but was handled swiftly. I don't mind staying here again with family."
We had our stay over the school holidays and naturally the staff were overwhelmed. But they always had a smile on their face and ready to help with requests. Special thanks to Ms Zeharah who helped us with our breakfast and over the counter. She had excellent customer service!
We booked a 2D1N Sky Loft room for a staycation. The room are clean except a little small. Breakfast were quite okay except that the food are cold and we had to had it at level 1 as level 5 were fully taken up despite prior booking but that's okay. Good location as it is just next to Farrer Park MRT station and City Square Mall is just a stone throw away.
"Fuss free check in at the counter. No need to wait long. Hotel room size is average, but at least the bed is King size not Queen size as stated in their website. Swimming pool not that big, average. Convenient location, right outside MRT and beside City Square Mall."
Reasonable price for loft although the sky loft was quite small. The premier loft was acceptable. Easy access to city square mall & mustafa centre. As the hotel is above farrer park mrt it is very accessible. What I like about the hotel is that there is bidet in the toilet.
"Great location. Nice connecting rooms. Didnt know restautant no longer halal-certified, n thus we didnt have bfast there. Wld b nice if hotel cld offer alternative as compensation. Do fill up health declaration for everyone first before checkg in."
"The hotel location is very good, near to the MRT station and a few shopping mall. There are a lot of delicious Indian and Chinese food around that area too. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful."
Perfect location. This was the best & wonderful experience ever. Surrounded by friendly & helpful staff. Thanks again to Marhan for making the effort. Keep it up for the excellent customer service level. Definately highly recommend this hotel for anyone.
I did enjoy a lot although it was a brief staycation. Will come back when the next opportunity arise. Location wise it’s fantastic. The room is great also. I had a blast! Only thing is the breakfast menu is too simple. Hope they can do something about it. Overall it’s good!
1. They prepared a wonderful surprise for our anniversary.  2. Excellent location.  a. Bus b. Mrt exit right next door. c. Food d. Shops e. Mosque   3. Not crowded  4. Clean swimming pool 5. Friendly and happy front desk
"Sky loft room was small, just enough for 2 pax. Not recommended thise with kids. However, it has good view, at top floor. It would be good for those on honeymoon. Breakfast was not very nice, food and menu needs to be improved!"
Good and clean. Worth to pay to stay if the room much more larger and bigger. Lift a little bit slow when coming up and down. Upper loft bed a little restricted can't move around much. Sharing tv remote control so ridiculous. Everytime need to go up and down if u need to change channel.
The hotel is strategically located on top of farrer park MRT and along the Serangoon road (little India). The rooms was decently sized and was very new. There are ample of food and beverage options available nearby. I would highly recommend all to stay at Park Hotel Farrer Park.
The hotel was superb clean. The hotel is near to Farrer Park MRT and walking distance to City Square Mall. Staff were friendly and approachable.  Overall we're satisfied with our stay and planning to stay here again 👍
"The lobby of the hotel is a little bit dark which puts people off. Waiting for the elevators could take a little over 3 to 5 minutes but it is probably due to the high volume of guest in the hotel. The room itself has nice huge king sized bed, nice showers and bathroom. But more amenities could have been added to value add for the hotel. The swimming pool was nice though.   Overall, a great stay at the place but many areas to be improved. Being in a location right in the heart of Singapore, more renovations and consistent maintenance could be done to improve the hotel's overall condition."
Very enjoyable loft room. Room is great with great view of Little India. Good bathroom with high pressure shower.   Some suggestions: - To have more coffee/ tea options for breakfast.  - To have softer pillow options.
"Preferably King size bed & super single size bed for twin room in connecting room..Excellent services, have complimentary of free parking. Have some choices of breakfast, will stay again next time...."
"Our request for connecting room and highfloor with views are fulfilled. Even the room was quite small but the bed was good. Breakfast menu can be better and more variety, guests will get bored if same menu everyday. Minus 1 star coz the room toilet was smelly after the makeup room on the second day."
"The check in was fast! You will need to fill in a form regarding Covid-19 then they will hand you the card to your room. I love how cosy and clean the room was, room service was also fast! Thank you Park Hotel Farrer Park, will definitely return!"
Can recomended for family staycation. Very good location and easy access to everywhere because mrt nearby. Average breakfast but still not bad. Gym also available. Big swimming pool. Overall very satisfied
"Hotel is clean and have clean sheets in rooms. Big king sized bed which is comfortable, slept the whole night. Service is perfect. Breakfast service till 10:30am was good with 4 variety. Hotel is very well accessible and close to MRT too."
Small but clean room. Not bad on the loft feel. Everything is good except for a grinding sound whole night which maybe due to the nearby lift. Good food and service from breakfast team. Checking in and out is fast and great
I have always enjoyed staying at Park Hotel group of hotels. This stay was no exception.  Checking in was a breeze and the room was nice and cozy. Service was impeccable too. Even the part-timers were polite and quick to assist.  Will definitely be back!
"Location was excellent, close to the train station. Mustafa centre within walking distance and also the City Square mall. Stayed at the premier loft, room was too small. Good cleanliness around. Service was fast! (I really like that)."
"Cozy room despite the size. Good lighting, view and use of space. Staff were really patient, polite and helpful. Hotel located right by the purple line entrance, really convenient and no need to book transport for it."
Brought my Mom here to celebrate her Birthday! Great experience. Very clean rooms with nearby shops like Swee Choon Dim Sum and city square shopping mall.   Good service at Blue Jasmine restaurant Level 5 too.   Definitely comparable to other 4/5 Stars hotel in Singapore.
"Check in was efficient. Room was simple, neat and tidy, and it served it purpose well. The only issue i had was that the mini fridge was pretty weak. However, it was a pleasant experience overall and I wouldnt mind going back there"
"The first time when i walked in to the hotel the team member greeted me and assist me. The check in process took a short one Justin showed me the way to my room and explaining to me where all the facilities are located (swiming pool, gym, restaurant). The room was very clean and tidy . For me it was a great first time experience thanks to Justin who was always very helpfull with every enquiry i had.  Blue Jasmin restaurant - they got a big variety of food & most of'em are very  tasty. Takeaway service was very good."
"Firstly,this commendations goes out to  Park Hotel at Farrer Park, F&B personnel , Mr Eran.  His excellent customer service during our breakfasts in the mornings, bright up the staycation mood for my family.He is efficient,pleasant ,cheerful and of coz friendly!My parents were also appreciative of his service.WELL DONE MR ERAN! :)  Next, goes out to the very helpful Mr Firdaus at the Concierge , who assisted us during the checkIns and he ensures the proper SMM are in place to keep us all safe. Thank you very much Mr Firdaus!  Thirdly for Mr Bonnie at the Reception who portrays excellent front line service and assisted us during our checkouts and membership sign ups for better deals! Thank you very much Mr Bonnie!  Lastly, checkout Mr Roy from the room service who attended to my"
"Paid a small premium (can't remember if they called it a Superior or Deluxe) for a room at the higher floor, but the room faced a grey wall so I felt I derived no benefit from the higher floor :')   Was a little unfortunate to be greeted by a cold, unwelcoming receptionist, but I could see that most of the other staff were warm and friendly. Would have taken the individual's name down but he wasn't wearing a badge unlike the rest. Not sure why this was the case.   Otherwise the room and the hotel was very clean. The pool was big enough for the hotel, and clean, with towels available for free. Amenities in the room were basic, but functioning well and well maintained. Not sure if worth the nightly price, though."
"Hotel was clean and nice. Service staff were pleasant and accommodating as we wanted to surprise our friend for his birthday. Location is pretty prime with ample facilities. Nice and clean. Rooms were generally small tho, and Wifi kept disconnecting; but other than that was a pleasant experience. Would return to stay again."
Room was clean and beautiful but it was exceptionally small and tv was only at the upper floor only in front of the bed. Location was really good. Just a few mins walk to city sq mall and Mustafa Centre. So many halal food around the vicinity.
"Location is near to mrt, City Square and Mustafa Centre. Easy to find foods and you can shop at the nearest mall without hassle. Don't forget to ask for complimentary parking when you check out or else you have to pay $70 just for the 2d1n stay"
"My Boyfriend Frederick pulled off a surprise for me yesterday. I had something on so we tried to rebook other day, hotel reservation team agreed but I think Klook giving us difficulty in communicating so in the end weleft with no choice but to just proceed with our stay, we reached about 645pm.  Moving forward, pool was closing and it makes me more disappointed because I want to swim after a long day of surprises. Bonnie was so helpful and explain to us that we wont be allowed to swim already, I understand but I still try my luck to check with 5th floor and I was lucky enough to be assisted by the Hotel Manager Mr. Ken, he was really flexible and gave us extra mile that my disappointment somehow turn into excitement. He advised us to come back at 8pm and so it made us both happy"
"Really enjoyed our stay here at the Park Hotel. The room was lovely, had a nice view and really clean as well. The check in and check out process was efficient and the service was great. Highly recommend!"
Room with nice view because was given to high floor with unblock view but room is abit small though. Very near to train station & also very near to City Square. The staffs were nice & polite. Overall was a good staycation for us though😊
Situated above mrt station. 2 station away from Orchard Road. City Square Mall is just within walking distance using the underpass with a lot of food choices. Room is not big though n can only accommodate maximum 3 pax.
We book this hotel with my family for a staycation during CNY. Nearby there were famous Indian restaurants. Famous Mustafa Centre was around 100 m away. Had great experiences with my family at the hotel.
hotell staffs are super friendly & very helpful. they allowed my family and i to have late check out at 1pm during our stay. also very easy to find halal food as its near city square mall and also little india.
The staff was friendly. The room are design in such a way that you feel welcome as you enter in. The panorama view from the top floor was breathtaking. The location is within the city which is easily access by MRT. Nearby popular attractions for shopping and dinning experience!
"From the front desk, to the banquet and the swimming pool security have been very accommodating. We feel like we pay too little for the service they served us. Strongly recommended! Thank you Park Hotel."
"Had booked 2 connecting rooms from 22nd to 24th January to celebrate my B'day with my family. Was greeted at the entrance by Hotel manager Ken Yong who had waited for me. He petsonally welcomed me n family to the Hotel. While checking in at Front desk,Bonnie n Asst Manager Ashraf who was also present served us efficiently n pleasantly.  We were guided to our rooms n upon entering my room, I was shocked n surprised to find that it was Decorated Beautifully with Birthday cards,balloons n 2 white toweled SWANS placed on the Bed.  They really made my Birthday weekend a very memorable one.  A special moment in my Life was made sweater by the STAFFs of Park Hotel Farrer Park. Thank you guys/gals for a Fantastic birthday weekend stay at your Hotel. We will definitely come over again."
I did not regret choosing Park Hotel Farrer Park for my staycation. My only regrets was i stayed there for only 1 night. The front desk personal was amazingly nice. The room was superb. Beautiful that it makes me regret even more for staying only 1 night. I will come back again.
"Spent 12 days in this amazing hotel smacked in an amazing location with great food all around. Truly enjoyed my stay throughout and with tip top service and very clean rooms, there is nothing more that i could ask for. Everything was excellent and would really love to come back again in the near future hopefully."
All at excellent except for the swimming pool is too damn cold. And for babies there isn’t a any pool. If they have both. It will be best experience so far. Other than that it’s very convenient as it’s easy to access.
"The check-in & out are fast & smooth, the staffs are friendly, the breakfast sets are delicious that my daughter love it so much, the loft type room and the bed are spacious and comfy, except for the swimming pool cause the water are very cold 🥶 🥶 🥶"
Overall it was an enjoyable experience but there was a loud humming throughout the night on the 20th floor that kept us awake on the first night.  The night manager changed our rooms to the 12th floor on the second night and it was good. Service was excellent and the rooms are great.
I was greeted by the people at the concierge. The people working were very polite and nice. During my stay they were able to provide me the necessities that I need. Really great experience here and would come back again!
"Love the view from the loft room! The room has a good size for a couple, good to chill and it is easy accessible to places. With MRT station nearby and good food around the area too. Malls are also in walkable distance."
"- front desk friendly & helpful - housekeeping great & helpful - good view,surrounding is good - pool is good Overall stay with my family is great. Will definitely staycation again. See you soon. Awesome!"
Hotel staff was friendly and provide a warm welcome upon arrival. Spacious room even with standard room size and room was decent clean. Prompt reply on request for late check out and front desk staff was fast and flexible. Great stay!!
Bonnie & his colleague provided smooth check in procedure & friendly service! Answered to my questions too! Thank you to the team for the wonderful Birthday surprise! I will definitely come back for a long stay!
Overall stay was good. The service staff was flexible. I wake up at 10.15am can called the guest service to check if i can change to dine in my breakfast in room and staff quickly arranged to serve my breakfast in my room.
