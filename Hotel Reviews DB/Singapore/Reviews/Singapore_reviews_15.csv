Had a 2 nites staycation with my girlfriend for my Birthday. The front desk staff was approachable & cheerful & check in process was pretty smooth & good. Mr Idil from the concierge was very helpful & helped us to put Birthday Cake in their fridge. The room very cosy & we felt very comfortable. We had the Taiwanese Porridge & was delicious. My last time had the Taiwanese Porridge was in the 80’s. That really bring back good memories. Had a really good chat with Aunty Betty. She’s very kind & cheerful. Looking forward for my next staycation back again.
"This hotel is one of the older buildings in Singapore that is still standing. Rich in history, it was the grand dame of its times. It was a real treat staying there, even though just for a night. We booked a staycation there to celebrate our wedding anniversary and my spouse's birthday. We booked a slot for their sought-after high tea. The food spread was very delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.   The staff were very accommodating and kind. They made us feel very welcomed and also made our young child feel important! They spoke very kindly to him and engaged him in conversation.  Our room was at the Mayfair Wing, overlooking the second (Balinese styled) pool. We had to book a slot for the main pool which was no trouble at all. Our room was clean and very comfortable."
"It was my first time staying at Goodwood Park, and I must say it was a really enjoyable stay, with really excellent service! The staff are friendly, attentive and very warm! The room I stayed in is newly renovated,  and we enjoyed the food at Min Jiang as well as the coffee lounge!"
"I had a pleasant 1 night stay at Goodwood Park hotel, the room was comfortable and clean. The staff there were polite and professional, they guided us to our room knowing it's our first time staying in the hotel.  I would like to give special thanks to Karen who sent a birthday cake and a fruit platter up to my room upon knowing that it was my daughter's birthday.  The complimentary breakfast was delicious as well, the experience is worthy of a 5 star hotel, I would definitely recommend a stay at the hotel to anyone who is interested."
"Traveler came from China and stayed at Goodwood Park Hotel as it is a SHN hotel and knowing that this hotel has fantastic service, swift response, comfortable liasing with especially Doris Teo everytime I have guests coming over to Singapore and they always have positive feedbacks after staying at the hotel. Thanks to Doris and the Room Reservations' team!"
"We stayed in Parklane Studio Suite and the family had a great time. Everything was well organised, with clear advice on check in procedure. A pleasant surprise from Goodwood Park Hotel when we received a cake congratulating my daughter on her recent promotion. The staff had great initiative and are all very friendly, making the stay a beautiful and memorable one. A great place to relax and the location is also very convenient to move around."
The staff at GWP are first rate and nothing is too much trouble - Park Lane Apartments are spacious and well equipped. From the Front Desk to the gardeners and maintenance people they all go the extra mile. I am welcomed by name and they anticipate my requirements.
"Our 3rd stay with GWP and they NEVER disappoint us. Booked a room last minute during Good Friday, our room was not ready and they upgraded us to a premier Deluxe room. Service staff from check in, concierge, bellman and even operators are very warmth and friendly. We requested to refill our bottle water and operator call us back to check if we have received it.. thats a great way to follow up with guest. Overall the man of the hour is Mr Billy who took very good care of us during our stay when we first did a last minutes booking and as we enjoyed our stay so much, we extended another night at GWP. Definitely coming back to try different type of room. Well done GWP Team!!!"
"We booked 2 rooms and were fortunate to be upgraded to Deluxe Poolside Suites.  The rooms were spacious and had a very nice sitting area and the room had 2 large smart TV.   They were recently given a fresh new feel and the decor has a modern touch.  Overall, the room was very tastefully done up.  Service at Goodwood Park is exceptional.  Staff seem to go out of their way to ensure your comfort.    We used both swimming pools but the family found the Balinese themed pool which was smaller than the main pool to be very cosy.  It had a more laid back feel and it was comfortable just to laze around or play with he kids.  Breakfast at the Coffee Lounge was average but the high tea buffet was L'espresso was superb. However, if you like buffets with very a wide spread - this is not"
"Booked a stay at the Parklane Duplex suite. Room was huge and spacious, However, the hotel is a bit dated but everything works well. As with all properties, it is the service that makes the difference. Thumbs up for the top-notch service here. Shout out to all the hotel staff at the front desk /concierge and not forgetting the housekeeping- thanks for the amazing work and smiles! Was a lovely stay!"
"Room is dusty and stain all over, from bed linen to towel to sofa, kitchen equipment stated full equip however, a lot items is missing. Bathroom grouting have mould all around th place. Only 1 tissue box is provided, despite being a 55sqm room. Tv channel outdated. Only provided 2 pillow whereby most of th hotel provide 4. Bathrobe look old and not change from previous guest. Guest letter is torn whereby now is Covid period and still not change th letter being at that conditions below is those stain and dirty linen for all guest reference. Pls do not book this hotel if u wan an enjoyable stay."
"Stayed here for one night for staycation. It was a nice room,quiet with balcony overlooking garden.Super comfy huge bed. We had access to smaller secluded pool,with no other guests,so we had it to ourselves. Very nice. Good breakfast with great staff especially Betty Ho,who was so funny,cute and very nice to have a fun chat with her at breakfast. She is a gem! Nice breakfast,and the staff were very accommodating,and good breakfast selection. Great location as well,near Orchard rd,restaurants etc."
"The hotel is a bit dated but everything works well. As with all properties, it is the service that makes the most difference. You will get top-notch service here. Special mention to Melanie at reception, Lynn from OneTouch Services and Penny from housekeeping."
"Checked in for 4days 3nights on a staycay at the Parklane Suite room. Was told we were being upgraded but doesnt feel like it. Room 422 at Parklane Suite. Room was average, worn out. Old furnitures but new kitchen. Sadly no capsule machine even after i've requested beforehand and they dont seem to have any spare coffe4 machine in the entire hotel. A birthday cake was send right after we checked in which was extremely prompt and caught us by surprise at 3pm. We wanted to move the sofa and a huge big black lizard came running out! I killed it instantly by steeping on it! Didnt tell any staff as i don't see a point to as it is already dead! Only 1 toilet and theres no bidet! The aircon will automatically switch off when you open the balcony door so you will need to spend some time"
"Shoutout to Suresh, whom is one of the managers, and Betty who served us our wonderfully plated breakfast!  It was a short stay here with my family and sibling here at Goodwood, and a good one!   The staff at Goodwood were all very helpful and pleasant, in particular firstly, Suresh. He ensured that our stay went smooth, checking if everything was well, taking in feedback both good and bad, and even managing to solve what went -just a little- ""bad"" for us. You can tell he is experienced and shows pride in his job :)  Secondly we have Betty, a cheerful lady in her senior years, she served us our delightful breakfast at the Coffee Lounge! It was a set breakfast, and we could choose from 4 different cuisines. We asked what certain things were in the menu and she enthusiastically"
"I was looking forward to this staycation in this heritage 5* hotel, and booked a Junior Suite for myself, my husband and our son.  However, the experience didn't live up to the price and the expectations one has for a luxury hotel.  The hotel suffers from a dated set of facilities, some extremely peculiar recent interior design decisions, patchy service and questionable cleanliness.  Whilst all of these things might be acceptable for a 3* or 4* establishment, they're not when you're paying the kind of prices Goodwood Park charges.  Being in a lovely heritage building, you'd expect some old-world charm to the hotel, and the building exterior is very pretty. But, heritage of one thing. Dated and old-fashioned is another.  The Main Pool is very antiquated, and a bit forlorn"

"I booked a staycation for my family during the March school holidays and I must say we are very satisfied and enjoyed our time at GWPH. During check in, I enquired at the front desk to check if I can upgrade to a family room. My request was pleasantly accepted and I was given a very nice family room with the swimming pool just outside. At the coffee lounge where we had breakfast, the service staff were also very helpful and friendly. They asked if we would like additional food such as bread and bacon. Ms Betty offered to change my wife's noodle when she heard that other guests feedback on the noodle could be a bit saltish. S Also Mr Suresh went an extract mile by helping us arranged for late checkout."
"Covid 19 Pandemic had actually brought us to Goodwood Park Hotel (GWPH) for a staycay.  We'd heard lots of positive reviews about  GWPH and decided to try it ourselves.  We'd booked a deluxe room for 2 nights which can accomodate up to 3 pax and we must admit that we'd made a right choice !!  GWPH did not disappointed us. The room are very spacious and clean. It was well equipped and fitted with beautiful artistic wall design as a backdrop.  We were attended by a senior Madam (forgot to ask for her name) & Mohan at the Coffee Lounge. The former was very helpful and also very passionate in sharing the historical story of GWPH. Such a true gem for GWPH.  The front desk staffs were equally helpful. Roman (DM), Geetha & Melanie makes our stay more enjoyable and meaningful...kudos to"
"Some of the facilities (esp. machines in the gym) are old. The main pool is simple but the Mayfair pool is calming. Room space (Deluxe) is comfortable enough to fit 4 and it’s for money.   I am however disappointed with the operator’s service. He seems to have a lack of knowledge on the hotel’s facilities. We called to ask if the hotel provides “bath salt” but he couldn’t understand us, hence we dropped it. Then we asked if we could get an additional soap but we were given shower gel (even though we repeated thrice we wanted bar soap and not shower gel). The most frustrating encounter was when the staff came to our room with the shower gel and claimed “we don’t have that (bar soap)”. So what is provided in the toilet? What do you call that? We had to physically show him the item"
Wanted to thank Nathan for the amazing service on 10th January. He sheltered me swiftly and promptly via the buggy during the heavy rain and was very friendly. Also all the hotel staff at the front desk / breakfast area  thanks for the amazing work and smiles! Was a lovely stay
Booked a 4D3N stay at the Parklane suite. Room was huge and spacious.  Check in process was very swift and organized. Staffs were very attentive and efficient.   Very pleasant stay. Definitely a choice to return for staycation!
"Staff are always smiling and greeting guest, very friendly and approachable. Concerned about our satisfaction on the food, room and overall experience.  Prompt Buggy  Breakfast, in room dinning and room service are all tasty in big portion.  Complimentary birthday cake is an additional surprise. Thanks to all the staff, from reception, house keeping, coffee lounge, buggy driver, Chef, in room dinning waiter and Mr Suresh.   We are always feel welcomed.   Room is clean and spacious, with a living room and an all equipped kitchen, though bed is rather soft to me.   Walking distance to Orchard but in a quiet corner.  Good for staycation."
Book a day in this hotel for staycation and at the same time to view the light up in Orchard Road. The hotel is the 2nd oldest in Singapore after Raffles Hotel. The  main entrance that leads to the coffee lounge has been blocked due to Safe Measurement Management  and has walked go further up on the left hand side of the side of the building. The check-in had to go to through the safe measurement management and the hotel had emailed to inform on the allocated time to check-in. The process was very smooth without any queue. The allocated room was on the same level as the check in lobby. The room is spacious facing outward and the neighbourhood condominium. It was clean and tidy. The hotel has two swimming pools - one at the check-in lobby and the other is further in which is
"First time trying staycation at Goodwood Park Hotel.  Booking of the room experience is just average.  But during checking the staff is friendly and flexible.  When going to the room (Parklane Suite), my family and I are a little disappointed.  The place and room looks old and more like “chalet”  Had to change to another room cos there is odour in the toilet  Unable to remove the odour despite they tried washing it.  Can see lizards crawling around the room too.  During breakfast the staff at coffee lounge are nice and friendly especially Clinton Choo.  He really goes the extra miles.  Thank you"
"I booked a 3-day staycation to celebrate Hubby’s birthday and our wedding anniversary. I wrote a comment under the Remarks section, not expecting it to be read ( as per my experience with many hotels and restaurants). I was very surprised when a staff showed up with a slice of cake, candle and matches shortly after we returned to our hotel room after our evening walk. Indeed my comments were read !   I also want to compliment the hotel on the homely feel that the staff (many whom are more elderly) gave. They carried out their work well while making me feel like I’m staying at an elderly relative’s house than hotel. E.g., while having set breakfast, the serving staff would come to check and ask if we were full / need any top-up. Even the younger serving staff doing the dinner"
"If you want the new, modern hotel full of the latest gizmos, stop reading and go elsewhere.  Goodwood Park is historical but by no means a museum piece. Imagine having tea with Singapore's late Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew - truly relevant and inspiring! This property and its people will fulfill all you need for a good stay and rest.  I booked into one of their Mayfair Deluxe rooms and was given the furthest corner room on their highest floor (third floor). It is very spacious and with a balcony. All the amenities are included. It comes with a bath tub, but I am not sure if all the rooms at this wing are such. The housekeeping lady does a solid job.  Enjoyed my stay. Highly recommended."
Service staff was very nice in dining area for breakfast and we were able to provide special request to our food if needed. Part of this hotel retains their old staff which makes the service very warm for locals for their great service.  The hotel rooms are a little old for some of the rooms since we prefer bath tub rooms for a staycation feel. Still the hotel managed to give a strong historic experience and a very colonial feel given the rich history.
My worst experience of all my staycations. Given it as 5* hotel but not the services... its really a bad experience for me. Not even a smile just standard script during check in. The DM when talking to me on the phone was more like a warden then the host. No empathy at all. Maybe they feels we are just local staycationers not worth the attention of a 5* star hotel staff.😡😡😡
Love the surrounding greenery and colonial low building. The structures are beautiful. From the time step in till check out was smooth. Their customer service is great. Although the swim area is limited. The environment is a great take away. Not crowded and feel like back in time with the old walls and vines.  The rooms are definitely clean and well maintain. Comfy sleep. A nice hotel that I would stay again for birthday retreat and layback staycation.
"First off, I would like to thank the following people for an amazing proposal: 1. My fiancee 2. Myself 3. Me 4. I  On a more serious note, pre-arrival, while most helpful, it seems like the hotel took every opportunity to make an extra buck. Thankfully, I was formerly a hotelier myself, and decided to DIY all the room decorations for my proposal to my then girlfriend (current fiancee). Quite understandable given the current pandemic situation. They were definitely very accommodating in my request for an early check-in as well as to view the room 2 days before my arrival.   HOWEVER, I did observe a less hospitable Duty Manager at the front desk. Thankfully I do not recall his name, but he definitely seemed to enjoy avoiding welcoming any guests into the hotel, or generally greet"
"I’d like to start off by saying that the lady receptionist at Goodwood Hotel actually asked me to leave this bad feedback on the staff service. This was pretty questionable in itself as all I wanted was to know my feedback would be passed on to the buggy driver in question, but her exact words were ""you can leave this feedback on tripadvisor so that he may see it"". So here goes.  To be honest, they were all pretty polite and sweet from beginning to end so not shaming the entire staff in general, but the buggy driver/guy who handled our luggage completely ignored my presence and made me feel disregarded. Right off the bat, he asked for my partner’s name, how his day was going and only referred to him as he was showing us where the pools and facilities were in the buggy. ""Sir"
"Check In was smooth but during this Covid 19 period, there's a limitation on number of guest allowed.  Staff drove us to the Park Suite in a buggy  as the Parklane Suite is at another building.  Got a Split Studio with a good deal via Agoda.  Room wise, Split Studio is spacious and cozy There's washer/dryer, kitchen stove, oven etc etc. We don't really spend time in the balcony because of my child safety.   And thanks to Goodwood Mgmt, they gave us a complimentary cake for my Son's birthday and it's delicious!  Overall, it's a pleasant experience!"
"Took the 3days 2 nights staycation package called Restless in Singapore to celebrate my wedding anniversary. Checkin was a breeze and bell caption was very friendly to take our baggage and show us to the room. Room was big and clean with new furnishings. Due to pandemic, only the front entrance is accessible therefore the down side is having to walk under the hot sun to orchard road. The degustation dinner at lobby lounge was a bit small in portion but quality was good. Dinner at the newly renovated Min Jiang was excellent and they surprised us with a small piece of cake for our anniversary. Breakfast was good and overall service staffs was very friendly. I am happy to note that quite a number of service staffs are mature aged and though they may not have high energy but they"
"I made the reservation with GWP Hotel last week via the official website. I managed to spoke with Roman from the Front desk and he shared with me about the room category and the breakfast price. Roman very helpful and informative & he gave some suggestions instead you paying more for the breakfast it is much better to buy the breakfast at the desk on an actual day for check-in. Thank you, Roman.  I believe this is a great hotel with a nice ambiance for my staycation. Below here some of the great and excellent staff for assisting me during my stay.  Melanie- Front Desk  Really appreciate Melanie for giving me an opportunity to have an early check-in at 1230hrs. She also upgrades my room category plus she extended my late checkout until 1500hrs.  Rizal ( Malay Guy) - Bellman"
"We stayed for 3 nights on a Staycation offer. Checkin and 2min buggy transfer to our suite (thanks, Abdula!) were very smooth and forthcoming. We then went to the laid back of the two pools. Here, there is no direct pool service and attention could be improved (likewise for the larger pool); an order with the staff inside worked fine though.  For dinner (as part of the package), a chef cooked in our suite together with a private concierge (great job @Suresh!!! Likewise thanks to the chef - we didn’t catch the name)! We had our own wine, which they served to excellent food.  Breakfast is well presented by friendly staff. Location is just off Orchard Road. Overall, a great stay and an option for repetition! Thanks, guys :)"
"Had our wedding luncheon in October and both thumbs up to the service crew especially Viswam our banquet manager and our banquet sales manager Don. Both showed tremendous experience and knowledge. Don was very accommodating and constantly helped to arrange for any request that we had, even a few last minute requests. He had personally popped by just to make sure everything went smoothly and gave his congratulations to us.  Viswam our banquet manager for the day was very patient with us and always provided us with updates on the next sequence of events. He is always wearing a smile on his face and it is because of that smile that we felt very assured to have him as our banquet manager.   Definitely would recommend any couples to hold their wedding reception here!"
"Goodwood Park Hotel is my 2nd staycation hotel since ""SG Clean Certified"" hotels during COVID-19.   As with the first hotel staycation, the pandemic phase I/II  restrictions adds a negative damperner to an otherwise happy stay.  However, I choose to review Goodwood Park Hotel at Scotts Road because it is a ""5-star Heritage"" hotel with one negative staff attitude.  I had a room reservation for 1-night but at the reservation counter, I decided to add on an additional night.  We had a ""Deluxe Poolside Room"" that had a small patio next to the Balinese-inspired Mayfair Pool.  The whole pool area is badly in need of re-vitalizing.  The pool area is in neglect... dead leaves, unkempt, old furniture, unraveling rattan wraps on the deck loungers, unappealing... etc, etc.  I would mention"
"Was here for a staycation and was going to use the pool and chill. Had a good deal on the Parklane suites, but it was really far away from the main building. Had I known about the Hotel layout, and the Mayfair rooms and pool, I would have made other bookings.  The Parklane suites are far away and because it was raining all weekend we had to walk in the rain via a back route that was really sketchy.  We were told that a buggy could be asked to come get us to and from the building but it would have taken too long to call etc.  The room is old and smells lived in, but it was clean and the kitchen appliances seemed new and easy to use. The washer/dryer had complementary bags of detergent. We joked that it felt like an air bnb overseas, so we could see how this would be a good deal"
"Would like to take this opportunity to thank GoodwoodPark Hotel for making my Dad's Birthday Celebrations an Excellent one, Adding to Extend ,Mr Shankar & team for their enhanced service 👏 towards us ."
My first time staying at the Goodwood Park: choosing a one night stay last weekend.  Paid $192 SGD on Trip.com. Room with balcony on 2nd floor overlooking Mayfair Pool. Comfortable king size bed. Checkin at 3pm but late checkout of 2pm allowed. Friendly and courteous staff. Small bathroom with combined shower/bath. Some neighbour noise from upstairs room but was quiet during the night. Good location in central Orchard. Free WiFi worked well. Huge flat screen tv. Good quality towels. At this price point it’s very good value compared to hotels of a similar quality.
"My wife and I really needed a place to rest and replenish and I can honestly say five nights here at Goodwood Park Hotel have been one of the most memorable and pleasant stays.   All the hotel staff are highly professional and treated us with great warmth and kindness - from the time we entered the lobby, to our morning breakfasts and the impeccable high tea at the lounge. You can tell they really take pride in serving with excellence and pay much attention to the details - we were really impressed! It was no surprise that we found out many have served in the hotel for decades.   The ambience of the hotel is perfect for a staycation - we thoroughly enjoyed both swimming pools. One is nice and big for laps and the other is a cosy Balinese style pool for quiet, relaxing times."
"We just came back from a weekend staycation at the Goodwood Park Hotel.  We were attracted by the good rate offered for locals and we were curious about the duplex and in-room dinning experience.  So, eagerly we booked and I did not know what to anticipate because I did not know where the duplexes were located.  We checked in on a Friday afternoon - slightly after 2 pm.  Prior to checking in, Ms Crystal Soh, the affable Assistant Reservations Manager, communicated with me thrice.  I made a mistake in the number of pax and she wanted to confirm the menu that we would like to have for the in-room experience as the Chef would need to prepare the ingredients.  Our initial experience was less than satisfactory because the duplex was not what we had in mind.  It was more like"
The cafe service standard has improved alot. Very helpful and accommodating service team during our visit. Cafe Executive - Mr. Raymond Goh has gone the extra mile of cleaning the slippy patch on the floor to avoid slip and fall.  Good team work at the cafe.. and we will be back again
"I would like to thank the hotel staff for helping me to retrieve my mobile phone, which I had accidentally left behind in the hotel safe after checking out.  Ms Jamalia answered my wife's call and ensured that I was quickly attended to when I rushed back to the hotel to get my phone, and Mr Terence Rodriguez went the extra mile to drive me back to my room via buggy service (I believe this isn't his usual role).   It cannot be easy working in the service line during COVID-19 with all the extra requirements placed on hotel staff, but the Goodwood Park team still displayed the highest service standards. In a period when we are unable to travel overseas, I was glad to experience 1st class service at an iconic Singapore hotel. It made me feel proud to be Singaporean on National Day,"
"Nice stay for a short get away, a vintage feel away from the city's busy streets. will come back for another trip. Look out for that ""secret"" swimming pool for a good rest and relaxation. Have tea by the pool side for a great feel!"
"Booked this hotel because we thought it would be old fashioned 5 star and maybe it is, when we arrived 3rd March we were put in annexe across the road, it was spacious but shabby, when we had breakfast we came in the tradesman entrance, so was very disappointed. The staff were nice at breakfast and we had one meal at the grill would have had more if we had been staying in the hotel instead of across the road, the food in the restaurant was great. So when next in singapore wont be staying here and we will be visiting again as our trip got cut short due to the virus and foreign office recall."
"great service, excellent stay. hotel was old but beautiful and clean. The staffs are attentive especially during dining in at the various restaurant, and frequent checking if everything is ok or required further assistance."
"I loved this hotel and my first time here.  I have been to Singapore before, and would have stayed at a standard brand name place. But this hotel had great charm, great restaurant, and really personalised care - they greeted me by name every time I came back"
"The service was pretty good, but it's a pity that the room was showing it's age (not in a good way) and the breakfast was very mediocre -- for a 5-star hotel, I expected a greater variety (and better quality) of items."
It has been a wonderful experience staying the in hotel. The staff are friendly and the room are superb. Can’t wait to patronise the hotel again. Only setback is that the hotel do not provide Muslim Food.
"The overall of the food is not bad, but the service is not really hit the five star hotel standard.The staff is not so friendly, no people care about our dining satisfaction. The staff is walking around but no one pay attention to us even we raise up our hand. Additionally, no one is telling us last call for the buffet and just present the bill to us.The service of the staff should be improved and make some changes cause this is five star hotel. Its quite disappointed choosing to have our afternoon tea here...."
"I tried high tea buffet in goodwood park The food was very nice,delicious also i can refill the beverage including ice I was satisfied with that but the staff was unkind, no smile. It was disappointing point"
"Goodwood Park Hotel is a luxurious hotel situated on Orchard Road.  Staff is friendly, helpful and patient.  The lobby is bright, clean, and beautifully decorated with fresh orchids.  The Heritage room is spacious and cool, with much closet and storage space.  The study comes with a handy phone for guests to make free local calls, which turns out to be very useful.  Being able to enjoy complimentary Nespresso coffee definitely makes the stay more gratifying."
All was quite good except for the usual minor hiccups   which was the result of my personal physical condition where I am unable to walk long distances  through the lack of understanding of a new staff member I was given a room not quite up to the usual rooms i have been assigned at the hotel
The hotel is an historic building dating back over a century. It has charm and character. It has spacious rooms and spacious grounds and yet is located at the centre of Singapore's shopping district. We have stayed 3 times and would return again.
"Good Hotel and Excellent Staff, Location is very accessible with loads of good food around Check-in and check-out is very fast and the rooms are properly cleaned. Room attendant are polite and parking area is convenient."
"Getting very tired as a hotel now. From being our hotel of choice due to location, have noticed it gradually deteriorating over the years. Staff still good but fabric of building falling well behind the many alternatives on offer. Will think twice before staying there again"
"The rooms are spacious and they excel at service. We were here 8 nights and the maids service the room everyday - twice if you let them. That included at least one complete linen exchange. The breakfasts are superb with a complete variety of Chinese and North  American dishes.  We walked everywhere from the location - Little India, China Town and the Quay. If you like high end shopping, this is the area. A real treat to stay here. We did not eat here as too many other compelling places with more reasonable prices."
I have recently returned from several days at the Goodwood Park Hotel on my outward trip to New Zealand and on my return. This wonderful hotel is located close to the junction of Scotts Road and Orchard Road very close to the shops. A  traditional colonial style low rise property the rooms are extremely comfortable and the two pools ideal for a dip after a long flight. The breakfasts are delicious and taken in a beautiful room at the front of the building.The Goodwood  has a long and illustrious history. Many of the staff have worked here for over 40 years. They are very knowledgeable and incredibly helpful. The service was excellent and room which overlooked one of the pools well appointed and very large. One of the best hotels I have stayed in for a long time.
"We stay at the Goodwood Park hotel to break our journey from NZ to UK.  We have tried other hotels in Singapore  but return here.It is not the cheapest place to stay but a great place to relax  and unwind after a journey. The hotel is set in lovely grounds and not being high rise makes for a more relaxing ambience. The hotel grounds are well maintained , rooms are spacious and clean and well appointed. Staff are lovely , and efficient.  Location is about 200 yards from Orchard road which is very busy with many malls and food outlets close to an MTR .Good bus links too. Walking distance to Botanic Gardens if you are fit."
"This is a quiet and pleasant alternative to the rush and glitter of more modern establishments. It has a historic feel but not as expensive as Raffles! The staff were most helpful and the rooms were beautifully appointed and had all that was needed for a comfortable, business stay"
"So pleased that we decided to stay at the Goodwood Park Hotel. From the moment we arrived to when we left the staff at the hotel treated us as very specially indeed. The front desk staff were attentive, friendly and professional. The room was fresh, clean and very comfortable. The breakfasts were simply amazing with an wonderful collection of Asian, Middle-East and European selections.   Can't say enough about the hotel staff as they were fantastic. On our final day we booked out about 11am and they were kind allowing us to leave our luggage at the hotel. We came back around 7pm and were offered a room to freshen up in and prepare for our flight to Munich. It was at no charge. Amazing service!   Would certainly stay again."
"* Renovated room decor is soulless, incongruous with characterful hotel exterior. Didn’t feel like Singapore * Woken up & disturbed many times every day by staff ringing doorbell to ask if we had laundry (?!), if we wanted fresh towels, and to restock the minibar. Doorbells are REALLY LOUD. Very disruptive. Why can’t this all be done in one go? * Room noise-insulation is awful, can hear staff ring neighbours’ doorbells, neighbours’ TV & conversations and worst of all toilet noises. Can also hear every little noise from staff cleaning corridors.  * No magnifying mirror in the bathroom. And water pressure is anaemic * Bedside light control panel doesn’t control two lights (desk lamp & floor lamp). Why have a panel, if it doesn’t control all lights? * Common staircase landing"
"Staying at Goodwin Park Hotel was the best experience for me. Every care was taken to make sure I was comfortable. I had  beautiful bright, modern room, overlooking the main swimming pool. It had everything I could want in it, including a comfortable bed and feather and down pillows. The house keeping was excellent. From the moment I checked in until I checked out, I was treated kindly and courteously. Unfortunately, I had to have an urgent operation while in Singapore and the staff at Goodwood Park were concerned and made contact with the hospital. When I returned to the hotel, I was treated with absolute care and compassion. The management and staff went well above what I could have expected to see that all my needs were met. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and would"
"A usual, we were very satisfied with the Goodwood Park Hotel, Scotts Road. This Hotel is very well located in Singapore, next to Orchard Road. Each member of the staff takes care of our problem.  A special thanks to M. REUBEN, Chef Concierge. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with the Gordon Grill Restaurant, inside the Hotel. The welcome was so rude that we had no desire to stay there to lunch."
"All aspects of my stay at Goodwood Park Hotel were exceptional. The staff were accommodating, respectful and helpful. I was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded. The hotel room was recently refurbished. The room was spacious, great storage space, desk and ample USB charging stations. A trip to the gym didn't disappoint. Gym equipment was perfect for the holiday guest. A good range of weights, water, towels but surprisingly headphones were available for guest use. The outlook was lovely too. A delicious breakfast was served in the elegant breakfast room. A spread of continental, American and Asian inspired food. The pastries were delicious. Food was quickly replenished. Staff were efficient and unobtrusive. Coffee and tea were brought to the table. In a month of staying in various"
"My hubby and I love hotel staycation and hop around hotels at least once a month. Love the elegance and serenity of Goodwood Park where the hotel is located on the same stretch as the bustling malls while enjoying its uniqueness of quietness. We were being upgraded to a junior suite, room is cozy and comfortable. Good selection of tea and bathroom ammenities. The slight issue that we faced was that the tv in the bedroom was not facing the bed but facing the window. So, if you are laying on the bed, you would not be able to enjoy the tv programs (please see photo). Nonetheless, wasn't a major issue.   Staff were friendly and good selection of local breakfast."
"Goodwood hotel was very good hotel. I spent happy time in hotel. My son lost i phone.we were sad. But Idil and Roman manager looked for cctv and connected taxi office. Next day,taxi came and found the phone. Thank you very much Idil and Roman.breakfast menu change every day.만일 굿우드파크에서 머무신다면 멋지고 깨끗한 시설과 친절에 만족하실거에요. 다시한번 roman과.idil 매니져님의 적극적 상황대처에 감사드립니다."
"We have stayed at the Goodwood Park many times before.  The staff are friendly and the hotel is very clean and has a wonderful old world charm.  We feel that this time the hotel looked ""tired"" and in need of some maintenance."
"Very good location at Central. The staff are friendly, even though they are busy with some other work, they make priority for guess request. Thanks for the complimentary of birthday celebration. And the buffet breakfast is very good with variety of choice."
"very kind.good view,clean hotel. My son lost his phone in taxi. We thought it would be hard to find the phone back. Manager whose names were 'Idil' and 'Roman' did their best to find it as it was their phone. They were very kind and gave us fast solution. We found phone because of their quick work. Thank you. Breakfast menu changes a little everyday. It was good"
"Great historic hotel, staff are great and extremely helpful, great facilities, with kitchen, laundry machines, and great location.  We had a wonderful time.  We got a detailed walking tour through the original building which had a long history.  Also when we check out, we got great help from Nathan."
"Perfect location. Just 5 minutes walk to the main Malls in Orchard Road. Spacious room, good warm water flow with stable temperature for shower or bath. Nice breakfast with lots of choice. There is a very nice swimming pool on the side wing surrounded by lush of greenery."
"the hotel is a nice and good place, it is near the shopping center Scotts Road & Orchard Road by walking clean room and bath room very quiet and make me sleep tight good food at the breakfast time and friendly staff"
Good hotel with good staff. Make the stay more memorablee with the attitude of the staffs that are very attentive during our stay and make it easier for us during our stay and not make it a hassle during our stay.
We stayed in the split-level studio which was very spacious and well-equipped. Staff were brilliant from check-in to check-out; very accommodating of our requests and carrying out their duties cheerfully. Decent spread on offer for breakfast.
"When we choose a hotel we usually look for 5 to 6 things: 1. location  2. 4-5 stars and value for money 3. history or a strong connection to the past 4. a good sized room with a king bed 5. a great swimming pool, 6. good service. The Goodwood Park has all of these and more! We previously stayed at Raffles prior to its renovation and this time decided to head back to one of our all time favourites the Goodwood Park Hotel on our way back from Kuching.   The Goodwood Park is located within walking distance of Orchard MRT, Tang Plaza; It's a colonial style hotel - or rather a mixture of Victorian and German architectural influences being the former Tuetonia Club for expat Germans in the mid 1850s.  It's famous tower block built in 1900 was added to the List of National Monuments in"
"The staffs are all very courteous and helpful as they have answered my queries with satisfaction. The place is nice. The pools, gym and dining areas are all well-maintained and nice. The hotel location is also very strategic as it is located 5 mins walk to the MRT station in the centre of Singapore."
"My hubby and I just returned from our staycation to celebrate wedding anniversary at the Goodwood Park hotel. We are Glad that upon calling the front desk, Ms Sha, made special provisions for us to check in early and check-out later as per our earlier request. The concierge, Mr Idil was very helpful and friendly. He brought us to our room, entertaining us with the history of the hotel and explaining the various facilities available. We were delighted to have a yummilicious cake delivered to doorstep by Steven to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was indeed a wedding anniversary to be remembered!"
"We shopped around for an affordable 5 star hotel in Singapore and Goodwood Park certainly fit the bill. Everything was really good from the location to the amenities to service.  The only hiccup that prevents this place from receiving an enthusiastic 5 out of 5 was one young front desk staff member.  We asked him to send someone to help with our aircon in the room and he smiled slyly and said he would send someone up immediately.  He never asked our room number and I walked back and said “don’t you need our room number?”  He smiled and said he had forgotten. Needless to say, no one was sent to assist us.  Other than this one issue, it was a very nice accomodation."
"I like stay in GWPH ,location very good,easy if i want to go everywhere and any time and in room very complete anythink,wash machine and pantry and etc ,i like stay in parklane split.if i go to singapore i am sure to stay in GWPH again,Thank you GWPH."
I've stayed Goodwood Park several times.  It's located in the busy Orchard area but still quiet inside.  A lot of trees invite birds and squirrels.  It's nice to have coffee at the balcony in the morning.  I like their pool too.  They have 2 pools but mayfair is more quiet and relaxing in the back.  I'd recommend this hotel if you like colonial style even though a bit old.  This hotel isn't for high-rise hotel lovers.
Wonderful stay. Nice rooms and great food. Historical hotel and well equipped facilities. Well to just open the room windows and chill by the coffee table. Offers very nice tea in the room and very clean toilets.
Location is great being just off Orchard Rd and easy to get to from the airport using the wonderful Singapore transit system. Second oldest hotel in city so some style to it rather than the usual glass and steel of modern hotels. However the hotel still benefitted from nice modern facilities and spacious bedrooms and bathroom. Nice public areas and outside areas with 2 pools. Had a couple of meals and they were very good and reasonably priced. Excellent and friendly service from all the staff. The location is great for the many shops and malls along Orchard Rd and for access to the tourist sites around the city. All in all very happy and would definitely return.
"Stayed there again 7 years after a 8 week stay in their apartments. The hotel is old by Singapore standards but luxurious; comfortable & friendly; excellent food. Staff are helpful and courteous and unlike the big corporate hotels in the Financial district, you see the same staff on a regular basis."
"Lovely Hotel in a great location. Excellent staff and great service. We have stayed previously and it is our preferred Hotel in Singapore. Close to Orchard Rd, it is recommended as good value for the quality of rooms and facilities."
It's a very calm hotel. The hospitality of the staff was really pleasant. Problems such as facilities may be written on various travel sites. But they seemed to be repaired and there was a sense of trust.
"Overall, Goodwood Park was a huge disappointment. The lobby, pool courtyard and rooms were all plain rather than elegant and really did not match up to the ornate exterior. Breakfast was fine - above average. What really coloured my experience was a brush with one of the waiting staff in the lobby lounge. Most tables were reserved (as for reason it is a favourite for tea with people) but we were sat at one that was not waiting for our cake order to arrive. We were so rudely moved out of it by a waiter who told us it, too, was reserved. When I pointed there was no sign, he said that a sign on an adjacent table applied to this table as well!!! Then we were moved into a hidden empty bar where service took an eternity because we were out of sight. Definitely would not go back."
I celebrated my boyfriend's birthday at hotel Parklane suite. The stay is very quiet and resort like even though it is location in city. Of course not to mentioned the hotel prepared a complimentary birthday cake surprise for us as well as late check out so that we can have lunch in the hotel before we check out. Very accommodating and welcoming hotel. Will definitely be back to stay with them again.
"My mother and I stayed at this beautiful hotel earlier this year. I have been to Singapore more than twenty times, and this is my favourite hotel! The rooms are comfortable and quiet, the gardens are lush and tropical, and the breakfast buffet offers a wide range of food to suit everyone! It was delicious! We loved our morning chats with Betty who works there! She is the best host! The concierge staff were also fantastic. They were so helpful and gave us some great tips for restaurants in Little India. They made sure our stay in the hotel was first class.  This hotel boasts a lovely old world charm and the staff make you feel like family. We will definitely being staying here on our next trip! Thank you for a charming and wonderful stay!  Tamara"
"My husband and I held our wedding at Goodwood Park Hotel on the 17th November 2019. It was a splendid and magnificent wedding celebration. All our guests whom attended our big day that day had nothing but praises for our wedding ceremony. I would like to highlight the excellent services being provided by Goodwood Park Hotel, especially the excellent teamwork led by Don and his team. Don has been a very helpful wedding coordinator to us since we decided to sign with the hotel a year ago. He was patient in explaining the terms and conditions to us and has offered tremendous help to us along the way. He has accommodated to all of our requests and even assist personally to help us in the decoration process. On our actual day, he was actually present throughout to ensure the smooth"
"Great servicing, good location, very convenience and room is very clean with good foods Gym is open 24 hrs with friendly staff, ease to walk to metro and shopping area, value to money. Highly recommended."
"The Goodwood Park Hotel is a quiet oasis directly next to the bustle of shopping and restaurants near Orchard Road.  The rooms are spacious, well appointed, and quiet with efficient AC. The two pools offer a way to cool down between shopping and eating. Best of all, the staff is fantastic - welcoming and professional.  The afternoon tea is delightful - a wide array of sweet and savory offerings with attention to detail."
"Upon arriving at the Goodwood Park Hotel I felt like I was stepping back in time.  This beautiful building is such a treasure when most 5 star hotels in cities are large tall buildings.  The Goodwood has two very large pools, a number of dining options.  We enjoyed the dim sum lunch on offer.  Service here was exceptional.  We stayed for 6 nights.  Next time I travel to Singapore I will certainly stay again."
"We came here at the end of a long trip, and the poolside suite was everything we could have hoped for. The beds are comfortable, the nespresso machine well stocked and there was even little capsules of milk in the fridges ,a detail many other hotels miss.  Highly recommended and we will stay here next time we are in Singapore."
"We want to stay at Raffles however it was still under renovations . Fullerton was completely booked .  We chose this regal hotel for our 10 day stay visiting family and friends. It's centrally located to Orchard Rd. where you can walk around sample the local cuisine , shopping , entertainment , the clubs brought back some memories, etc.   We enjoyed a number of meals at the hotel's restaurant . Ming Jian and The Thai House were our favourites .  The staff were friendly !  Our suite at the rear by the pool was a tropical retreat  ! Enjoyed a few Tiger beers soaking up some sun .    It will be difficult to choose our accommodations during our next visit."
"There are so many nicer hotel in Singapore with the same price range but I liked to stay here because small, cozy and staff were very nice.  Facilites is old and rather small compare to other hotels but more feel like home."
"Conveniently located in Orchard area, which made me an ideal choice for both business and leisure in Singapore.  I will likely be back to this hotel when I travel to Singapore sometime in the future.  Thank you for your hospitality."
"Staying at Parklane Suite was a horrible experience. Website states no party but neighbours were making much noise even at midnight. No hotel staff were patrolling. Cigaratte smell came in through front door and lingered in the room the whole night, resulting in flu and throat infection for my pregnant wife. Found cockroaches in the room as well. Please avoid booking parkland suites. The rooms in the main building are much better."
