"Booked this staycation using the SGRV. A few hits and misses about this hotel:   Let’s talk about the good things first:   - Early check-in – Take note to book your check in slot online. There is no notification from Klook to do so. Happened to view the M Social website and saw the check in reservation link. Booked the check in slot for 12pm, and the room was ready when we arrived at 12pm.  - Room was generally clean and the bed was comfy but small (see misses below).  - Standard hotel items e.g. hair dryer, bathrobes, bath slippers, and toiletries were provided. Tea and coffee were also provided, with a kettle.  - Value for money – after utilising the SGRV, we paid only $118 for the room, so cannot really complain but thought I should give me honest feedback on the ‘misses’ so"
"Gretchen and her team made my proposal possible with their flexibility and attentiveness to detail. I had some doubts about how the decorations will look and Gretchen's replies are not only prompt but also detailed, coupling descriptions with pictures. She and her team also accommodated to my request for receiving the flowers and placing them together with the towel swan/rose petals decoration.   My proposal was only made possible by Gretchen and her team. Thanks guys! i will definitely be here again :)"
"when I was booking a short stay, I looked through reviews and it seemed like a nice place. To my surprise, the room was very dark, and  most importantly not very clean, there were stains on the bed, the bedsheets and pillowcases were tearing apart, the shower had hair and mold all over. It was quite noisy as well, seemed like a bunch of teenagers booking the rooms to have parties. Not a nice to place for almost $400 for 2 nights, overpriced, won't recommend it at all."
"Attended this perfume making workshop. It was interactive and interesting workshop which allows you to smell different kinds of perfume. You are allowed to mix and match to ur preferred smell. If you need help to decide on your choices, the coordinator is most welcome to assist you. I have a hard time deciding on my choices and the coordinator help me by asking more on me and customize it based on my description. Kudos to the coordinator. The workshop is confirmed worth to attend"
"Location wise, CBD area so the price quite ex for a room that small. Room itself was small but got that cosy feeling and comfortable enough to chill. Not typical design for the room as its high arch style, mirror design beside the bed which was kinda different too"
"Booked m social due to the perfume workshop available & was not disappointed at all! Novelia was so patient with us & we had our customised concoctions in no time! Although the process of getting to the pool was a tad tedious, good stay overall I would say"
"Having stayed here before covid and then just a couple of months ago, we had good experiences so far. Until this stay. After checking in to our room, to discover that robe were not stocked, and the room had NO TOILET PAPER!  Wow, for a reputable boutique brand that was unbecoming.    Then morning breakfast was a surly staff followed by tea served with teabag thrown in (with the string and all) and hot water just poured on. See attached photo.  Seriously, occupancy is not that great right now, so such ridiculous lapses should be far far from happening right?!?"
"Stay at M Social during the school holiday period to celebrate my wife birthday for 2 nights from 15/3/21 - 17/3/21 in room 212. I called the hotline on the actual day asking for a simple birthday decoration. Room Reservation Defanie answered and greeted my call nicely and she put me on hold to check on my request. However, as per her colleague told her that I must request the decoration to be 3 days in advance. Nontheless, Receptionist Syafiq gave me a call back and full-filled my request to inform the housekeeping to set the last minute decoration and he played along with me upon checked in to not asking for the decoration charges $15++ infront of my wife as it was meant to be a surprise. Thank you Syafiq and housekeeping, for the decoration. Another thing was the room comes"
"This is my first ever complaint at any service establishment; I feel that it is necessary to alert the management to the particularly intentionally contemptuous behaviour of one staff member I had the displeasure of dealing with. I have no problems with M Social and the rest of the staff were pleasant and welcoming. I had my second stay at M Social Singapore from 24-25 March 2021 in room 468, for my birthday staycation. I had ordered food delivery and I called the front desk to request for some cutlery. A lady answered and told me that the cutlery would be sent up. After 25 minutes the cutlery hadn't been received and the food had gone cold, to which I called the front desk again. Shafiq Bin Senen picked the phone up. Upon hearing my request, which I put across politely, I was"
"Was a great staycation for us and M Social were pretty much different compare to other hotels/resort as they do offer some workshops you can sign up for during your stay, which pretty much added some colours to the typical staycay. You get to learn and have fun! We chose the 3d2n inclusive of perfume and cocktail workshops which was really bang for the buck and also get to try something new! Novelia was our perfume workshop and she’s very nice and patience and was also professional at her work when she helped us out on giving suggestions and options of the scents we may like! All and all it was a good experience first time being there!"
Went with my girlfriend. It was great fun being able to mix from a huge selections of essences into a bottle of perfume to my preferences. Guide Novella was helpful and engaging and helped us through the experience when our noses gave up and couldn't distinct the different scents anymore.
"My partner planned my birthday staycay which happened over the last weekend and experienced such bad customer service from the reservation team to swear he will not be back. Better if you choose its competitor which also offers loft room.  As he engaged a vendor to decorate the room, he asked the team about check-in procedure. But kept receiving generic / robotic responses which were not helpful at all. After many back & forth, the team finally suggested him to check in at around 1+pm on the day, which is understandable as it depends on the hotel's occupancy rate that day. But when the vendor checked into the room at 1.30pm, my partner was shown photos of an uncleaned room (sink was filthy amongst other areas).  When it was time for me to check in, there was long queue at the"
"I like one of the Malay guy staff who assisted us upon check-in. He were so friendly, and humble. Easy and fun to talk to. He makes our checked-in process smoothly, and happy for a start! This is our third time staying in this hotel. Looking forward to stay here again anytime!"
"We booked a Mixology Rate which included a cocktail making session with Vlad the Bartender. What an interesting guy. Now when I hear the name Vlad I think of cocktails instead of blood. The session was eye opening, providing some basic knowledge of how bartenders mix cocktails. I was pretty pleased with how my mixture turned out and enjoyed it after the session was over together with my dinner. The cocktail shaker that was part of the package was out of stock on the day we stayed so that was a bit disappointing. I was informed at check out it would be mailed out when they have restocked but after almost two months, it still has not arrived. Will it be mailed out soon?  Apart from this, the rest of the stay was enjoyable. However, the room and gym were both a bit small though."
"We had chosen M Social for a 3 days 2 nights staycaution. In the orginial booking booking we had only booked 1 night however we decided to book another extra night. As it was a last min booking for the  friday night we can't get the standard loft room and I just book a  Premium loft room, thinking we can sort it out later.  Upon checking  in , I spoken to the front desk on the issues I had with the booking. As both type of rooms wasn't too far of the price range, I was hoping for an upgrade on the Thursday night. I was rather surprised that he offer to charge me extra  $23 instaed of the $30++ for the update. This is a special discount cos it is my birthday.   I was speachless for the above special discount I gotten. I wonder, if he will had advise me to check out and check in"
"Good experience at the perfume workshop. Novelia was detail orientated and friendly throughout the whole process ^^ despite the wide variety of scents provided, Novelia very patiently helped us to look for the ideal scent that fit me. Overall, a fun and pleasant experience."
"Was quite upset with the concierge service.  During Check-in: - Queue was super long and not sure if they will do late check out for us. (Only 2 counters open for check in) - Arrived at 3.30pm but I can only get my room at 4.25pm which is almost an hour! - Booking confirmation shown to the PRC lady (concierge) but still ask who did the booking~ Duh?  During a few hours of my stay: - Rooms are pretty good - My room card cannot be tapped into the Swimming pool/Gym, went to the concierge again to ask for the access. Access was given to the pool/gym but...... I am unable to go back to my room level....  - I am not sure why the guy at the concierge ask me again how many guest I have when my guest are all registered.  This is a birthday gift from my friends but I am experiencing a"
"Had a great time finding my personalize scent with my wife. A quick 1hr session with a whole array of scents to pick, Novelia was super helpful and friendly, and an expert in finding the right combination for you to love. Went home with my own bottle, ready for my next date night! Will recommend!"
"We stayed for one night in the Loft Premier Room.   Pros - Room was really modern and comfortable. Front desk service was great, special thanks to Jasmine for helping us with a room upgrade and complimentary breakfast!  Cons - I feel like the overall customer service is slightly slower than other places, which might be because they're a smaller hotel. We asked for one set of cutlery which took 30-40 minutes to arrive after they said they would send it to our room.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would come back again!"
We had a great staycation experience from check in to check out. Guest Relations Manager Mariia was very patient and assisted with all our queries. A complimentary room upgrade was a special gesture that made our stay more memorable! My last minute request to arrange a bottle of champagne for my friend's special birthday was done with efficiency. I received the link to make a payment and the room was ready with a birthday card. It was overall a nice and fantastic stay!! Thanks to Mariia and her team :)
"I booked a stay at M Social for Valentine’s Day since due to COVID-19, travel is permitted. As Singapore is a really small country, most couples would have opted for a staycation to celebrate the day but somehow the hotel can be unprepared for this day as check in took more than 2 hours! We had to wait in line outside of the hotel lobby while 2 staff check us in at the door. Instead of just giving us the keys to our room, they were only allocating room numbers. We then had to queue again in the lobby to the actual front desk to get our keys.   At the front desk, I was then informed that my surprise was not done in the room. I requested 3 weeks ago for rose petals and an animal towel to be placed in the room for $15++ which I agreed via email. The staff who replied me, Daphne,"
Wife booked a staycation to celebrate V-Day. Was excited but first impression driving into an unlit carpark was already a downer. The lights were out and the lots were narrow with multiple columns.  Took the lift down to lobby and was with a scene from a refuge center with a long queue and makeshift tables for check-ins / outs. There were no clear signages and or staff on hand for crowd control. We had to ask around where to check in.  We are still in the queue after 30 mins and it does not look like we will get checked in soon. There is no arrangements at all for the elderly in the queue or any offer of water or drinks. Very unpleasant even before we checked in.
The design of the room is good as picture. Their workteam are helpful and cheerful.  Thanks for the peaceful night provided. Strongly recommend this hotel to youngsters who love party or stay alone for long weekends.
The design of the place was just so cozy and my girlfriend and I had a really great time. It is located in a really good spot with a lot of bars and other attractions fir for young couples. The staff were also attentive and welcoming and guided us with all the checking in and out. They even extended our stay till 1pm. All in all we enjoyed our stay and we’d come back again!
"It's my first staycation of the year, and I had been eyeing M Social's Mix-and-Stay package for the longest time! Really looked forward to this whole staycay, though right from the start, it appeared the hotel was running late and my room wasn't yet ready when I checked in at the stipulated time of 3pm. Had to wait another 40 minutes for it.  Regardless, I got my Loft Gallery room right at the end of the corridor -- Room 213 --which I believe gives me an extra bit of window around the corner that faces the Robertson Quay street!  And as much as I truly enjoyed myself, there are some points I think the hotel staff should note.  Because on close inspection, the room really could do with some serious overall maintenance. That bit of extra window at the corner I talked about has"
"The counter staff were approachable and friendly. Our Loft Gallery room was very well-furnished, and the shower was great. This was a steal, and the complementary breakfast at Beast & Butterflies was worthwhile as well. Great choice for our staycation overall!"
Front desk staffs were very friendly. And I'm very grateful that they allowed late check-out until 1pm.  Thankyou so much. Room was clean and beautiful. Would deff be back to stay again with my family and explore different rooms.
"“CS Shafiq from the front desk was really kind and willing to attend any request. Appreciate his thoughtfulness by giving my wife a complimentary birthday treat” Alongside good amenities and general comfort of the room, an efficient staff that excels at personal attention is a must-have for all hotels. Thumbs up👍👍"
"Shout out to Geraldine from the front desk. She was really sweet to us during our stay and the general hotel staff was very professional, helpful and cheerful, always greeting us with a smile.  The restaurant staff were all very on the ball and servicd oriented. The food was pretty good too.  Our cocktail workshop conducted by Vlat was a brief and short workshop (about 1hr) but was extremely fun and engaging.  The room albeit a little small but the high ceiling expanded the space and cleanliness was on point. We opted out of house keeping and gained a late check out. Will definitely come back again!"
snagged a 3d2n deal with klook and were lucky we didn't face any major problems. arrived at 1++pm to check-in and thankfully the queue wasn't that long. it was an okay wait time to get our keys.  alcove cosy room is really cosy - small but it was good enough. a little odd that the sink was outside the toilet haha. location is great - lots of cafes nearby.  breakfast was okay. menu for ala carte buffet is limited. the first breakfast we went near 9am and had to wait quite awhile for food to be served but didnt have to wait to be seated.  didnt use the facilities but overall enjoyed lazing in the room. the cocktail workshop was a nice additional experience! would return again but book a bigger room next time.
"Im so happy with my frens stay in M sosial,this is my 1st time stay here,the swimming pool also very nice.overall is good hotel, i strongly recommend this hotel.Service room also excellent,i like to  thank housekeeper paramas after i check in few minutes she come and ask is everything ok in the room.so sweet of her."
"Everything’s great ... the staff , the food, everything ..   Except the check in Q.  Holding area for check in is outdoor ... it was a holiday ... so we were expecting a Q indoor.. with proper ventilation...  That said .. we love our loft room... with this bed upstairs.. the pillow is firm .. we Eliot like a baby..  Our triple treat dinning package, which we had to go to 3 different restaurant in 3 different hotel is totally value for money ...  A unique experience..."
"I often go on monthly staycations in Singapore as a local. M Social happened to be one of those hotels that I have yet to experience. I should have listened to my gut instincts.  Stayed for 1 night from 20-21 Dec, on my birthday with a friend. Because of the recent govt initiative that provided locals voucher incentives to explore Singapore attractions, including hotels, the long waiting time made news. During the pre-registration check-in given via email, I selected the 11am-12pm registration slot. Arrived at around 11am at the registration table at the entrance & given a ticket & was allowed to store our baggage. We were pleasantly surprised to be given a call at 12.30pm that a room was ready. Returned at 2.30pm to discover a 7m line of people waiting. But with the ticket, we"
"Stayed at this hotel for 2nights staycation.  Plus Points first: Very good hardware used in the hotel, good furnishings, from bed to shower. Very good.  Special shoutout to Housekeeping staff: Mr Ken Rock for being so friendly and helpful despite his busy schedule to make up the rooms for the next batch of guests.  Now the bad points, bear with me:  Frontdesk staff is cold and lack basic customer service skills. The choice of words and the way you say it makes a lot of difference. E.g. It was drizzling and we need to borrow umbrella, we approach the frontdesk, she said can take it ""over there"", pointing to the entrance, could have walked us there or smile and say it.  When we approached the umbrella rack to borrow, we told bluntly : one room, one umbrella. You could have said"
"It was a couple retreat cum birthday celebration, yet a big surprise given at 1am and there was a power shutdown till 4am and all of us woken due to suffocating room.  I believe it was a memorable moment, and thought the shutdown could happen in between 1 to 4am and what make no sense that if you are going to be performing such power outage shutdown it doesn’t make any senses that to bring in customers to suffer for the night, and why at the first place you are selling your hotel rooms during the date of power disruption?  How will hotel allow such mismanagement that tarnish with bad reviews.  There are no replies on the action that they supposed to answer and we are demanding compensation and would not recommend to stay at this hotel anymore if I such review is not heard by the"
"Worst decision ever made in the year 2020 - choose M Social Singapore hotel for our 10 years anniversary staycation.   Got slapped by this power shutdown exercise notice few hours after checking in. We were not informed at all before booking this hotel.   Headed over to seek solution with duty manager (named Maria) and she said the only thing we can do is to check out immediately.   Well played, really well played M Social Singapore . There goes our game night.   For those who are thinking to come here for staycation, think twice. They can suggest you to check out any time.  Now i have to worry about how to sleep without air con in a confined space tonight"
"Mixed feelings about our stay. Nice touches: - bathrobes provided - care pack of hand sanitizer, mouthwash and 2 masks - unique tea choices - motion-sensor switch for bathroom - mini fridge with see-through door. At a glance, we know if we left anything behind in the fridge.   Can be improved: - long check-in queue (similar experience to some other reviewers)  - somewhat disappointed that our reservation does not include breakfast - no one picked up our calls to M-bassador & front desk when we needed to change a spoilt light bulb. In the end, we told the front desk on our way out in the morning. Thank you for changing the bulb while we were out.  - a shelf and additional hooks would be useful for the bathroom  - for some unknown reason, the tv switches off by itself - the shower"
"Stayed on a weekday in December. Hotel was surprisingly crowded, not sure if it was because it is holiday season and Singaporeans are just desperate for a short getaway.  Check in/our: Check in time was 2pm.  We came around 3.45pm and the queue for check in was still stretched into the outdoor car porch. This took 45 minutes total which was a total bummer/bad first impression already when all we did at the counters was verify our IDs, sign for our room keys and make payment. All that could’ve been done electronically (minus the issuance of keys) to cut the wait time in my opinion.  Otherwise, check out was fuss free. Just unfortunate that we could not check out later.  Room requests:  We made our booking 2 months in advance with requests for our bed to be on the upper level."
"When we arrived an hour before check-in time, the queue has began to form. Yet throughout the check-in procedure, we found the staff friendly and patient. The bed and pillows were great for a comfy sleep. Like the idea of the wash basin built in the Alcove Cosy room rather than in the squeezy bathroom. Wish there was some form of door-stop available as we need to keep holding the door everytime we go in and out of the toilet.  A la carte buffet breakfast was great as there were ample enough variety. The kaya toast was my favourite. Clearly, the restaurant was short handed and some of the food we ordered did not arrived and we have to re-order. Yet, the female restaurant supervisor continued to provide friendly service overall. The outdoor pool is nice for a cool dip but lacked a"
"Overrated. I keep seeing people rave about this hotel, thats why I booked it. But the design is just okay. Room and bathroom is small. Bed not comfy. Not many amenities. Expensive and not worth for the price paid."
"Stayed there last Friday’s night. The queue to check in was  very long. We were disappointed when we learnt that there were no complimentary parking. The room is small and the bed is smaller (not even a Queen size). The pillows are square shaped. Not comfortable to sleep in. The check out time was 11 am which was earlier than many other hotels. For the price of $200 plus, there are better valuable options elsewhere."
I am annoyed by the servicecrew before I checked in. He insisted that i have to stay at the lobby and wait .totally disappointed. He mentioned that my friends cannot visit my room as a guest. No valid reason is given to me.
"Last week I stay at M Sosialhotel,I need extra bath towel many time cal front desk nobody answer, than I open my door see anyone outside suddenly I show 1lady her name is Paramas from hskp,I ask help with her,so kind of her she help me,same more she ask anything u need ma’am,she spoke very friendly and happy face greeting me,I really very disappointed after Front desk  never answer my call,,after I spoke to Paramas really I feel relax,,because she give me good service,I really appreciate her,,,I really want come back again n stay,"
"Everything else was not bad, but it’s hard to give a fairer review after the check-in we had to go through. It took us about 2 hrs in a queue that stretched outside the hotel and almost out the car park. Some of the guests before us didn’t even have their rooms ready. From the other reviews I see that this has been an issue for a while - why has there not been a solution? Is this actually a COVID-safe practice when you are cramming pretty much your entire guest list for the night in the one space?"
They dont care. They only want to cut costs. 1 super long queue to check in. Unacceptable. Avoid like the plague. They are not interested to serve you. There was simply not enough staff to serve you in spite of the fact tt they have had the same problem for weeks.
"We were happy that we got the early check in/late check out. We love the room and cleanliness however we were looking forward to stay in loft room since we brought our 2kids at the very last minute. Also, it was quite difficult to get through their operator or front desk for room request. We either had to wait 20minutes or to keep calling just to request things we need in the room. Overall, its a good place for young couples and friends but not for family traveller."
"Second visit to this hotel. Stayed in the Premier Loft Gallery for the first time. Well-designed loft room with nespresso machine and capsules. The loft was spacious and thoughtfully layout. Sofa was comfortable and wide enough for watching television. I like the ease of use of Apple Airplay to mirror the screen from IPAD to the tv. Understand the design of the table but the material meant that it is easily scratched and scratches are evident on the table legs and top. One should also be careful when climbing up the stairs to the loft as the bottom steps can easily be missed if one is not careful.   Overall, I am impressed with the room and the service especially the smiling housekeepers who came to check on my room to find out if everything is okay."
"Booked this package for our 5 years Wedding Anniversary. Initially wife was abit upset as she thought some of the things were not communicated properly like parking, check in and also items in the package.   However, the effort and service from the staff more than make up for it. The staff were friendly( even when faced with a daunting long queue of customers waiting to check in), kept their cool and professionalism.  One guy was going along the queue offering cold water and ice cream to those in line! Granted I waited about 35 mins to get to the check in counter which could be improved ( maybe with an app for people to pre-populate guest info, credit card, etc or staggered check in times for different rooms/packages. ) Thanks Andrew for the friendly check in and follow up"
"I am currently here waiting for our queue to check in. Currently, it's 421pm and the queue is very long. We've been waiting for more than 30 minutes already and we assume it will take us another *atleast* hour to reach the counter. The queue is almost not moving.  When you check in at a hotel, first impression starts during the check in. It should be as smooth as it could be. This is clearly mismanaged and slow service for customers who would like to have a staycation.  No one would even offer you drinks or something and we are all standing. Our feet will then be very tired before we finally get to ""relax"".  Really terrible."
Poor cleanliness this time during my visit.  Picture 1) short n medium length hair underneath the bed sheet   Picture 2) blood stains on the quilt   Picture 3) yellow stains in the fridge   Quite surprised to see the cleanliness standard has dropped. :(
"We booked the hotel for a 3D2N staycation during the Covid-19 period. The location of this hotel is very far from the nearest MRT station. At least a 15-20 mins walk under the hot sun. It take about 30 mins walk to Clarke quay. There are a lot of restaurants along the Singapore River, so food isn’t a problem. Check in was rather time consuming. Our rooms stank of cigarettes and we had no idea why because this hotel is supposed to be smoke free. The rooms were tiny but luckily the ceiling was high so it wasn’t that bad. The toilet was extremely small and the sink was outside with the bed, which was very strange. I can’t imagine how dirty the toilet door handle is if everyone had to poop and exit to wash their hands in the room. The pillows were square pillows, not very"
"Great environment for a staycation! Very relaxing, great pool environment, and overall a very pleasant experience. Even though it was for 1 day, the environment really made ne put all my worries and frustrations away 👍"
"Stayed from 26-28Nov in a Loft Premier room. Check in was rather pretty quick despite a long queue. Staff was very friendly and I had a medium sized birthday cake bought for another couple of my friends checking in later on, and had requested the staff to kept it in their fridge which they obliged happily.   Room was alright. Small but clean. **Tip, if you go to the toilet frequently at night, I will suggest that you don't book a loft room as the bed is upstairs and the washroom is downstairs. I had the free cocktail making session that day that I checked in. Fiona who is the assistant manager was the bartender teaching us the basics of cocktail making. A very interesting and knowledgeable session. Kudos to Fiona for her cheerful, friendly and enthusiastic character in making"
"Absolutely enjoyed my stay, the room was very cosy and small but not suffocating, comes with a balcony. Very high ceilings and long panelled windows to allow ample sunlight to shine through. TV is a smart TV that allows both apple and android phones to connect and mirror. You can even watch netflix on the TV using chrome cast. Only downside of the hotel is that it doesn't come with free parking, and parking overnight will cost a bomb. So i suggest to just grab there.. Breakfast at beast and butterflies was simple, I would love to have more selection than the current menu.  Overall very good experience with M social, and its inexpensive. Would stay there again 👍"
"Such a cosy place for a staycation. The staffs were so friendly and helpful. Thanks to Mr. Shafiq for the highest floor room and wedding anniversary F&B gift voucher. Also, thanks to Ms Gretchen for the very smooth checkout with a smiling face🥰."
"I stayed in one of the loft style rooms which was clean and had a layout that was conducive for working which I appreciated as I was on a working staycation. The bed was comfortable. The room was quite dark but had a large window that helped to offset that issue.  However my overall stay was not positive. My shower was freezing cold despite me setting it to the hottest temperature and giving it extensive time to heat up. Due to COVID room service was not running. You have to order your food off of a QR and then collect it from the restaurant and it takes  an hour minimum for the food to be ready for collection. Additionally, only a small part of the menu is available to order from your room and no beverages at all. I had specifically check to see if room service was available"
Stayed here for the 2nd time. Actually love everything on this room EXCEPT FOR THE BED.   1) bed is small for 2 person???????? 2) only have 2 freaking pillows!!  Thats the only thing i hate about m social. I love the hotel but dont like the bed. So........ ya.
"We booked 2 rooms for one night. The rooms and bathrooms are very small.   We didn't use the facilities. It would have been better if they let us book the facilities. Instead, we were told to change and go to the lobby to try our luck as the pool can only accommodate 20 people.   There was a small welcome pack in one room but not the other. There were towels in only one of the rooms.   We called the front desk and it took 13 mins before someone answered the call.   I was told that it would be around $17 for overnight parking. I parked at the parking lots at the hotel entrance. I was shocked when I tried to exit.The parking was $71.50. When I asked the hotel staff, I was told that those parking were for the condo.  I didn't see any sign.  Anyway, the hotel staff were very cold"
"Checked out this morning and had to leave a review of our wonderful first stay with M Social!   Service: read about the long queues and long waiting time to check in but I guess we got lucky because the whole experience was such a breeze from entrance to room. Greeted at the door by very friendly, very cheerful staff (but you can tell they are quite exhausted and jaded - probably from all the poor guests’ attitudes meh). We booked a klook deal so dude at check-in even ran to grab the heavy Bruno hotplate box from the room. While we appreciated his rushing to see us through the check-in and collection process quickly, we hope that the staff wouldn’t have to endanger themselves in the process. Last thing we want is for someone to fall down and hurt themselves.   Service at Beast &"
"Prior to arrival, I asked for early check-in as I needed to setup the room for a surprise. Understood the policy of standard 2Pm check in and early check-in is subject to availability. I arrived at 11.30am, the kind receptionist outside put me on queue list, telling me that they will call me once the room is ready. At 1.30pm, I went up to the another gentleman at the reception to check if my room was ready, only then he went through the system to find a room for me. After check-in, I needed some hand towels to fold towel art as part of my surprise hence I went to the attendant in the corridor to ask him for 6, to which he only gave me two as he said he didn’t have enough, telling me to call down for more. I called down and ask for 4, the Runner handed me 2. As I was in a hurry"
"3 days/ 2 nights stay. I must say that the location is great ! Explored around Robertson Quay & there’s a lot of food options. However, service can be much improve/ house keeping staffs are friendly but counter staffs are all very transactional. We requested for an upgrade if available via email earlier due to my anniversary however, staff didn’t acknowledge that during check in until I asked. She mentioned that all the rooms are fully booked & I understand it’s subject to availability but I would appreciate if staffs could take note of these details during check in and not ignore the requests. Rooms are small but functional. & do not expect too much services for what you pay. And they would not accommodate your late check out at 3pm (most of the hotels do so during covid"
"Extremely small room, 19m² to be exact! Room is also very dimly lit plus it's so close to the apartment opposite that you can see exactly what laundry is hanging out on their balcony once u draw back the curtains! Thus for privacy sake, curtains had to be drawn throughout stay, making the whole experience claustrophobic.  Many of the sockets are giving way, couldn't even properly charge the phone or plug in the iron. Far from public transport yet no free parking. Parking is expensive so if you drive, be prepared to pay. Not worth the money at all. For the price, just top up a bit and you can get a much better option elsewhere. Definitely will not be staying at any of the Millennium hotels again"
Was greeted by a very friendly staff called Geraldine who was Super helpful and friendly. Emphasised that she wants us to enjoy and have fun :) she created a very good first impression of Social M. Thank you Geraldine!
"Visited a best friend of mine for her birthday in September and was greeted by Geraldine again! Really amazing that she recognized myself and my boyfriend from our last stay. She greeted us with excitement though it was a busy day at work for her. We were given complimentary drink vouchers and a dessert from the restaurant by Geraldine. We could not thank her enough for taking good care of my bestfriend on her birthday.  What stood out most about the service here is the ""attention to detail"", on point! Once again thank you very much to Geraldine and the team! A true star player!"
"Stayed in their rather small loft. There are small bugs/flies in the room and toilet. We thought we were staying in our very first hotel which doesn't provide hand towels, only to realise they do provide after day 2's housekeeping. Staff do not understand the concept of Do Not Disturb (DND) sign, and will knock persistently and even tried to open the door when the DND sign is on."
"This is in fact my second stay at M Social Hotel (first time, I booked the Alcove room and  for the second time, I booked the Loft Gallery Room). I was here for a 3D2N stay to celebrate my partner's birthday and I must say, it has been a wonderful staycation! Great rooms, great pool and a nice restaurant!  The lofts are exceptional - room was clean, well-maintained and amenities stocked-up. Two thumbs up to their housekeeping department!  We had breakfast & dinner at their restaurant -  food was good throughout and the service we receive from the restaurant staff, lovely!  I can go on and on. To summarise it, from the moment we entered the hotel till the moment we left, we could not fault a single thing, be it the service, its surroundings or the rooms. So much LOVE for this"
"Had a great staycation at M Social on 1 Nov.  Check-in was quite smooth and quick. The bed felt rather small for a Queen size bed but otherwise everything in the room was perfect.  The highlight of our stay should be the Mixology workshop with Vlad. He was extremely entertaining and knowledgeable, advising us on good combinations to improve our drinks. It was the first time i managed to design my own cocktail and it was fun."
"2nd time coming back to this place. Planned a birthday surprise and celebration at this place and we had an amazing weekend. Special thanks to Davidson, Hazel and Grace for the wonderful assistance that made this celebration smooth and memorable. Thank you."
Room having cleanliness  issue / fingerprint on all shining surface / Small bugs / gnats crawling in the toilet .  Suggest the management focus on the cleanliness issue after COVID lock down and was used a SHN hotel .
"Thank you for the great service, Kumar! You have made our dining experience a fantastic one! Will come back again! Great good and drinks! We enjoyed the oysters promotion and will definitely be back again!"
"slightly small room, but the exceptional service level of staff made up for it! Our front desk staff Davidson made check-in very quick despite the long queue. he was also really friendly and hospitable with our enquiries. will definitely come back again!"
"It was an overall relaxing staycay with my girlfriends. The loft rooms we stayed in are great - pretty well maintained, lovely and clean, fluffy bed although it can be bigger (my girlfriends and I don't feel like it's a queen size bed, more like a super single?). We love the sofa too! Perfect for couch potatoes like us! We checked in on a very warm day and the AC cooled us down really quickly so thumbs up for the powerful AC!  Truth be told, I didn't really have anything to complain until the 2nd day which was our check out day. It started off with the breakfast service. While the food was delish, the service quality should be improved. We arrived at a timing which was not as busy because the restaurant was less than half occupied then and we saw a good number of staff on duty."
Booked a package through klook that included a cocktail workshop at Beast and Butterflies. Walked in to a friendly service by Davidson and checking in was really a breeze. Cocktail workshop by Vlad was really fun and we really enjoyed it.
"To be honest, I had my doubts when choosing M Social for a staycation. However, upon arrival, I realised that the photos of the room on websites did not do it justice! It looked so much better in reality compared to the photos taken by previous guests and other reviews.  Check-in: The queue WILL be long due to its popularity and extra measures implemented for COVID-19. Hence, I'd suggest coming 1-2 hours after the check-in timing if you would prefer not to queue 45 mins to check in.  Washroom: It felt very modern. The glass wall between the room and washroom made it look very chic. I also liked how the blinds for the glass wall are built into the wall so it doesn't get wet. Unfortunately, there wasn't a bidet for the toilet.  Shower: Rain shower head and handheld shower head, no"
"Booked M social for my friend’s surprise birthday, she really enjoyed the room where it was clean and comfy. The swimming pool had a great view. Loft premier room was surprisingly bigger than we expected.   Special thanks to the receptionist Shafiq, who checked us in made our stay memorable for us. Definitely coming back soon"
Checked-in on the evening of 25/10 for a night of rest. Everything was settled fast and efficiently thanks to the help of Davidson. He was very friendly and enthusiastic. Great customer service.   Great place to stay for an impromptu getaway.  The only bad point I can bring up is that the air conditioning need some checking. The temperature keeps fluctuating.   But all in all would come back again in the near future.
"This was my first time at M Social, and we took up the Bottled Up Happiness package to celebrate my partner's birthday. The front desk supervisor, Davidson, was really thoughtful in helping us arrange a birthday treat voucher as well as to assist us in getting a later check-out. We truly enjoyed our stay with M Social. Will be sure to come back again."
"Loft Premier Room - kinda small but cosy TV was too near when seated at the sofa seat. Toilet for bathing kinda squeezy.  Checked In on Friday (Thankfully)! Our staycation was 3D2N. Breakfast - it was super understaff and waited for 45mins for our food to be served.  What horrified us was the lack of and poor management - We went out during Saturday's check-in time, there was a long queue. Long story short, we heard that the longest waiting time to check in was 4 hours.  During the late night, we needed some room service to deliver some items - called for almost an hour, but to no avail. Hence we went down and realised that there was only 1 person at the floor.  Overall stay aside from the breakfast, all good as we also had a complimentary cocktail making lesson and the room was"
"We had a night stay at M Social at was delighted by the level of service we receive. The service at the reception by Ms. Geraldine is both personal and professional.  It being the COVID situation, no buffet breakfast allowed but yet we are allowed to choose a great selection of breakfast choices and taste great too!   Our stay was great and with the great staycation offer, we really had a fantastic family time.  We will be back soon!"
"Dear M social staff in charge,   I would like to thanks this two staff ms gretchen and Ms novelia who made my day most enjoyable.   On 23 oct I stayed two nite with m social it was amazing, I have put up an request with gretchen as I told her I would like to check in early as I need to set up my proposal. She willing to help me on my request.   On Friday I finally check in and meet gretchen and novelia both are very friendly and well train and made me feel welcome.   Nothings much I can do but send and feedback. Hope my feedback find u well. Hope u see u all again.   Just one last things beside the rooms abit small and pillow not Comfortable other then that is fine.   Best regards Alex tay"
"Firstly, our room was not ready till 4pm, I don’t expect an early check in,but room not ready at 4pm on a Friday afternoon? Come on.. Secondly, this stay was to celebrate my fiancé’s birthday on the day itself, priory to our arrival, staff committed there will be cake or some voucher. Guess what, there’s nothing. Not to mention there isn’t any greeting despite they did registration for him too. Last but not least, when I was asking for a bucket of ice, the answer I got was I have to go down to the restaurant to pick it up.  Aside from the service level, the size of the room. Be prepared..  I guess during this challenging period, hotel is short of staff but, management, please take care of your staff’s moral.   Only if you take good care of them, your staff then can take care of"
"Decided to support our local hotels and found a good deal on Agoda for an alcove cosy room. The room was not big but was as described, cosy and stylish. The staff were friendly and not as described in some other reviews and they seem they were trying their best to manage the situation. There was a queue of about 10 people when we arrived but after completing the declaration form and safe entry, we proceeded in to collect our keys and were off to our room. If there was anything to gripe about, The pool was rather small. All in all, a good staycation!"
"Through my short stay with M Social Singapore, I believe they really have a huge room for improvements.   Firstly, I was given keycard access upon check-in when my assigned room was not ready. As I had to start my work online, I dialled to the reception multiple times with no response. In the end, I had to resolve issues such as blinds not shutting properly and the lack of toiletries at the front desk.   Secondly, it could have been due to the room hasn’t been fully ready but, there were dust in various corners of the rooms.   Thirdly, when I did my booking, I left a remark that it was my birthday and, being under the Millennium group, entitled me to a birthday treat (voucher for dessert for M Social), which was missed out during my check-in.   However, on the bright side, the"
"It was an amazing experience staying in M social. We took the 3D2N Alcove Cosy room with Perfume making + Cocktails making package. Check in was smooth, took less than 20min and the room is quite spacious for 2. There is also gym and swimming pool facilities if you need some outdoor activities.  On our first night, we had cocktail making session by Vladyslav. Vlad was very friendly and knowledgeable. He taught us the steps on how to create a cocktail and types of alcohol by smelling. We get to choose our base and a few other juices to match it. Shaking a cocktail also have technique! The whole workshop was about 95min. But YAYYYYY we created our own free customised cocktail and get to drink it! Cheers ~  Breakfast menu was quite simple. Due to Covid, it’s ala carte menu not"
"Stayed in the alcove terrace room. Regrets... Shocked to the see that the wash basin is outside of the toilet and in the room itself?  Imagine doing your business in the toilet and yet you have to come out of it into the room to wash your hands?   The room is small so prepare yourself to have your toes get hurt hitting the sharp legs of the bed every now and then!   The outdoor chair could have a proper wicker sofa instead of the cloth because when it's raining, there's no way you can sit on it until it totally dries up.   There were also only one robe in the room, and when I asked for another one for my partner at around 11pm, the front desk mentioned that the housekeeping department was already closed and I have to head down to the front desk to collect myself. No toothpaste"
"We have booked the impromptu 1 night stay as our house was under painting works.   Arrived around 4pm on 19th Oct to check-in, and thankfully no long queue (which was greaaaat!). Received the room keys after registration , and within minutes we were in our Alcove Cosy Room.   It was the right decision booking M Social, as we had such a good night’s rest. The night curtains worked wonders in blocking out any morning light and the bed/pillows was just very comfortable for us. Air condition was just right too.  We woke up feeling really very fresh , we did not realize it was morning already as the night curtains blocked out any light from the room.  Luckily, we made it on time for breakfast at Beast&Butterflies as we woke up only at 9:45am, and breakfast ends at 10am. Breakfast was"
"Yes! we dont wanna come back to our home! 😂😂 Because we had a GREAAATTT TIME here in M SOCIAL! People are Very polite and kind! We had lunch and breakfast in their reataurant and foods are awesome! Please try the pork nuckle! Staff in the reataurant have great service and very POLITE! it is sad we didnt get their names! Thank you guys for the experience! credit to the chef as well! Receptionist are great as well polite and kind! sad again we didnt got their names, the Filipina outside that day of our check in..21/10/2020 around 11am. We stayed at room 355 and my daughter keep on saying..""I LIKE THIS ROOM"" credit to the house keeping team who keep it clean and tidy with full amenities..and we met them at the corridor and they greeted us ""Good day"" with a smile thank you guys!"
"Me and my husband has an overnight staycation with a cocktail workshop inclusion.  Reached the hotel at 3:20 pm, check in was a breeze and very smooth. We were assisted by Ms. Geraldine at the reception. She was very kind and nice. She even helped us booked our cocktail workshop.  Room was normal size for a singapore standard. Clean and cozy. Wish there is a bidet 😊.  Cocktail workshop- we had a 4 pm time slot. The mixologist, Vlad, was very entertaining. We really enjoyed our time there. He is very patient. Thank you for the take away shaker. This was actually the highlight of our stay. Dinner- we ordered a dinner from Beauty and Beast restaurant. Food was definitely good.  Breakfast- we would like to commend the very accommodating staffs at the Beauty and Beast Restaurant. We"
We went for the staycation due to Covid period. Very pretty place. We spend around $230 for a loft terrace room. Check in queue was long but very fast. The staff made sure that we are all safe to enter. The hotel was near to great world city. We just have to walk around 15 min to reach there. The inside of the room was really nice but pretty small. My room came with a tree resting place which was located outside. The bed is located on top of the loft. So no disturbance from tv. Just sleep. We had dinner at Beast & Butterflies. Which is the best for the day. But it is a bit pricy. We took a stroll after our dinner and end up in Great World City to get the awfully chocolate. The stroll was filled with people. And a lot of dog lovers. We enjoy the after meal breeze walking. Overall
"Love the overall outlook of this hotel! Staff upon check in was lovely, we were also served by the kind manager, Ms Geraldine, during our stay, and she was really helpful, we asked for assistance in directions and also regards to the facilities for the hotel and she was always so eager to help. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family. Will return again soon!"
I stay more than a week to this hotel lovely stay and food supply daily 3 times and bed comfortable too hotel quite big and spacious thank you for beautiful hotel government give we hope we can come back again to stay
"Just ended our staycation at Msocial today. It was a home away from home for the two of us! We stayed on Sunday-Monday to celebrate my birthday. When checking in, there was a long queue and I realised that it was the same when I checked out too and the other guests were checking in. Maybe what the hotel could do is to open up more counters / install self check in kiosks to facilitate the overwhelming queue in the future and that the workload of the front desk personnel could be minimalised. :)   Our initial booking was for the loft room but due to technical difficulties on the air conditioner my partner was given the information an hour prior to check in. However, I have to say that the manager Gretchen handled the situation with upmost professionalism! We didn’t get to stay our"
"I visited M Social and was thoroughly disappointed in a number of items: - After checking in, we found that our room was extremely stuffy, very dusty and we could even see food from the previous traveler left behind. So we asked for it to be thoroughly cleaned again. This is VERY shocking and disappointing as I was under the impression that being SG clean, M social would put more effort into disinfecting and sanitizing the room.  - there was no chair in the room despite it being a business hotel and when we asked for one, we were told it was designed to be this way. That’s really inconvenient as we had to work from our beds or floors...   - our door lock spoilt and locked us IN the room, and the next day it locked us OUT because of the battery issue. M social came to fix it"
"Would like to commend the manager in charge, Geraldine, for her good customer service and hospitality. She attended to us very well.  Room is pretty cosy and decent. Location is fairly convenient.   Unfortunately, the only problem we faced was that the hotel per se does not have any complimentary parking spaces for us guests when we arrived. Yet when I booked on their millennium website directly, it did state that there was a free parking space. However, Manager explained apologetically to us that it was because we did not book online through M Social instead but millennium(which would have stated it does not have foc parking). Extremely misleading on their part."
Staff was nice friendly and helpful and allow me us to late check out I would like to thank Davidson for his nice and professionally service towards me and my friends will definitely come back and stay with m social
Accommodation is well stay and comfortable Excellent service credit to Davidson and angel for their prompt response and actions. Hotels nearby have a fews good restaurants to try. its the best Hotels i stay so far this year.
There is a lot of work that needs to be done.   Bad air con. Air con tec had to do air con servicing while we were in the room. Even after that is didn’t work.  No mini fridge to chill your drinks.  Long curtains are pretty however when I moved it I could feel dust fall onto my face and eyes.   Complimentary ice is till 10pm and must be self collected at the restaurant beside the hotel. Basically it’s not convenient.   Hotel level corridor stinks of food gone bad and staff do not do their rounds to freshen up the area.   Housekeeping literally opened my room door. When we had just checked in. There was no proper info was passed front office to housekeeping.   Clearly mentioned we were celebrating a birthday prior booking. Hotel staff mentioned there will be a dessert voucher
"It was a staycation on 5 Sep in the Premier Loft Room and I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone. Check-in process is long, room was not clean despite being SGClean certified, customer service is poor.  There are much better hotels to have a staycation at, and I will not recommend M Social at all."
"Decided to stay at the M social for our honeymoon after we got married last weekend. To celebrate the occasion, we paid for an upgrade to the Terrace Loft (212), however the room we got wasn’t complete. There was only 1 bathroom towel, no face towel provided and the in-room phone was disconnected and no phone was replaced.  We called the reservations team from our own mobile phone to inform and only the towels were delivered to us. Till we checked out, no technician came to the room to replace the phone even though the FO ensured that they’ve keyed into the system.   The towels at the pool were stained and looked like it wasn’t cleaned well.   On our second night, we went out and switched on the make up room light. We came back to only have the beds cleaned and towels"
"From the past reviews, there were issues with the newly implemented processes post covid, but it's good to see the improvements.   1. Though queue to enter is long on a Sat, there's 5 staff facilitating the check-in process (1 at entrance, 4 at check in counter). It's quite fast. Professional team at work. 2. As it's a stay to celebrate my partner's birthday, I have personally emailed the reservation team to see what services I can get from hotel. Darshan and Mandy has promptly responded to my query and informed us services they have like deco at xx$, also offered complimentary dessert voucher. While that being said, the actual day caught me off guard as I didn't take on the deco package but found it done within the room. Instead of dessert voucher,we were offered two welcome"
