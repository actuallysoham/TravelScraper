"Husband and I booked the 1 BR Premium Suite using our SRV Voucher for our 5th anniversary staycation. We stayed 3D2N. Check in time is 3pm but I reached the hotel at 11am and planned to leave my bags there with the concierge first as  we had some brunch plans and planned to come back at 3pm. However the Receptionist, (Vanessa I think? Guest Service Supervisor.) allowed me a complimentary early check in, which was kind of her!  When we first stepped into the room, we were impressed by the cleanliness of the room! Except for a bit of tape that was left on a really high part of the wall (I guess the previous guest pasted some decorations for a party or celebration?) which would have been hard to notice anyway, everything else was thoroughly clean and you could tell the room"
"Stayed here 3 times, once in studio and twice in 1br suite. Overall good experience.  There is privacy. You don't get many people crowding around lift area or loud talkers as the room are sound proofed. The furnishing are modern, practical and comfortably homely. Lightings are good. Love the spacious bathroom and deep soak stand alone tub. Amenities are good too. Gym and pool are clean.  Room cleanliness are acceptable."
"Since we cant travel, this place is the best place to bring your partner/family/friends to staycay,10 mins walk to ascott orchard from somerset. Fast check in , clean, best part is they even have microwave!   Overall 10/10!!"
Long check-in queue. Have already waited 30 mins and 20 people in front of us. Friendly staff but still not good enough. Management should have staffed adequately for a busy day at the very least. This is a two star experience. Sorry!
"During my stay, the cleaning service lost / stole a medical device I’m using. Despite hours of discussing this issue with the staff, they only agreed to partially cover the cost of a replacement, leaving me with a significant chunk to pay out of pocket (not to speak of the hassle of getting it replaced)."
Super fast check-in and check-out. Was told that I was being upgraded but the room is exactly the one I was paying for. The staff were friendly. Called Jarren 2.03pm on 3 Dec 2020 to inform that I would be celebrating anniversary for that stay and I was simply asked what is my budget. I thought something nice like a small cake would be arranged during my stay but guess not. Stayed at Pan Pacific Suite before and they surprised us with a small cake. Nothing much but the thought counts.
"The location of the hotel was great. Getting groceries to whip up a meal at the room's kitchenette was assessable  but items are slightly pricier. The 1 bedroom layout was spacious and the bathroom was lovely, I like how the stand-up shower is beside the tub, enclosed with a glass wall & door. Kitchenette was basic and functional, made a lovely dinner during our stay. Could have asked for more kitchen towels to ease up with the cleaning and drying of dishes.  My only downside for me was the bed, it was squeaky and the pillows were on the medium to firm side, so the sleep was that great. Overall, room was lovely and will come back again."
"Had a reservation for a 3D2N stay from 25th-27th Dec. Coincide too was my birthday which fell on 26th. Checking in/out was a breeze, the apartment was lovely, decor was tasteful, the amenities provided in it was adequate although the bedroom could've come with a safe, the pool was awesome, the gym was good too. I just wished there was Netflix and Youtube on the tv. Ordered food too from Kith downstairs and it was absolutely amazing. Ascott exceeded my expectations of a serviced apartment and my stay was incredible, except it was marred with the presence of my 'work of character' partner. I hope to be back again in Ascott for 2021."
"Checked in on 24th for our 3D2N stay. This is my 2nd stay at Ascott Orchard, and booked 1 bedroom deluxe apartment. Decided to come back as my daughter loves the place. Checked in was smotth though with a slight waiting time, understandable as it was Xmas Eve. The apartment comes with big bedroom, big bathtub, fridge, dishwasher, washing machine cum dryer, oven and kitchenette and utensils. They are also kind to provide little snacks as well as masks and santiser pack. Link bridge to paragon Which makes it convenient to get out stuff as well as short walk along orchard at night. All These make it perfect for the stay.  Friendly staff and always greet guests. Pleasant greetings and smiles always make my day. Both my daughter and i had a very enjoyable stay, that she requests to"
I really wish to come back again. Enjoy the swimming as no crowd. Speedy check in and check out. Nice bedroom with pantry. Forks spoon knife plates are all available. No worry for cake cutting. Nice and new room also...
"Service staff were professional, polite and helpful. We liked the pools. Apartment amenities are adequate. Will be better if they provided laundry detergent (Pan Pacific does). Nice bathtub. Breakfast from Kith was very good in both quantity and quality. We would have given Ascott the full 5 points if they had offered us early check in and or late check out. I requested for one because it was my daughter’s birthday and my wedding anniversary. They only offered us early check in at 2.30pm and late check out at 1pm. Quite disappointing :("
Service was good. Room size and cleanliness were excellent.  Good facilities as well. Swimming pool and gym are  maintained.  Location is well located in the city with easily available public transportations.
"i would say thier service is damn good la. room damn big sia. i book studio but was given 1 bedroom. bed was cozy water pressure just nice. & room is so clean as well. pool damn big also. but 1 thing that upset me was. i asked for baby cot & baby bathtub. so the uncle who spend up those item press for the doorbell which it took me quite sometime to respond to the door cause i was pacifying my baby. & when i was abt to get to the door, the uncle just open my door using the master keycard. wa lao. what if i was breastfeeding my baby or being naked or what? & that uncle mask wasnt even worn properly, which didnt cover his nose at all. i hope the management can really look into that matter on them opening a guest room w/o permission. really is nt a good thing on that."
"Service is great at reception. Pre-arrangement of checkin timing helps ease the crowd during checkin period. Booked a one-bedroom serviced apartment. Really spacious and equipped with all the kitchenette necessities with oven, electric stove top, a huge fridge and nespresso machine. Appreciate the welcome gift for Ascott members placed in the living room, uncommon drinks and snacks.   Bedroom is nice with a comfy king size bed. Complete with a full length wardrobe and TV, with option to connect to hdmi as well. Slippers and bathroom amenities provided.   Bathroom is lovely, with a bathtub within the really spacious shower area, with rain shower. There is a nice view just not  sure if the windows have a one-way privacy film so we drew down the shades.   Breakfast is to be ordered"
The room is clean and spacious. The hotel lobby is conveniently connected to Paragon thru the carpark. The staff are friendly and helpful. We are able to enjoy their gym and pool facilities with lesser crowd. Will visit if there is another great deal.
"Good place to staycay with family, very accessible to orchard and city area. My family enjoyed their stay here. Service was top-notch, best to go when there's promotion. However, food is not halal at present."
"front desk officers were helpful and efficient. cleanliness of the room is superb. amenities nearby, very easily accessible. would definitely book again! kith is avg, not necessary to try out but it is convenient."
It was great staying there! 3D2N is totally not enough :( wish we could stay longer instead of 3D2N cause the cleaniness and comfort in the hotel is so good! Will definitely come back to stay again and the staffs at the front office were all very friendly and kind! ☺️
"I stayed in a studio executive room, which had everything that I needed as I had to remain in my room for the first 3 days of my stay and when I wasnt working. Lovely clean, spacious, comfortable apartment with everything I could need. Room service was very prompt and all of the staff I met and spoke to were all very friendly and welcoming. The location of the hotel is perfect. I will definitely be looking at staying here again as and when I return to Singapore."
"Great apartment, good location, friendly and helpful staff, shopping area is just a walk away, overall the best ever staycay stays we had in Singapore, definitely a recommended apartment for all travellers."
Everything was perfect. Love the ambience and cleanliness of the room and hotel. Staff were attentive and accommodating. Cant get other good hotel with 2Br as lovely as this. Just a 5 mins walk from main orchard road for shopping.
"Firstly, the service was excellent. All the staff were very polite and friendly. The room was also beautiful. Very spacious and kept well. Quite new and really beautiful. The only setback was, the carpet was not too clean and it would be good if there was some rags/kitchen towels placed near the basins. There was no cloth to wipe the kitchen top after washing out plates etc. And a broom could do as well, incase we need to sweep up something at that moment. Room service is there but some things we can take care of it ourselves. The dining table wasn't too clean. These are just some minor things. I'm normally very fussy but this place is really nice..... I don't regret taking this place at all for my mum's birthday. I would definitely book again and I strongly recommend it. Oh"
"I felt sad that my 2nd trip to Ascott Orchard is a disappointment. I required for early check in & also high floor room when I booked the room. There is a reply email stating that my request is taken notice but it depends on availability. It is not last min booking. But the floor I am assigned is level 4 on the gym & swimming pool facilities level, right outside the gym (first room) The serviced apartment is 20-floors. Worse the room is dusty & the door is not sound proof. I can hear children giggling & running outside my door. Along the corridor there is a staff sitting outside the elevator which is a turn off experience for a ""luxury stay""... My second room is worse so near to the staff who is sitting near the elevator.  The dust in the room is not acceptable too. The fabric"
Ascott Singapore has always provided a comfortable and relaxing stay throughout. Situated just a stone throw from the busy Orchard Road it is a perfect getaway if u want a bit of Orchard shopping and the quiet peace and stay in the area.  The room was well maintained and clean and amenities are as great as new as you wished for.   We had a great stay in terms of recharging ourselves and also indulging in the shopping street of Singapore icon.  One of the best lodging in the orchard road area.   Thank you Ascott!  Cheers  Mr Lai
"I choose Ascott Orchard because of its clean fresh look interior. It is located at Orchard so it’s very accessible to public transportation, malls and foodcourt. The staff are warm and friendly, from receptionist to cleaners."
"My son and myself have been staying here for a month due to Pandemic. We really enjoy everyday here, convenient, modern, friendly and most of all it balances very weel between the warmth of home and the convenience of a hotel.   The staffs all are very friendly and proactive. I'd like to especially thank Delphin Chiu, who's been there every time we need help. She's very helpful and represents the true spirit of service mindset. She provides a lot of peace of mind for guests in times of uncertainty.   Ascott brand is a manifestation of care. Well done!"
"I decided to spend my birthday by having a staycation here, my partner recommended this as it looks really nice on Agoda. We had a fast and efficient check in, with coffee/tea and cold water amenities available. We also felt safe as there were temperature checks before you step in. The most important part of the stay will be the room as you spend the most part of it in the hotel. Spacious bathroom, nice bathroom amenities, lots of storage space and impressive choice of tv channels including sports and movies. The most impressive of all is the reply I received after submitting an online review of my stay. Not only did Ms Cynthia acknowledged my review, she did 3 things most hotels seldom does. 1) It was not a generic reply, I can tell she took time and effort to reply and address"
"Awesome and comfy stay ever, great location (shopping mall nearby), friendly staff and the bed so comfortable which you just want to laze around did nothing.. definitely will come back again! Looking forward to the day :)"
Rooms are clean and functional more geared around service apartment concept  Only one coffee shop at the ground floor no in room service. Opens at 6:30 am closes at 9:30pm so of you are late arriving no food available in hotel  Easy access to Orchard road shopping and transport
"Checked out the Ascott as I always stay at the hyatt which is closeby. Went to look at the 2-bedroom apartment which is beautiful but overly priced at over $1000SIN p/night. Location is decent, walking distance to Orchard road."
"It is not like vey luxury hotel, but nice furnished apartment, no attraction nearby, but it is about 5 minute walk to orchard street I was at the two bedroom apartment, with small kitchen , it is great for a family of 4 , the location, it has a very nice swimming pool in the 4th floor  What I don't like is that they are very strike in check out time, they did not allow me to stay till 1 pm , but it took me 45 minute to chick out !!"
"Perfect location, extra room, good price, and good staff... im so lucky because i get free upgrade to 2 bed rooms suites... you can easy to find halal food near the aprtments... you can also cook and also wash your clothes..."
"Spent 3 nigths here with my family. Booked the 2 bedroom apartment with 2 baths, kitchen, and living room. Located in Orchard, link bridge to Paragon. The hotel is clean. Always stay here when I go to Singapore."
"The Ascott Apartment Hotel is very centrally located on Orchard Road and is surrounded by high quality shopping Centers for virtually any shopping need. There is a vast range of eateries ranging from  high quality, low cost food courts to high quality, high cost restaurants offering all types of Asian and European food. The hotel itself offers  single and double room apartments as well as hotel rooms. During this visit in January we booked a single bedroom unit but were upgraded to a double bedroom one with two bathrooms. The apartments are full self contained with layouts that are very functional ( can be seen on the hotel website) with a fully equipped kitchen coming with separate dishwashing and clothes washing/drying machines and all normal cooking equipment, crockery and"
"Ascott gave us good memories. Very nice room, best service, very clean. Room provide all you need from microwave to washing machine. Very recommended to family with kids also. Will come back soon. You will love it too"
"This is our second stay at this hotel. As we expected, the room is big and clean. The location is also very close to Orchard and connected to Paragon Center. Will be back here for the next trip. It has kitchen which is very helpful for me who hungry all the time."
"Excellent location, direct connection to the nearby Shopping Mall,  and the staff were all very friendly and  helpful.  No complaints , the room and facilities were excellent and would recommend this place to anyone if asked for opinion."
You could walk to Paragon from this hotel thru a short cut wherein the exit is near the reception and connecting to a bridge. This was especially helpful as it was raining everyday when I was in spore. The room is clean and spacious. The shower is amazing. Overall a very good stay.
"We stayed for 3 months. All facilities worked as they should. Comfortable bed. Nice pool and gym. Fantastic staff can't do enough to assist. Kitchen area in our appt was more than adequate and we had some nice meals when in for the night. It's not cheap, but it's good value."
"This would be my second time checking in at Ascott Orchard Singapore. For this trip we stayed at the 2 bedroom premier suite as I was travelling with kids, and therefore this place is perfect for us - needed the home ambiance, with the necessary washer and dryer provided in the unit (I was told that amenities would differ based on the type of unit/room). And with the light cooking (proper refrigerator, cooker hobs and utensils are provided for in this unit) for those moments when they simply needed nourishment after swimming or those excursions around Singapore.  What we liked: 1) The ease of check in and out - do take note that full payment was made prior to our arrival, and they do adhere to the check in time at 3pm. Our unit was not ready and we arrived early (around 2pm),"
Stayed for a mere 36 hours but delighted nevertheless. Perfect location without the busy noisy bustle. Enjoyed the excellent room with the thoughtful and stylish design. Will return if we have the chance.
"Reception staff did not understand when I requested for hotel card key to self check in at the kiosk. No hotel card key for me to self activate. While the check in queue was too long, thinking self check in would save me the hassle.   Given that 1 of the guest (auntie) who hold up the queue for so long. Not sure what she was doing because she was holding a Singaporean passport showing toward the reception staff. I had to interrupt her conversation with reception staff asking for the hotel card key for me to self check in. Since there were no other staffs available.   That guest (auntie) whom felt no guilt said that I was holding up her time. And the reception staff did nothing but looking blankly at both of us and continue serving the guest (auntie).  If there is a self kiosk,"
"there is connecting from Ascott to a mall in front of the building and it's very helpful when rainy day. The location it self is near to orchard road it's only 3 minutes walking distance we can find malls, shopping center, coffee shops."
"Poor check-in process, arrived at 2:5pm on a Saturday and waited a couple of minutes to be greeted by a friendly front desk staff. Full payment upon check-in and only then informed you that your room was not ready and check-in time was 3pm (which I was well alerted).  When asked to ring when room would be ready, the response was ""sorry, we can't ring overseas number"" Oh, so you call yourself a serviced apartment for locals or visitors?  (not surprised when noticed many who checked-in after me were using all Pink IC (local Singapore ID card). She can't check with housekeeping how long they would take as not to ""pressure"" them.   Their solution was to buzz me up to 4th floor where the lounge was while I have to leave my luggage at level 1 when my friend was with me waiting.  Soon"
"As it like 2nd home, it’s nice to meet hotel staff who are warmth, accommodating and served with great enthusiasm. They are Prakhas, Suraini and Nicholas also Joanne and Anna Lee from Kith Café. The property has a comprehensive facilities of a gym, swimming pool and residents’ lounge. It’s modern and chic with a clean and tidy layout room. It  is in central and famous Orchard Road area  which is easily accessible to shopping malls, public transport and train stations. Also various and many F & B outlets and museums. One is spoilt for choice for things to do; whether to laze along the pool and outdoor activities. I am sure I will be back again."
Location of the hotel is awesome! Hotel is clean and well furnished. We had a problem with the air conditioning on our first night but it was quickly resolved by the hotel. Bed and pillows were uncomfortable. The huge square pillows were unnecessary and uncomfortable. The bed was too soft. Checkout was fast and easy.
The hotel is worth the price. The staff are friendly and very helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. The location was also convenient since it is in Orchard where the shopping malls are there and an MTR station.
We stayed a total of 7 nights and highly recommend not to stay here when travelling with kids while construction for a high rise is expected to last for another few years - if completed. It is stated on their website re noises however it is beyond bearable especially when no one offers any kind of solution from the hotel.
"I stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment in this property for 7 nights between 25th November - 2 December 2018.  We were there for my mother’s medical checkup and the access to the hospital and the Paragon shopping mall was convenient.  The hotel decor and facilities were new and acceptable given the price charged, which is high (even by Singapore standards).  I just hope that the rooms near the very loud next door construction site are offered at a discount as some of the residents staying in those rooms were complaining of noise that could be heard.   Given the high price,  I feel the management can make a little extra effort with the overall customer care, response and attention to little details to make the stay that much more special.  One observation - given that they have long"
"We stayed in a lovely tw bedroom apartment  which offered all comforts: cleaned dayly, small kitchen fully equipped with cutlery, plates, cups, pots, coffee machine with complimentary coffee refill, tea and milk and dish washer . It had a washing machine and clothes rack, ironing facilities which werr all really useful especially when traveling with children. The apartment was beautifully furnished and the staff (each and every one) very polite and friendly. The property is connected to the Paragon  center so any kind of shopping is easily accessible. There were also a nice pool and fitness center which I had no time to enjoy, unfortunately. Maybe the place is a bit pricey, but in my opinion it's worth it. Great stay!"
"I stayed in a family suite of 3 Bedrooms. The hotel has great amenities and the reception area is Lv bags stacked as their decor which blew my mind that time. The  location was excellent, one block away from main Orchard Road."
"This is a 6 times i stay in Ascott Orchard Singapore. Overall is Very Good Experience. I stay in Suite Deluxe Room for 4 nights. The room is so big and so comfort. Nice and complete facility in room (kitchen set, washing machine, etc), helpful staff.  Very satisfied."
"Well located not far from Orchard Rd, the accommodation was lovely. But for the price, so it should be. We weren’t able to access our room until after 4pm (we checked in at 3pm) but this was more than covered by being able to get a late check out 4 days later, which was great.  Good facilities (pool, gym) & an easy walk to Somerset MRT.   There is a construction next door, which Ascott note on their website. It’s noisy at times.   Unfortunately, our teen’s phone had the screen damaged while it was on charge & we were out. We reported this to reception who investigated. They say the phone was moved but not dropped when the room was serviced. It’s a he-said, she-said scenario but ultimately my child has a cracked screen not of their doing and Ascott saying they would not do"
"We booked a 1-bedroom apartment to have a bit more space and a kitchenette, and the place was lovely. Our 18 month old felt right at home and loved having space to run around and play. And the location was great with a connecting walkway to Paragon.  The kitchenette was small but sufficient and had everything you needed – an induction cooktop, oven, dishwasher, fridge and freezer and a couple of each item of cutlery and crockery. There's also a Nespresso machine. It was missing a microwave though. They also provided a high chair on request which was handy. There's housekeeping every day except Sundays and the staff were really friendly.  I felt the place was far cleaner than your standard serviced apartment, but perhaps a bit less so than a 5-star hotel. The hotel slippers they"
"Location is good just 5 minutes walking from Paragon Orchard Road, but Cleaning Service should be better to clean up the room every day. Room rate is pricey, but maybe due to F1 weekend during our stay"
"Booked a one bedroom suite at their hotel, the room was decent but they put me right next to a construction site, where construction noise start right in the early morning till night. As we woke up and opened the curtain their were literally just construction workers staring and sneaking trying to see what’s beyond the window. As this trip I was travelling with my mother who was sick that was undergoing for surgery so obvious we want to be place in a room that is further away from the noises and disturbance. I asked to changed the room on the different side of the hotel that is further from the noise but they don’t seem to care that this is clearly an issue for us. The next morning I called again and they agreed to change for us once we get back from the hospital, and they said"
"The executive studio, which has the lowest rate and located right next to a neighbor, have thinner walls and doors so loud neighbors can be heard clearly, studio premier rooms are mostly the same size but no next door neighbors so you will get more peace and quiet than the former. 1 bedroom studio is way better but at much higher price. Rooms are clean, housekeeping, bell boy and lobby assistants are at best. The only issue we had during our stay, was uncoordinated reception staff which is proven by other reviewers. Most of them are professionals but one of the manager or higher ranked reception staff named Rachel, always made our stay difficult. The first night we stayed, we were assisted by another reception that offered us half price for late checkout on our checkout day (we"
"Stay there around Aug 11. Supposed to be for a week. But after poor service and impression, I decided to shorten my stay to 2 nights and moved on to their competitor in similar area and I was so much happier for the move. Ended up 3 weeks at the competitor.   To put it in some context - I drove my own car. So here are point for point feedback -  1. Parking - Shocked to find that they do not provide complimentary parking. I don't care if the carpark is managed by 3rd parties or not. That is not the guest's problem. The point is all major hotels and service apartments of repute provide complimentary parking. It is just standard to expect so. In addition , the entrance to their alloted carpark was total confusing. The main carpark ramp next to the check in driveway is NOT the"
"We spent four nights at the Ascott Orchard.  It is connected by walkway to the Paragon shopping mall which is full of shops and restaurants and right on the main shopping thoroughfare of Orchard Road. Our suite had a full kitchen and washer/dryer,  There is a good exercise room.  The room was very clean and comfortable.  Fantastic value"
"We are currently staying at the hotel and have had a wonderful experience here. The staff have gone above and beyond, throwing a party for the children with cake and sparklers to celebrate Singaporean National Day. Every whim and ask has been adhered to and then some. Extremely pleased with our stay, and with a 7 month old daughter, that’s no easy feat! :)"
"The staff at this so called upscale residence is terrible.  1. There was a problem with my check in as I booked through an intermediary and it is a direct booking via their website. Upon checking in, the guy told me that they did not collect any pre-payment for the room as the credit card entered when booking on the website did not match the guest name (me) and that i have to settle the amount in full with a credit card matching my name. Have already explained to them that this booking was made via an intermediary and that she have sent an email in to further emphasize that the booking is on behalf of another person (me). Despite many many tries to explain to the gentleman at the front desk, he kept insisting i have to pay for the room in full as due to 'fraud' they did not take"
"It was my second stay in Ascott Orchard, and I love to come here with my family members. I often to visit Singapore and I think a serviced residence like Ascott is worth to try, especially when you travel with family. Location wise is very strategic, near shopping malls & train/bus station. The room was also clean and all the amenities are very helpful during my 4 nights stay."
This is their new serviced apartment located right at the heart of Orchard Road area. The suites are spacious and only minor compliant is rather noisy air-con in the bed room. The pool temperature is surprisingly cool even on sunny days and there is a lounge for residents which is great for meetings. Recommended...
Stayed one night with my family. After check out we came home and realised the hotel charge a penalty fined for long scratched on the floor near living room area in the room that we didn't do that to my credit card. The hotel didt even bother to call and clarify but just charge and send me an email...
We stayed at the Ascott Orchard Hotel in Singapore for 5 days. We could not have had a better location and a more pleasant facility. We had a one bedroom apartment with all of the amenities. The hotel has a fabulous pool that is almost olympic size. To  get to shopping on Orchard Road we could walk the half block on the sidewalk or better yet walk above a cross street by bridge into the Paragon Mall where we did our grocery shopping for breakfast and on one occasion ate dinner. From there it was out the door to Orchard Road and its malls and restaurants. Obviously not everything in Singapore was on Orchard Road but it was not far away by subway or taxi to anyplace else. We definitely want to go back to Singapore and we will stay again at the Ascott Orchard.
"One of the best hotel apartments I stayed in, rooms are clean, spacious and the staff are helpful, great service. Swimming pool was spacious and comfortable. The hotel is connected to Paragon Shopping Mall. And close to two MRT stations."
"Shame that despite booking the Soho Suite and celebrating our special 10 years wedding anniversary, no complimentary perks were given, such as free breakfast for 4 pax for the whole duration of our stay."
"We had a great experience by staying at this property.  We must admit that our check-in process was not that smooth due to the fact that our room was not ready by their official check-in time.  However, our clean lady name Jenli was the best.  She always smile at our family and greet us when she see us going out or coming back.  The front desk check-in people are usually employed by young people with a cold emotionless face.  They do not smile at customer and say anything like welcome to Ascott when guests are checking-in.   However, the place has a great location and great cleaning lady work there too!"
We were told of an upgrade from our booking of 1 bedroom Premier suite. Upgraded to a well furnished apartment. Well kept. Checking in was done in 10 mins. Concierge staff were helpful and housekeeping well done too.
"A short business trip to Singapore well worth it as I stayed in the best location. The hotel is able to accommodate short or long stays as kitchenettes are in the rooms.  The room was clean, no need to bring any amenities as the bath amenities were good quality. The location cannot be beat attached to the Orchard mall with high end shopping, restaurants and even a grocery store in the B level.  There is something for everything.  But most importantly for me is the AC was cold in this super hot and humid country."
"+ direct access to mall + big room + prime location in orchard + great accomodation  - can be cleaner  Overall, good hotel, suitable for family, perfect location in mainroad orchard. Will be back in the future"
"My company provided me a 45 days of temp living. Never expected it would be such a high quality service apartment. The interior is pretty good as well as the furniture. Staff are very friendly. Special thanks to Jin Li, a house keeping staff.  The location is excellent and it only takes several minutes walk to Orchard shopping area. You can buy almost anything you want there, food, luxury goods, appliances, etc."
"Having spent a considerable amount of time at Ascott Orchard, it has been hard to form a definitive opinion on the property.  We stayed here as part of the the accommodation provided through work during our time in Singapore and the property is part of the serviced apartment options for expats relocating temporarily or permanently to Singapore.  As a long term resident, the constant swells of tourists and guests can be quite tiresome.  On the other hand, we developed some nice relationships with a few members of the concierge and reception staff which made our stay more enjoyable.  In general, the facilities and amenities inside the room were of an extremely high standard.  We slept very well on the bed (helps when the sheets are changed every 2 days) and the appliances all"
"If you are like me who avoid crowd, and typically stays only 1-2 nights maximum, this is the perfect place for you.  Super quick check in/out process, nothing like the crowd at Mandarin (which had always stressed me out). Granted I'd arrived at unpopular 10pm and left at 10am, but the whole time I was staying there felt peaceful. Extra bonus for the friendly and attentive staffs.  I picked the standard room, which was not as roomy as Mandarin's, but the kitchen was new and modern. Perfect for those new moms who need to bring their breast pump equipment.   The direct access to the mall gives me everything I need from a quick breakfast, to reliable Crystal Jade restaurant, Paragon Medical Center, and shopping for my baby!  Only one thing you need to consider, there is no room"
"We stayed in 1 bedroom deluxe with our 8yo boy & 1yo babygirl. We really enjoyed our stay in here. The room is big, very comfortable, very clean and has a fully equipped kitchen. Easy access to Orchard Road as it is connected to Paragon with the link bridge. We can walk on the other side also to 313 Somerset . Hotel staffs are nice.. We surely will recommend friends / family to stay here and will stay in here again if we come to singapore"
A lovely hotel in a great position with fantastic staff. the rooms are immaculate with beautiful decor. we will stay there again and really recommend to all. Great pool area with change rooms. Very quiet location also. Also link bribge access to shopping areas if wet.
"the apartment was fully equipped to a very standard and was very clean. It was like home from home, if not better. I would recommend these to anyone wanting a very comfortable stay in the heart of Singapore. The staff throughout were very helpful at all times."
"Well, after hearing some good reviews about this hotel, I went to this place with my boyfriend for a special occasion and we were not disappointed. We were greeted warmly by the concierge who guided us through the receptionist. The value was excellent compared to other prices we had seen and we found the quality, value and atmosphere hard to match during the rest of our stay. Overall we were very impressed by the cleanliness of the room and by the proactive response from the Operator who had our needs completed. Definitely will be back again!"
"Stayed for 6 nights at this serviced hotel apartment for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised. We cooked our own meals half the time with markets so close. This hotel is tucked away from the main drag of Orchard Road, but is ever so convenient 3-5 min walk to MTR and bus stations. Located between Somerset and Orchard MTR stations it gives you tons of options in traveling and seeing Singapore. Food courts and restaurants are literally down the street. If luxury shopping is your thing, designer shops line Orchard Rd on both sides so shop away. Staff are incredibly helpful and friendly. The hotel is connected via sky bridge to Paragon but the sky bridge takes a little work to get to as it's accessible via parking garage or a short walk past the pool area."
"Everything was better than excellence. We were more than fully satisfied. Great front desk and housekeeping and bellboy teams.  After moving from one hotel to another over a few years, I found this property to be the most suitable of all for me and my family."
"The hotel location is great for leisure and for a rest. This hotel is apartment style, so in the room everything is complete like a home. You can directly reach the Mall Paragon Orchard in a few minutes. You can directly go to the Masjid Al Falah for sholat even in Subuh prayer time."
One of the lamps was not working in my bedroom and the hot water was not working well. I also experienced heavy durian and cigarette smells left behind by previous occupant of the room. It is not the fault of the hotel but perhaps the condition of the apartment after it has been vacated by the previous guest could be better monitored.
"This is our second stay in SG. As usually, hotel staff are super friendly. Quick check in and check out.  Hotel located right behind the Orchard Road and hence very convenience walking distance to major shopping malls. As usual, always love the interior and room is super comfy and luxury. Definately will stay here again for our next trip to SG."
"I recently spent a month in Singapore on Business. I stayed at Ascott Orchard and was very impressed with the service and amenities at the hotel. Room and Kitchen, lounge and bathroom all very good. yes the is construction next door but it did not bther me that much. The Gym is adequate and pool to expectations. The location is very good with easy access to malls and shops. My only complaint was in asking housekeeping to observe the Do Not Disturb. I was woken a few times when sleeping during the day, otherwise a good stay"
"The room is very clean, the children have no shoes to go around, and the feet are not dirty. The mall can be directly connected to the hotel, which is also very convenient. There is also a swimming pool and gym."
"Everything is almost perfect.  Only improvement is to speed up the check-in and check-out process, by either adding more people at the registration counter and/or minimize the paper work required for the check-in"
Modern rooms equipped with everything you will ever need during your stay. It has a very nice pool and gym with modern equipment. It's connected to Paragon Mall via Bridge and short waking distance to Orchard Road. All staff was extremely nice and helpful.
"We arrived very late at night but the reception staff was very welcoming, warm and helpful. It was a serviced apartment with a 5 star hotel customer treatment. Even the security and bell boy were extremely polite and helpful ,too.  Room was clean and tidy and had complete amenities. Kitchen were fully equipped with cooking utensils and dining ware.   Our favourite was the skybridge connecting the facility to Paragon Shopping center. It was super convenient because Paragon is also very adjacent to the medical center. It saved us a lot of time and taxi fares.    Our only quirk was the limited room dining service hour. a 24 hr service would be super helpful for late arrival guest like us."
"Excellent Location connecting to Paragon Mall through Skybridge. Nice Modern Interior Design, in-unit facilities, and spacious multiple bedrooms in the apartment unit excellent for travelling with children."
"Stayed here two times and the services were different during the two times. First time was pleasant and the check in was fast. Second time took some time which doesn’t matter, paragon is just a link bridge away from Ascott.  Got an upgrade during the second time staycation. Pleasant surprise! Friends were surprised too! Upgraded room was a 2 bedrooms kind but the door to another room was just too near for comfort. But it’s good for those who wants to book two rooms at the same time. No breakfast for both times, so no comment on that.  Overall experience was good and would recommend anyone who wants to book that place for a staycation. Price was quite worth it as well. Do sign up their membership to get good promotional price.  Pictures for anyone who is interested to know how"
"Inquire directly with Ascott regarding construction noise before booking and was confirm there won’t be any distraction with the type of room that I booked but still ended up with one.  We inquire once again when we checked in during midnight on day one regarding the issue and was confirm by the check in that we won’t be distribute by it and it turns out the whole family was awaken by them during 7:45am in the morning. Room was changed on the third day of our stayed. We came out to have agreed to have our room change at 3pm when we received a call during the noon of the day as we were not able to change the room immediately because our baby is sleeping. Unfortunately, they called at 2:15pm while everyone’s still napping and finally by 3pm sharp I requested a new room card and a"
"Repeat visit and service of their staff is great. Love it that we can make simple meal in the apartment and get to spend time together. Nice cosy place, beds were comfortable, toilets are huge and clean. Will always recommend for friends coming to Singapore for visit."
Check-in was fast and efficient. Daren Gave clear explaination to us about the hotel facilities. Room was big and spacious and we definetly loves the room. Check-out was very fast by Daren. We would like to thank Daren for helping us through out our delightful stay..
"I liked the hotel based on location and someone said they have handy phones. However, there were no more handy phones upon arrival. Also, I don't know why but a lot of hotels in Asia have a see through bathroom door/wall. It feels awkward. In addition, because of the weather, some of the channels were scrambled, but that was out of their control. Other than that, the hotel was fine. Bed was comfortable, there was a kitchenette with a sink, dinnerware, coffee, tea, and daily complimentary water. They also have an optional rain shower head if you're into those. I also like that it was connected to the Paragon shopping center next door so you could get there without getting wet. To get into the hotel from Paragon, exit the elevator on the 3rd floor and you can use the link bridge"
"Nice placeand location, close to the Somerset!  We enjoy this trip very well! The rooms is very big, our children like the swimming pool very much! It’s very quiet in the night! Close to the Paragon, nice place for shopping and eating! people"
