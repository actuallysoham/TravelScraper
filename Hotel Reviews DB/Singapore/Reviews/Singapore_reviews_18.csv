The room was clean and may have been a tad small but it has everything that you will need/want. The dipping pool was a nice place to just relax by the side and staff were all friendly and remembered when I asked for something and would have it ready when we returned.
Smooth check-in at the counter with well trained staff. Nice and clean room with all the necessary stuff. Hotel has a small pool for children and adult to soak-in. There is a common area where you can have meal brought in from outside. Many food outlets along Killiney Road which is just around the corner. Orchard Road is just 5 min walk away. Value for money stay in Singapore.
Went with my husband and it was really zen and good for relaxation. Gives a feel that you are in Kyoto Japan. Very quiet and near the town area. Going again in May with my husband. Complimentary breakfast at the nearby cafe. But wifi and mobile connection is weak.
"Most people have talked about Lloyd’s Inn Singapore since her renovation. Photos and reviews were seen on #instagram and social media. So is Lloyd’s Inn really what you have seen and read? Let me share some of my personal experiences.   Lloyd’s Inn Singapore is not like any other big hotels. It has her charms - a mixture of quaint and modern minimalist contemporary design. It is also known as a boutique hotel, with an oasis in mind in the city’s center.   As you entered the main entrance, you would walk across an elevated bridge, with a bird’s eye view to the surrounding common areas - a small square size garden with swings, a very narrow dipping pool, and some shaded nooks and crannies where one could relax and read - before reaching the hotel lobby.   Lloyd’s Inn has different"
"As this year is not suitable to travel, so I decided to treat myself to a staycation at Lloyd's inn! I love the big sky room as there is a bathtub outdoors, which makes it more nature feel. The room is cozy and clean as well. Makes me feel very comfortable. Don't mind going for another staycation!"
"I stayed in this hotel for a total of 2 nights wanting to break away from the mundane life. I am glad I booked a garden room as it’s bigger and has outdoor space - something like a balcony if you would like. The shower also is under the canopy of trees. If you like exclusivity, greenery and quaintness this inn will serve you well. I feel it’s more for couples and solo travellers, not so good for the family. First and foremost there’s no proper swimming pool, just a wading pool and the lack of dining facilities onsite is a killer. Breakfast vouchers are giving to go to a nearby cafe for a hot drink and a pastry. But my main qualm is there’s no sound proofing system. I was awakened on both nights, first day by people showering, second day by the heavy rain. So, if you are looking"
"Booked this hotel thru klook using the re-discover voucher. Checking in was fast with complimentary breakfast. Booked the business room which was spacious. I do love the concept of the toilet and showering area but since it’s a outdoor concept, be careful when opening door of your hotel room as flies and mosquitoes could get in. There is a well equipped pantry at level 2 so feel free to have your coffee or heat up your food using microwave provided. All in all, it was a good stay and experience."
Such a wonderful place for staycation.Don’t expect this beautiful place located at Orchard Road. Thank you for Min-receptionist on duty on 9th March 2021.She managed to get my room very early even though the timing that I reached there was not the check in time yet until 3pm. Nice ambience to relaxing and reading the book and very cosy place too. Definitely will come back again.  Regards  Dziauddin Mahamud Check in 9th March 2021
"We booked a night stay at Business Room with Breakfast with the intention to rest after our PWS. Went to browse through their Instagram and found that it's quite an ideal spot for photoshoot. I proceed to contact the hotel personnel and they agreed to allow us for photoshoot at their premises. The check in process was a breeze, they even wrote gave us a card with chocolate bar, we truly appreciate the small gesture. Eateries are conveniently located along the stretch of road. breakfast come with pastry and beverage at Artisan Boulangerie Co also just  located down the stretch of road.  One area for feedback would be parking lots, would be better if hotel do provide parking lots instead of the public parking area. Overall, I really love the vibes of the hotel, it allow you to"
"Recently celebrated my birthday here. I booked the standard room and the hotel was nice enough to upgrade me to one of the nicest rooms available here. I would like to thank them for the upgrade as it made my birthday celebration so much more amazing. As for my stay here, this place was fantastic from the staff service right down to the room itself. The staff service was flawless. Everything was beautiful and scenic. Definitely an escape from the usual city life. Look forward to coming back here again. Thank you once again for the amazing birthday gift."
"Not sure if the experience was influenced by COVID policy or what not. The guest reception was not really friendly and receptive to deliver our stuffs outside to our room. Instead, they called our room to let us know. Furthermore, the check-in process was quite slow and not as welcome.  Overall, it was quite a decent stay as the room was cosy enough for two pax. But the picture looks better though. The amenities provided were quite satisfactory too. Pool was really small. Will consider staying again!"
"I had always wanted to experience staying here, and I finally had the chance to. Do note that if you drive, you can only park along the street. The hotel is tucked away in a corner, blink and you might miss it, which I almost did; as I looked around for its entrance. The hotel itself is understated, and you may even mistake it for one of the many private residences in the area. Guests checking in would have to walk through a side entrance to get to the lobby and reception area.   I was glad the hotel allowed me to bring my bicycle into the room. Of course, I checked with them first. The rooms, industrial-looking with cement flooring, are spread over two floors and mine overlooks a garden. I do like the open shower area and the bed on a separate level. You do not have to worry"
"If you want to imagine you're on a short break in Bali, this is the place to go. If you're big on room service, being waited on hand and foot and fancy facilities, do head somewhere else.  I stayed in the Big Sky Room and it was a perfect escape. The size of the room was amazing, lots of space to breathe and pack things away during your day. There was a staircase that lead up to a little desk area which was a lovely touch to separate having to do work. The outdoor bathtub was A DREAM, they even had one of those tables that sits across the tub so you can llace your stuff (book, drink, candle) without getting it wet.  The wading pool was ideal for just chilling, it rarely gets busy during the weekdays and there's plenty of shaded areas if you prefer that. The staff are extremely"
"room was clean and cosy though small. staff were generally polite, but could speak up and greet guests, although expected from a 3 star hotel. able to hear some noises outside the room door. the pool is really small and kind of dirty with murky water and fallen leaves inside, thus we didnt swim. however i really enjoyed the room and the location."
"I would say their service are pretty polite, they also tried to get a “queen” bed for us and some extra chocolates with a appreciation card hand written as we checked in as a couple as requested, but the sheets and cups are stained & dirty (we were disgusted), poor internet; wanted to use their pool, but it was milky as we got turned off after checking their pool out and not use it instead. Not a quiet place for staycay as way too much noise outside. More for instagram worthy place for pictures. Aside from that, a free breakfast is reasonable for the price you paid for the room i guess, pastry and a hot drink from cafe that serves good pastries. It is worth the experience, but maybe not coming back again."
"Received a ‘Free Upgrade’ from a previous stay. Had a relaxing & tranquil time for my first stay previously & this bigger ‘Big Sky Room’ is so much more, like my own secluded heaven cave away from the busy city!  My only complain is the amount of ants crawling around on the tables & chairs at outdoor pantry ‘smoking area’. We had to use our hands to shoo it away. Should hang a handy brush for stayers to brush it away. Do please maintain this area well cos the natural settings & views from here is nice.  At the pool area, I recommend hanging long brushes at the side of the outdoor beds so that we can brush off the fallen leaves from the trees.  Other than that, the rooms are well maintained, very clean. The beds are super comfy!"
"Nice place.  Simple but nice fixtures.  No hassle in checking in & out. Things are working in the room. Was having some difficulty in handling the main door as it was newly amended.  Location is just a bit off from Orchard Road, just 6mins walk to Orchard Central.  Was told direct booking is cheaper than through hotel search portals."
"The room was much smaller than it looked on the photos. I booked the business suite and the actual room was very small. I really liked the outdoor shower though that was really cool. The couch, TV are all really small too. The place was relatively clean but could be better. The outdoor pool is really small as well it’s like the size of a kid’s pool. I do like that it’s so close to somerset and dhouby ghaut. Overall I felt the place was not worth the price I paid for."
"It was a perfect stay! The big garden room is clean, spacious and cozy. This kind of room is suitable and good stay for group of friends (there’s private outdoor area). The room design is unique and we love it so much! 😍The staff over there is very responsible and friendly. Definitely worth for a second visit!💯"
I had a delightful experience. 🥰💛 It was a short stay but still it was relaxing and satisfying one. Thank you for your kind accommodation and suprise birthday treat it was totally unexpected and very much appreciated
"We booked a staycay here for our wedding anniversary.  In general, we like the concept of the place, and how convenient it is. Lots of eateries outside the accommodation and a stone’s throw to Somerset.  However, certain things did irk us quite a bit.  Firstly, for both nights we stayed there, we smelt smoke through the ventilation system. It was super uncomfortable and frustrating to be breathing in smoke while trying to sleep.  Secondly, the doors do not close silently... they slam hard when you leave or enter the room. The place is generally echoey, and I can imagine many people staying there would hang out late in Town.  So we heard lots of doors slamming when we were sleeping."
Excellent Location : walking distance to Orchard Road. Nice café down the street for breakfast.  Quiet & Cozy room with helpful staff. More than sufficient space for 2 at a reasonable price. Some cable channels on television meant you will not missed any EPL matches during your stay.
"Best part of this stayca is its quite relaxing and away from the busy area. However, the rooms were little small and abit dirty. Found scor tape on the top of the bed frame and the floors were quite dirty (perhaps it's nature style hence small leafs and brunches were found).  Best takeaway is the pool area that does not look like you are living in SG.  Probably next round will try the biggest room with stairs and rain showers outdoor."
"I provided my credit card details over the phone for booking as the page was not easy to navigate to make a reservations of your rooms. I am not sure if the person took down my credit card number wrongly or I was not clear over the phone but the last digit of my credit card number was wrong so the $100 deposit apparently could not go through when they tried to deduct it.  Instead of calling me to check, the service staff wrote me an email 4 days before my check-in to tell me that they had cancelled my booking.   I called back and thankfully got it reinstated. I mentioned that a booking should not be cancelled before calling the customer but no effort to understand or empathize.  I had booked for the Big Sky Room and my son loves climbing up staircases. After check-in and seeing"
"Booked the Big Sky Room for one-night.   Service staff were very courteous, and the room had a really nice design and feel. Minimal color tones, but was quite cosy at the same time.   Location was superb; it was in a quiet neighbourhood, but also very near a whole stretch of eateries/restaurants, and a 5-min walk to the shopping district of Orchard Rd.   I do have two areas to point out for improvement.  First, online responses to my queries for early check-in were generic and clearly copy-pasted from the FAQ, that I had already read beforehand. I understand that early-check in is indeed subject to availability and check-out time of previous occupants, but more effort can be put into the writing of the email replies.  Second, some minor imperfections to the cleanliness of the"
"I am overall disappointed with my stay. The room and breakfast was ok. But it was not a nice experience because after we checked in. There was someone  washing the floor outside and we could hear him spraying it against the panel above our bed when we were trying to get a nap. And we thought it will be better at night but it did not. We kept hearing door slamming sound. This morning, same thing happened and can hear the housekeeping as well. Not worth it."
"Location is nicely tucked within the accomodation area of oxley road. Slight walking distance of around 10 minutes to Orchard shopping district.  Intial impression of the place being exquisite and classy. It indeed matches the impression. Basic room feels homely and comes with an outdoor sheltered shower. The pity is that the television feels small, (32 inch?) And kinda unresponsive at times.  For the pool wise, it's not exactly your Olympic size swimming pool but more towards a dipping pool. Certainly great to feed more pictures to your IG. Ps: do keep your key card along for discounts over at the ABC cafe for your breakfast fix."
"Definitely a great place for couples and families to enjoy a quick silent retreat in this urban resort. Very serene environment and staffs are welcoming. Came for a birthday and there was amenities upon arrival so thank you to the team !! Asked for amenities and was delivered fast. Check in and out was smooth. Pool was too small for swimming but overall, a beautiful environment in the mid of a city center."
"We booked the Reading Room and requested a garden view, we got Room 7 - located right next to the lobby. It was a great view of the trees from the bed, and in the toilet. The toilet area was semi-outdoors, very unique and a totally different vibe from other hotels. You could “shower in nature” and basically get very good views anywhere in the room. The only thing is there’s no air conditioning in the toilet and bath area, but it was cooling throughout for us. My only complaint is that the rooms are not very soundproof so we could hear doors slamming in the mornings or people laughing at night. But overall, great stay! Really enjoyed myself."
"When it comes to a staycation, The first place that comes to my mind is LLOYDS inn.  This place is truly a home away from home. I truly embrace the tranquility and also the fact that LI makes me feel that I’m not in Singapore.  I also like the fact that the service is efficient and straight forward at the same time. Kelvin the friendly hotel manager knew that my partner and I were celebrating our anniversary prepared a hand written card and a lovely amenity in the room. The small gestures that really made the stay even more memorable.   The location is also a walking distance to several cafes and restaurants which makes it even more convenient. Later that evening we bought a bottle of wine back to the room. We called reception and asked for a wine opener. Lisa at reception was"
"My friend and I paid $258 for the BIG GARDEN ROOM for a 1-day stay after staycation is allowed in Singapore during the pandemic situation. We are locals and we always been wanting to visit this hotel after seeing reports of the renovation, highly praised reviews and of course pretty pictures online. I can only say that our high expectations fell short and it was a very disappointing experience. To reviewers who were impatient to read the elaborated review below, we suggest that you top up a bit more to stay in a proper hotel suite.  1- Check in As with other hotels, the check-in time for Llyod's is 3pm. We were there at around 3pm (of course to get the most time out of our stay), but we were told that our room was not ready yet. And the receptionist could not give us an"
"Love the high ceiling of the room which gives a very spaceous aspect to the room. The nature-oriented toilet is also a cool experience, though i won't be surprise some people might find it lack of privacy and you may encounter some insect during your bath (I've encountered a lizard friend).  Definitely a good boutique hotel for couples but not friends - the toilet is just segregated by transparent glass that can be see-through(if you know what i mean) Last but not least, the dipping pool is actually quite small and shallow - originally I wanted to enjoy the pool but after seeing the actual pool, i think it's better to grab beers/wine and chillax with a view instead😊"
"3D2N in Business Room  Room was dusty and chair was mouldy (refer to pics) Overall looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in a while We feedbacked to the staff and she apologised and said will feedback to housekeeping. No immediate remedy was given, housekeeping only came the next day but we already cleaned the place and our belongings were all over the place so we told the lady dont need.  Cleanliness is the basic for us so we were very disappointed - my partner in particular kept apologising to me because he picked the place and paid for it ($500+ in total btw) but honestly I feel bad for him. Imma lay out the pros and cons so you can decide for yourself cause it’s a nice place but it’s a pity it isn’t well maintained.  Pros: Hotel is in quiet part of town, supermarket less than 5"
"Relatively nice n tranquil place however soundproofing needs to be improved. We could hear the housekeeping staff esp during the whole noon and early morning and neighbours around us entire day and night. Also pls fix your toilet bowl as its leaking and the water is pretty all ard the toilet bowl floor area. Not very ideal and hygienic. Location wise is quite good except that it's totally bad if it rains. But well.. Breakfast is at nearby cafe but the breakfast package provided can be improved as its very limited choices. Apart from these, it's a pretty pleasant stay."
"My friend and I stayed in the business room and it was the perfect size. Overall, the room was really nice as they provided 2 bottles of water and fresh towels everyday.   If I could point out any bad points, it would be that when we got there the toilet was leaking and there were quite a few flying ants in our room. The breakfast is a short walk away which we didn't mind, but the free set only includes a drink and one pastry in which I had to top up extra cash for an iced latte.  Overall, we would still stay there again."
"My partner and I love exploring boutique hotels in Singapore and so it was just nice when we stumbled upon Lloyd's Inn in one of the articles online. We decided to book the Business Room so we could have more space and as we wanted to maximise our stay at Lloyd's.   Upon entering the room, I immediately noticed how it was relatively smaller than I expected. There was a work desk, office chair and 2 seater sofa, a fridge and complimentary bottled water for 2. Bed was overall comfortable and we had a relaxing sleep. The outdoor bath and toilet was interesting and we loved it at first until we heard our neighbors businesses.   The common pantry area was ok, we brought lunch and had it there. Note that the water dispensers are not available perhaps due to safety guidelines around"
Enjoyed my 2d1n staycation for my birthday via sky room. The front desk even gave a chocolate and a birthday card. Place was super cozy. Will come back again for another experience! Breakfast was out of the hotel but i love it too!
"Fantastic place for a nice quiet staycation just on the fringes of Orchard Road. The hotel was comfortable and clean. Reception was very easy and pleasant. And the breakfast at ABC was good, plus the coffee was very good.  Highly recommended for a staycation. Lots of nice small quaint restaurants along Killiney Road, a stone's throw from the hotel."
The experience with Lloyd's was a decent one however there were few things which we thought could make it better.   Cleanliness: We found strands of hair pretty much at a few parts of the room.  Bathroom: We stayed at the superior room and the bathroom was a semi outdoor standing rain shower setting. We felt it was a little too exposed to the nature as opposite the hotel is a mini forest and there were bugs and insects coming into the bathroom which doesn't feel that comfortable. We thought it would be good if there's a glass panel separating the outdoor and indoor.  Breakfast: We were rather disappointed with the breakfast as it just comes with a pastry and coffee. It just feels like a snack rather than a hearty breakfast. It was a disappointing end off.
"As a first time patron of the inn, I had a comfortable stay here at their Reading Room, the size was adequate for us and the personal touch of including a birthday card for me was an unexpected but welcome surprise indeed. The scenery was pleasant for the location and even though it rained during our stay, it added to the overall cozy atmosphere.   Overall, I had a pleasant experience with the staff and the inn itself, and came out of the stay refreshed and satisfied.  Would recommend to my friends, thank you!"
"Did a one night staycation with my boyfriend and it was a lovely stay in the Sky Room. The outdoor bathtub is really nice for a night soak and i love that the tub was very clean as well. We had a wonderful night's sleep, and the room was also spacious and clean. Soundproofing is not the best as we can hear what's going on outside the door but that did not really bother us as it wasn't too noisy. Location is a definite plus as we could easily walk to Orchard Road and back, with lots of entertainment and food options around."
"First time at the inn, I felt welcome by the receptionist.   The room is very clean and I love the concept of the room.   We decided to have lunch nearby Orchard road and it is just about 20 minutes walk from the Inn.  Overall I love the inn and definitely will come for another staycation .  Please keep up the great service and thanks to all the housekeeping team."
"Room was really clean, we loved the outdoors rain shower. It was a quiet getaway that was located very conveniently. From local hawker fare to restaurants a few minutes walk from Lloyd's, we had so many options. Saw how thorough the cleaning process was (man washing the area around the pool), which reassured us of the high hygiene standards. Will go back again."
"Staycation in this hotel was okay.   Enjoyed the zen-like the atmosphere of the place and the forestry like environment which makes the place a cosy hideout and retreat. Appreciate the huge platform bed and the nice raintree shower. Love the hotel scent and the zen music playing along the corridors. The hotel has a nice pantry with microwave oven and coffee machine (though it is non- functioning due to COVID 19) Standard room was decent and the bathroom was huge.   However, I guess, the flooring doesn’t match the ambience of the place. Cement flooring doesn’t gel well with the overall Zen-like environment. Not too sure about the cleanliness of the room slippers as they those reusable ones and hence, I didn’t use them. Check-in timing is at 3 pm (which is a bit later than most"
Was reading the past reviews for Lloyd's Inn and I saw the one by 'Unhappy guest' in Aug 2020 which was just last month. I had pretty much the same experience as them because I booked from Booking.com and got room #6 as well.   The windows were facing the residential area and you HAVE to pull down the blinds otherwise people living across will be able to look at whatever that is happening in your room. I used my phone to take a photo from outside the window to see if there were any privacy but I could actually see the inside of my room (although Lloyd's Inn staff told 'Unhappy guest' that there will be reflection so people outside cant see the inside of your room.) So there isn't any privacy unless you pull down the blinds but that would also defeat the purpose of having such
"I guess i had such high hopes for the hotel expecting a very zen, serene aesthetic atmosphere.   But i guess due to covid a lot of locals esp uncles aunties were staying there and the lobby was always seen with people from all walks of life.   I guess that kind of scars the brand of the hotel and i didnt feel my stay is as exclusive as i thought it would be.  Rather spend my money on a five star hotel then. With a big pool and room service.  Disappointed."
Hotel situated among residence area but quiet. Near to Killiney Road. Enjoyed the outdoor shower. Stayed in standard deluxe but was bigger than it looked in pictures. Room decor is minimalist style. The dipping pool and garden are IG worthy! The walls are thin so you need to turn on TV or music volume. Overall was a pleasant stay. Better to book direct. Would come back again!
"For someone who's stuck in SG and is unable to travel due to COVID-19 and would like to have something away from the bustling city, yet is easily accessible to amenities, this is the perfect choice! We chose the sky room and it was a very pleasant stay. Thank you! :)"
"1. Gotten room #6 which is facing the residential estate with privacy risk being exposed. 2. The window is technically non-existent since the binds need to be down all the time unless you don’t mind being seen by residences staying opposite or passerby. Furthermore, there is a gap about 5cm wide that runs in the middle, in between the 2 binds. 3. Requested for a room change and was rejected due to full occupancy. Was told by front desk that rooms facing the opposite direction (grass patch), priority goes to direct booking guest (you are 2nd class citizen if you are not a direct booking guest) 4. Front desk mentioned in the morning there is reflection so residences opposite can’t see and in the night if you off the light, passerby can’t view through from the gap.  5. Not sure who"
"Loved my stay! It’s in a great location, which is really near to town - about 10min walk or so. But still secluded enough for it to be peaceful with calm nature vibes. While it’s a small facility, i’ve enjoyed my time thoroughly. The staff were really friendly. Loved my stay!"
"Came to the hotel before check in time to drop our bags and was told that our room is ready for check in. So we managed to check in earlier and was upgraded to the business room instead of the garden/reading room. Thank you for the upgrade, it surely made our honeymoon experience even more memorable.   The environment around the hotel were very quiet and there were a lot of privacy even though we were in the heart of orchard area. Will surely recommend couples to have a short staycation here.   Thank you once again to the team at Lloyd's Inn."
"A walk away from town, near lots of food options. A quiet, comfortable & simple place & a lovely way to spend a gathering of friends. Sleep was quiet and comfortable too! Staff were super helpful and friendly, and reception was 24/7."
Very minimalist design room where the hotel is surrounded by thick greenery surroundings. Gives a very relaxing feel to our staycation. Definitely a highly recommended place for couples. Location is good where breakfast is taken at a cafe 5min away and  with other options of food along Killney road. Else talke a longer walk to TrippleOne Somerset or Orchard Central
"Llyod's Inn will be your favourite boutique hotel if you want to avoid human crowd and still be in the city. 8mins walk to Mohamed Sultan Road/Robertson Quay for meals, not as inconvenient as I initially thought.   The hotel was relaunched in 2014. Since then, I've been interested to book a short stay with them. Fast forward to 2020, we finally booked The Garden Room to celebrate our 8th anniversary.  There's a lot of natural light, green plants and keeping its minimalist essence. The furnishing are well maintained,  room was also clean. Every bit was Instagram worthy! Besides that, we could pair the in-room TV to our mobile for Netflix.  It really was a good gateaway. We slept in, checked out and head over for our late breakfast. Complimentary breakfast(meal coupons) was not"
"Overall it is a very special stay with beautifully designed of the whole space and the concept of the room that link us back with the nature. I like the concept of the greenery and minimalist design, especially the outdoor bathtub and shower are the main highlight of our stay. However, I found that they should try to maintain their room better with what they have charged us for. Our room have one faulty light and the furniture, walls should have a better maintenance, other than that it's a very nice stay with the quiet and serenity environment. The sound proof of the room is quite bad as we can heard people talking outside. Besides, we need to shut the door hardly as it can't lock properly. The breakfast that they in-corporate with do serve very nice breakfast (you need to top"
"Lloyd's Inn Singapore is the kind of place where you want to get out from your usual daily routine and wake up with a different view. I am rating this as one of the best staycations I had in Singapore.   True enough the rooms are small, nothing much to mention, nothing on the extra ordinary. That said, my title for this review. You'll love how this hotel is so simple yet comfortable and has its own characteristics. It's simply the heaven for minimalist. Can't wait to try the other rooms that comes with a big tub.   I book the Reading Room. Despite the room size which is small, expect quality beddings and you gotta love the bathroom. I would not recommend long stays for this hotel as it's not really accessible for short walks. Yes, it's still possible to walk to Orchard Road"
"A perfect place for staycation,great value for money. I booked this hotel for our wedding anniversary and stayed for one night. It cost around 138sgd for the garden room.   The room is minimalist and spacious as well as their outdoor shower/bathroom. Dont worry its still private/safe/relaxing experience as you can hear the water running from the fountain. Clean linen, comfortable bed resulting to a good night’s sleep  They have a  small recycleable water bottle carton which you can refill along the hallway and also have outdoor pantry which have ice water dispenser,  coffee and microwave oven.   We’ve also experienced great food around this area of Killiney Road such as Artisan Boulangerie Co for Breakfast, Pastry and Coffee. Marutama for Ramen and Fook Kin for their crispy pork"
"Minimalist, Zen, Relaxation, Clean, Comfortable, Good Location is the keyword of the Hotel.  Lovely hidden gem in the center of the City.  We love looking at the sunshine thru both of the patio outside the room and bathroom,  shadow of the fern and plants are a beautiful touch.  Waking up with birds chirping, tranquil environment, beautiful garden and seating corners....what not to love? Besides, lots of eatery along Killiney Road with walking distance to Somerset MRT.  Highly recommend!"
"Had being seeing instagram post of Llody’s Inn for a very long time. It was until recently, that when planning for a short staycation, that wondered why not give it a try?  The place was super accessible to nearby amenities, with plenty of food choice within walking distance.  Rooms were pretty decently cleaned and we would like to thanks the staff for upgrading our room from the premium rooms to the Patio room, for our anniversary.  We are always on the look out for a place, where we can go back, annually and now with Llody’s Inn discovered, this could be it."
Have a good time and relaxing day during our stay  Very recommended place to stay in SG   The garden so fantastic just like bali life  The room so comfortable ..  love all those things in the hotel  Thank you guys  See you very soon
"Comfortable beds with quality linens, perfect for a good nights sleep after a long journey or a day of sightseeing. Great location as it’s a stones throw to 2 metro stops or walking distance to some great areas.  Garden and pool area are a nice place to kick back and relax or read a book. Little breakfast at the bakery down the street was a delicious start to the day as well!"
"I stayed in the Business room so it comes in a duplex setting. The highlight would be the outdoor shower as you feel you are one with nature. The Room size if comfortable and with the bed on the second floor, you do feel that you are going to sleep as you ""leave"" your worries behind as you head up stairs. The staff was very friendly and I even got cookies and newspaper delivered to my room. The location is also a plus as it is rather close to Somerset MRT. Really an escape from the urban city. Overall a good place to stay."
"Of all the hotels I’ve ever stayed in, Lloyd’s Inn is officially my favourite. The rooms are much bigger than they appear in the photos, are beautifully designed with comfortable beds, pleasant lighting, and the indoor/outdoor bathroom was fantastic. The robes were a nice touch as well, wish I could have taken mine home!  The staff were very friendly and helpful. The outdoor terrace and larder were nice additions. It was great to be able to get filtered water whenever we wanted, we filled the reusable bottles and cartons that were in the room which saved us money on buying bottled water all day while we were out. WiFi was good and strong.  There is no onsite restaurant, but you get vouchers which grant you a free breakfast of delicious coffee and pastries at a bakery at the"
"We had a lovely stay at Lloyd’s inn. The staff were super friendly and really helpful. I found it quite cute and quirky and especially loved the open shower aspect. It’s is not super luxury but thought it was great value for money. Everything was relatively easy to access either by public transport or taxi. The included breakfast was vouchers for a coffee and pastry at a cafe down the road, however, if you wished you could use them to upgrade to the A La Cart menu at a discounted price (you can also use more than one at a time for more of a discount we had left over vouchers on our last day so didn’t have to pay for our meal or drinks at all). Pool was quite small but nice for a dip. The only downfall we could find was the lighting in the room was a little dim. Otherwise a very"
"The location is on a quiet leafy street near to local eateries, useful supermarket and just 20 minute walk to Clarke Quay or 15 minutes walk to Fort Canning Park.The staff on the reception desk were charming and very helpful. We arrived at 9am and were able to leave our luggage safely while we went off to explore until the room was ready. The spacious room had a shower open to the outdoors but in the warmth and humidity of Singapore this quirky feature seemed to work. However, the air conditioning was noisy at night                                                          The decor although very plain was in keeping with the stripped back minimalist feel. We didn't use the 'cooling pool' but the greenery and sound of water from the fountain was a pleasant feature.   Breakfast"
"The place is a real compromise between location / comfort / size and money. Location is fine for those who enjoy lengthy ""walking tours"" (I do, and my 9-years-old son does). You can start from Orchard Road and walk towards the Downtown Core and Marina Bay, passing most of the main Singapore sites, belonging to both past and future. But that will surely take time and you will have to make a few breaks. In terms of comfort, the hotel just offers basics, but all the necessary basics are there - including umbrellas to use in case of rain, and a pool which is too shallow to really swim but enough to cool off on a hot afternoon. Sizes are really small - in our room, we didn't even un-pack since it was nowhere to put all the stuff. To have breakfast you have to walk for three minutes"
"What a great little place, only a few minutes walk from Orchard Road and all the shopping malls and restaurants.  Easy access to everywhere. Fantastic staff, nothing was too much trouble.  Beautiful small gardens, good sized rooms, spotlessly clean.  Only thing to note is that the beds are up on a platform which makes getting in and out of bed more of a rolling out of bed action.   But we're in our 60's and it didn't cause us a problem.  Voucher for breakfast at the Artisan Bakery Company (2 minutes walk) - great choice of food and the voucher can be used against anything on the menu."
"Checked in on the 24th January 2020. Greeted with a warm smile by the staff at the reception. The staff asked what’s the occasion for the stay, and I was giving a surprise birthday celebration for my hubby. Went out to run errands and upon coming back to the room, the staff gave a birthday card and a chocolate for my hubby. Room was superb, was complimentary upgraded to a bigger room. Toilet and shower facilities are clean and well maintained. Will return again in the future for more staycation. Thank you Lloyds Inn, me and hubby had a pleasant stay with you guys! Awesome team!"
"Spending 3 nights in a business trip had been a pleasant experience overall although the place needs an urgent revamping and a better care. I liked the freedom flexibility concept, the room’s layout with the bathroom garden. Poor finishes and furniture (Ikea accessories), noisy air conditioning, overall derelict with a twist of abandoned especially at the garden around and the common areas. Very nice neighborhood in quite location, taxi rides required for moving. Breakfast formula not very comfy as requires to go out of the hotel. Reception assistants very helpful.  All considered -and for that price- I expected more."
"This hotel is in a nice area, about 10 mins walk from Somerset MRT. The room was clean, minimalist, but wih a very comfortable bed and a fantastic shower, which is a boon in Singapore. The wifi went down for 24 hours whilst we were here but at other times the signal was very strong. The staff are friendly. The downsides are, no bar, no food provision and the room safe was hopeless. You could pick it up and stick it in your case! You are given tokens for breakfast which are redeemed at the Artisan Boulangerie Co. at the end of the road. We thought it was good value for money."
We stayed at Lloyd's Inn for a night and we were very sad to leave. The hotel is stylish and different and the staff is very helpful. It's 5 mins from orchard road and is in a lovely neighborhood. Will definitely come back here.
"As mentioned in the title of my review , this is my second time staying in Lloyd's Inn with my boyfriend.   I chose one of their more luxurious room as a birthday treat for my partner and it was definitely a worthy decision. The minimalist concept is comfortable and soothing , a refreshing break from the usual hectic work routine. I enjoyed everything about the design of the room , from the outdoor sitting balcony and outdoor shower space (spacious bathtub) to the main interior space. Though i must admit , the second storey in the room does not seem to serve much purpose for our visit this time round. It probably may suit couples / travelers travelling for business purpose better with the spacious long table with a window facing outside for natural sunlight to do work.  I love"
love the outdoorshower and cozy platform bed. enjoyed a few cups of coffee with their cappacino latte machine each morning. pool very relaxing and loved that i could shower before my late evening flight. And the food at ABC bakery is terrific!highly recommend this little gem of a hotel!
"Nice hotel, with a great design. Well located, with a metro station on a 10 minutes walk. Despite being outside of the hotel, the breakfast is in a nice bakery and is also good. Great choice to stay in Singapore"
"Great ambience especially for couples. The room makes us feel very comfortable and cosy. Enjoyed the stay very much! Staffs were all very helpful and friendly, always doing their best to accede to all requests.  Appreciate it a lot! Thank you so much!"
Celebrated my cousin's birthday. Staff were professional and friendly. Room was clean. Ambience of hotel made me feel like i wasnt in the heart of the city. Thank you to everyone at Lloyd's Inn for making my cousin's birthday a memorable one!
"Even more than the beautiful garden, simple but efficient room, amazing bathroom - I recommend this hotel for the hospitality of the team.  I arrived by early morning, I could take a shower and refresh, store my luggage and relax in the garden waiting for my room to be ready. Also, the very kind lady at the reception gave me the directions to the right place, so I could buy kind of specific equipment.  I felt very welcome.  Highly recommend this place."
"Very clean and confortable room. Very helpful staff. Has a nice pool. Breakfast located in a Cafe down the road, includes beverage and a patissery. Good location, 5 min walk from Orchard gateway or somerset mrt."
"It was a good hotel, located ok, but with extremly friendly people and a good service!  The breakfast is 5min by feet away and you’ll get with a voucher coffee and something oft the bakery.  ++ personal ++ clearness   + breakfast  = located"
"Staff were really friendly, the upkeep of the rooms were very modern and minimalist sort of design, really quiet in the surrounding place as well. Environmental friendly by using recycleable carton waterbottles which we can refill right outside our room. Went for dinner nearby, great choices of 13% Gastro Wine and Foo Kin. Highly recommend this hidden gem in orchard."
"This is a very nice place. I wanted  a little peace and quiet in the buzz of Singapore and Lloyd's really delivered. The room was simple and minimal, with Japanese/Scandi touches. The staff were helpful and welcoming. It was relaxing and I will definitely stay here again soon. There are many fun places to eat on Killiney Rd and there's a big supermarket just around the block."
"Overall, not a bad experience, but not a great one either.  The hotel itself is well located close to Orchard Rd and public transport options, the service was good and the pool area is nice.  But the room we had was slightly damp and not as clean as I would have expected it to be (we found dust, ants and hair between the twin beds), given the image that Lloyd's Inn portrays of being minimalist but good quality. I had higher expectations of this balance between minimalism and quality.  If they had charged slightly less (we paid approx. SGD200 per night for a twin garden room), I wouldn't have minded my experience. As a comparison, there are other hotels in Singapore that are of a similar level of quality (or better) that charge less per night. So I was slightly disappointed that"
"The main appeal of this hotel was great location near to Orchard road and Somerset MRT. The hotel itself had a minimalistic but very cool aesthetic, with a pool and garden with sitting areas. We loved the outdoor shower, it was a unique touch. There were also lots of thoughtful touches including coming home and finding chocolate and cookies as complimentary gifts. The free breakfast of a coffee and pastry at ABC co was enjoyable - the pastry was very yummy, however could have been more substantial.   The only (very minor) negative of our stay were the thin walls, which meant mornings could be quite noisy with people coming and going."
"The staff is friendly, responsive and generous. They gave me cookies and a birthday card even though we only stayed a night.  Location is great, super close to Somerset. We also loved the concept and the design of the rooms, it was minimalist without being spartan. Beds could be more comfortable but it’s not a big issue."
Very trendy small boutique Inn. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The plunge pool was great and surrounds were lush. You can use the pool at anytime. Rooms were trendy if a bit small. Air on was noisy but very cool. Linen etc was nice.  breakfast at a local cafe was very authentic but take your tissues and wipes as these are not provided. Overall very good.
"Located in a quiet neighbourhood, this accommodation in a villa with its minimalist design and simple bedrooms is a hidden jewel far away from the big towers hotels.   People at the frontdesk were very friendly and helpfull when needed.  The breakfast is served outside and a bit faraway from the hotel (about 300 m)."
"I liked everything about this hotel. It's in a pleasant neighborhood and an easy walk from a train station, the front desk people were extremely nice and helpful, and the room was spotless and quiet. I arrived early in the day, and they not only stored my luggage but also provided a place where I could shower and change--very welcome after a 15-hour flight."
"Stayed at Lloyds again (for the third time ) on Saturday night Sept 14 on the way back from Thailand to Brisbane. Our niece lives a short walk away. Given the position near Orchard Road Lloyds is the best value for location in the city. Great room, very clean, superb bed and great staff. Minimalist décor, outdoor showers (totally private) beautify gardens and plunge pool. Supermarket and varied eateries shot walk away. Can't recommend Lloyds Inn highly enough. Fantastic"
"The staff here are so friendly and welcoming. Had a lot of local knowledge, and were more than happy to organise a few things on my behalf while I was there. Couldn't be happier with the way I was treated, and my room was divine."
"My husband and I spent 4 nights here. We got an upgrade which I was grateful for. The hotel had everything we needed and we liked the minimalistic space. you could hear noise in the hallway quite clearly, but got used to it. 8 minute walk to subway, but we found it quite central to all the major things we wanted to see. We skipped the breakfast, it didn't look that appealing, but we found a great french patisserie in the Orchard mall near by that made a yum bircher muesli. Would stay here again."
"We spent 3 nights in Singapur in this hotel. From the photo and the reviews that we read, we expected something more. Our room was quite big but we got an upgrade so we didn’t see the real measure of a normal bedroom. The furniture is basic, nothing amazing, the outside shower and bath were nice and kind of relaxing. The cleanness was really good. They changed the bedlinen every day and we got every day fresh bath towel. Regards the breakfast, you have to go with coupon in a bar near the hotel, a typical Asian. However, the breakfast is not recommendable at all. The hotels location is ok, like 10 minutes walking from the Metro station."
"The hotel is located within minutes from Somerset MRT station with several eateries located about 250m away from the hotel, which are comfortable for the wallet. Even though it is situated in the heart of Singapore famous shopping belt, the surroundings are peaceful and quiet. Perfect for a short getaway.   However, both my boyfriend and I feel that the hotel is a little overpriced with limited and basic amenities. We also skipped the complimentary breakfast offered by the partnering coffee shop. Overall service is good with friendly staff. Worth a stay."
"My husband and I are regular visitors of Singapore and have tried out a few hotels and airbnbs in Singapore already. Lloyd’s Inn is the best so far! Can’t wait to go back!  First of all, the lady of the reception (we didn’t get her name, but please give her a raise) who checked us in was incredibly kind. Secondly, we got a free upgrade to the skyroom which was amazing. We wanted to get a late checkout which was not possible due to another reservation, but the nice receptionist offered us to stay ‘till 1 pm and when we come back at the end of the day we could freshen up.  Thirdly, the room was amazing with an outside bathtub (could not ask for more). The details in the room clearly show that they paid attention to all the details.  Lastly, because of the quietness and all the"
"dunno why but I got a room upgrade (which is nice), around 10 minutes walk to orchard road, quiet neighborhood, the staff are helpful and informative, definitely on my top hotel list if plan to visit Singapore again, overall a very pleasant stay"
"Excellent location, less than 10 minutes walk from the Somerset area. The decor is minimalist and absolutely beautiful with lots of greenery. Favourite feature of the room would definitely have to be the full window behind the bed - what a view.   We had the reading room, which was slightly small but still suitable for two people. Bed was so comfortable, but unfortunately the sheets were stained. We requested for the sheets to be changed twice before deciding all their sheets were probably stained anyway. Definitely don’t doubt that the sheets were clean, but the stains did disappoint. The staff were very gracious, however, and pleasant and understanding.   There aren’t a lot of amenities within the property apart from a shared coffee machine and a fountain/pool - too shallow to"
We had recently got engaged and the hotel very kindly upgraded up for free when they heard about it. The staff were very welcoming and the hotel was superbly situated by Orchard Road. Breakfast was around the corner at a local cafe and this was the only disappointing part of our trip as it just wasn't for us.
"I have previously stayed here and loved it. This time around not so much. The room is good, minimalistic which I do not mind as it is in warm wood and concrete.  I loved the bakery breakfast option last time but upon check in was told it was their last day so that breakfast option was dead in the water. Their first breakfast option doesn’t appeal to us as its in an overheated open busy Asian styled breakfast cafe so we had to buy breakfast elsewhere each day even though we payed for breakfast as part of this, so that did not go down well with me. I felt a bit cheated as I don’t believe the hotel only found out the bakery was closing mere seconds before we got there.  I would have chosen somewhere else had the hotel pre warned us.  The pool area is delightful as always but I"
"Checkin experience was good and staff friendly and welcoming. I reported that a power point wasn’t working and this wasn’t addressed whilst I stayed there. We specifically booked this property as their included breakfast options included a bakery which we have previously used and enjoyed. We were advised on checkin that the bakery was closing on the 1st day of our stay. Now, if we had been communicated this prior to our stay, we would not have stayed here and would have booked elsewhere. The other option was packed every day and we couldn’t get a table as this cafe is also very popular with locals. We were also charged $100 deposit upon checkin. Don’t know why this was $100 as this property doesn’t have anything to charge back to the room. No mini bar or room service. They are"
Loves the big garden room it was very spacious and clean. Bed linen smells great and staffs were friendly :D complimentary cookies were very nice as well :) a good place to rest and relax after a Long and hustle week. Hope to be back again!!
"very nice place, minimalist decoration , clean and comfy rooms. the half outdoor shower was a delight. the pool and garden very nice and quite location not bad, metro station not far. the service though seems pretty minimalist also, since you don t have breakfast nor other service you feel sometimes it lacks some human touch. they give you 2 breakfast options, one we liked a lot (killeney Kopitiam), much less the other overall it s super worth it since the price is very fair , specially for Singapore rates"
