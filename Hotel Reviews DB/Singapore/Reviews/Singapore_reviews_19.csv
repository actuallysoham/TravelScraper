"Went to this place together with my family and utilised the SG vouchers to booked for 3 rooms. As we are driving, this hotel offered free parking. We arrived earlier than the check-in time and immediately the counter staff assist us in the check-in. There is a little bit of walking from the hotel entrance to the room though. The room is clean, with a bean bag inside and a small TV. There is complimentary wifi, water bottles and coffee machine provided. Hot water is almost instant, bed is comfy & soft while the air-con isn't too cold. We liked the fact that it is located away from the city and that it is more near to nature. It is unfortunate that Changi Boardwalk is closed for some upgrading work at the moment but Changi Village is still within walking distance away. The room"
"i've been in this hotel a few years ago, & had good memories, but this time was a little different. i like the fact that it's a modern hotel in faraway Changi. i'd booked the room type specifically for that hanging cocoon chair, but what what i got was a crappy bean bag instead, & the room was facing a military installation so the windows are frosted up. i can't decide if not having a window or having a frosted window that could only be opened a little was more depressing."
"We had a 3D2N staycation with a 7yr old and 3yr old. The hotel is tied up to ‚ÄúChangi Civil Service Club‚Äù so you had variety of things to enjoy. We enjoyed swimming, bowling, playing by the beach, sand playground, nature walk. The hotel loan as a board games that kids enjoyed playing..We havent done biking though it will be a good one due to the nature PCN pathways. Shout out to Uncle Rahim, Juani, Alisya, Li Ping and Ritz who assisted us from welcome , our rooms and breakfast."
"Very nice atmosphere. Serene location to be out of the hustle and bustle of city life. Room facilities are very clean and confortable. Close proximity to changi boardwalk. Can walk, take free shuttle or bus to changi village. Great place for getaway and family staycation."
"Good location hotel that surrounded by nature. There are some huge and tall trees in the hotel area. Near to the beach club, boardwalk, (haunted) old changi hospital, changi village.  Restaurant is quite decent but the breakfast was to simple and worth to skip and find it outside if expect better breakfast to cheer up your day. Room quality is fine with the price range, but during high season can feel the lack of manpower to clean up the room as we found that the floor inside the room was very dusty."
"Came in at 9 am, trying for early checked in as suggested by her colleague when we booked the room. On the actual day room is not even ready by 1.30 pm. Checked few times and SOP answer given ""our standard check in time is 3pm."", without even trying to check with their house keeping team how long more room is ready, while she was just seated all the time while no other customer. 0 customer experience, no compassion."
The quietness is rare in busy Singapore. We appreciated this during our staycation. Was disappointed to find out that there was no mini fridge in the room. Room was comfortable and adequate. The breakfast was huge! Enough to last till late afternoon. We appreciate the friendly staff who manned the temperature taking counter. He never failed to greet guests and was always willing to help out.
This property is located in peaceful Changi area. Major point of interest are Changi Point Boardwalk and Changi Village where the hawkers sell very tasty local foods.  Hotel is quiet and very slow pace compare to others hotels in the downtown area. Room is nice and shower water pressure is strong. Breakfast was Okay coffee ‚òïÔ∏è was good.   Will return again.
"My family took a staycation here during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hotel is situated in the tranquil Changi area away from the bustle of Changi Village, yet easily accessible to the many shops, eateries and Pulau Ubin ferries via a bus or short walk.  Changi Cove has a couple of blocks to it and there was some walking and a couple of flights of stairs or two elevators to get our rooms (our kids had their own room). However, there is a lot of nature along the way so the walk is qhite pleasant.  The rooms were rather comfy with decent amenities like kettle, toiletries, TV and coffee maker. However, although there is a safe, there are no mini bars in the room.  The beds are comfy and the towels are, for this budget of hotel, surprisingly fluffy and soft. Each room also comes with a"
"This was supposed to be a great place and there were many pictures in the website to prove it too.  We didn't realize until we checked-in how much it has been affected by the pandemic. Glory was pretty much gone. There were lot of evidences to indicate that the hotel was primarily serving 'stay home notices' few months back.  Rooms are very small but well cleaned. Other amenities were all right. View from the room was poor. Windows weren't property cleaned either.  No room service. Restaurant had limited capacity and very limited menu.  This hotel is not very far from Changi Village, where there is no limit to food options.  Perhaps it will return to its original state in the future."
"Our group was well taken care of by your team. Will highlight efforts especially of the front desk & restaurant wait staff. Alvist & Sierra left an impression, camaraderie was good.  Would be great if you would enhance the stairs connecting lobby-level2-incubatorlevel with motion sensor lighting. We do climb the stairs especially when it‚Äôs just 1 flight we‚Äôre conquering."
6 noteworthy findings during my staycation:  1) merely 2 mins walk to the start of the Changi Boardwalk through the lush landscape leading to the Changi Beach. The boardwalk leads to Coachman Inn restaurant where you can dine with the 180 degree view of the Changi Beach.  2) delivery of what we ordered at The Olive Tree to the comfort of our rooms. Just like room service! Olive Tree staff was very enthusiastic. The Danish pastries served is good.  3) The hotel is a quiet and beautiful sanctuary. The bed is very comfortable. The room is very clean and well-maintained! Possibly the only hotel in Singapore with a ceiling to floor doodle board. The writings are easily wiped off with just a wet cloth provided.    4) Fast technician support when we asked for an extra chair and
"I am disappointed that the reception of this hotel is not welcoming.   I am totally ok with respecting the covid rules, but it shouldn't mean being rude with customers, not smiling to the clients and not doing any effort to offer the quality of services we are expecting.  There is no tourist in SG, that is why the money of the people living in SG is important for the hotels. I will not return.  Not a good experience at all üòè"
"It should always start with a great welcoming from the staff. That was completely missed. The guy at the check in counter was cold as ice, not smiling, and only interested in getting our passeports and credit card. There are better ways to welcome visitors, especially during the pandemic.  Then, the room is not very fancy, quite cold...  The staff at the bar/restaurant were ok, but again, not a single smile.  I would not recommend at all this hotel for a staycation in Singapore, despite its location, so close to the fantastic Changi boardwalk."
"Stayed here a year ago and returned again for a weekend staycation.   Hotel occupancy was healthy, considering that there were no weddings and corporate events in light of Covid-19 measures.   Staff were polite, prompt and efficient in enforcing safe distancing measures while attending to guest needs.   Menus are now contactless (scanning a QR code brings you to an online menu), and breakfast served on a plate (you can ask to switch some of the components, e.g. have milk and cornflakes instead of egg. Hand sanitisers are installed throughout the hotel.   Friendly doorman greeted everyone and took their temperature. Had ready advice on weather and fishing opportunities.  I'll be back!"
"Hotel staff are good; rooms are clean and Changi is calm place. But there is not much to do in the hotel if you are planning a staycation esp. with young children. It is hard to understand why a 4 hectare property doesn't have its own Swimming pool and Gym (have to use it at neighboring club: Covid period robbed this opportunity also)! Also, TV doesn't have any kids channels. A special book in the room, good breakfast, helpful frontdesk (including the uncle keeping doors) are pleasant experiences... and probably the reason why I gave an extra star."
"Booked a standard King room, bed was comfortable, adequate room size and bathroom has an inviting white and wood minimalist deco. There is a Nespresso machine with two complimentary capsules and some chocolates to welcome us. Hotel Staff are nice and friendly. In-house guests can use the very-nearby Changi beach club pool to swim and its just a 3 mins walk away to the starting point of Changi Broadwalk. Great place for nature lovers and birders to spot birds. We truly enjoyed our stay at Changi cove"
"My friend and I went on an 11-day SE Asia cruise out of Singapore and flew in 3 days early for some pre-cruise sightseeing. We had planned to go to Shanghai post-cruise but cancelled that segment, not because we thought we‚Äôd get sick but because some flights in and out of China were already being cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak and we didn‚Äôt want to get stranded. We booked additional time in Singapore and we  chose the Chsngi Cove Hotel because the rates at our first hotel jumped way up. This is a really nice place, very clean and modern, with spacious rooms, a pleasant coffee shop and a nice courtyard. Desk is staffed 24/7 which is a huge plus. Staff members are very friendly and helpful - they‚Äôll book taxis and restaurant reservations and print out your travel docs"
"I chose to stay here as an alternative from an expensive airport hotel. It isn‚Äôt very close to the airport though: I‚Äôd pre-booked a taxi and it wasn‚Äôt cheap. However, it is in a quiet location and I enjoyed exploring the boardwalk by the bay ‚Äì although the signs warning about how to deal with packs of dogs were rather disconcerting! The gardens of the hotel were pretty but there wasn‚Äôt a view of the sea although it is nearby. The room was simple but comfortable. The receptionist guided me how to take public transport by bus and metro to the centre of Singapore. Although the hotel takes individual guests they‚Äôre obviously set up more for catering for large groups."
"Great hotel. It is somewhat away from the city center but you get a much lower rate than in town. The rooms are quite ok and clean. Unless you want to spend most of your stay in the hotel this is a good place to stay. It shares facilities with the nearby Beach Club (Pool and Gym), but it has a sufficiently extensive breakfast buffer and soom decent lunch and dinner options. It is near (1.5 km) Changi Village which is a pleasant walk and where you have a large variety of local food stalls. Taxi to town takes about S$25 one way and Grab is about the same. Under 15 minutes to the airport."
"We had a lovely stay at Changi Cove, that was made wonderful with the attentive staff. Would like to mention Mr.Rahim who stands by the doors, in the lounge area to greet guests in the morning at breakfast, and when we checked out. His genuine smile and warmth touched our hearts and made the stay even more so meaningful."
"We stayed here for two nights, in between flying from the UK and going out to Aus. The room was very clean, quiet and dark, the beds were really comfortable - so we had two good sleeps. The breakfast was great, and the staff were very kind and helpful. We got soaked in heavy rain on the Changi Boardwalk nearby when out sightseeing for the day, and although we'd checked out (we had an evening flight) they provided towels to dry off.  Changi Village / hawker centre and Changi Museum are close by. It's a 15 min bus ride to the MRT to the centre of Singapore, so we found it a great place to stay."
"We were so glad we chose to break up our journey and stay at Changi Cove, it was just perfect for us! 24 hour reception, excellent staff, a very nice breakfast, clean & cool room...everything was just great. We struggled to get a large taxi van to the airport but the staff were kind enough to help us with that. I couldn't fault our stay - well done Changi Cove!"
"I had a 21hr stopover and all the transit hotels in airport were full. I had my nephew look for a hotel and book it for me from overseas.  At 2am I was at the reception ready to pay the $94.00 advertised on booking.com. I was half asleep but when the receptionist announced the price of $260.00 I got wide awake, nearly having a stroke. I showed her the advertised price and she said because it is from the booking agency. She knew that I was stranded and they must do this often because it was so easy and so natural for her to invent a price.   As I was getting there I noticed another hotel the Raintr33 and I grabbed my luggege and walked out. The half bold manager became somewhat rude.  I do not know how the hotel is but I would not go there anymore and I suggest you too stay far"
"It was just for a night between flights. Although the hotel is in Changi, just as the airport, to get here (15min by taxi) it doesn't take much less than to go into the city center. The taxi charged me 20 SGD, on the way back 13 SGD.  Staff at reception was friendly, but I am glad I arrived not too late in the evening, since the restaurant 'White Olive', just opposite the reception, closes at 10pm and there is nowhere elso to go nearby. At 9pm for dinner I was all by myself, eating my 'Mee Goreng'. The attending lady was extremely friendly, and I also enjoyed the rich breakfast buffet, with fresh fruit, Swiss Premium Yoghurt (by Emmi), smoked salmon, camembert, freshly prepared eggs to order, various cooked Asian dishes.  Access to the room is the most complicated I have seen"
Stayed at changi cove from 9am to 6pm. Initially wanted to stay from 9am to 3pm ( $110 nett ) but decided to extend 3 more hours to 6pm (extra $30 for 3 hours ). The staff was efficient. Overall the stay was good and surroundings were very very peaceful and quiet. I didnt like the fact that i had to stayed at 6th floor. Had to walk quite a distance from 2nd floor and the linkway to the room was abit too far.
"Decided to go for a quiet 3 days/2 nights retreat. Choose Changi Cove as it is well located in the midst of nowhere... Changi is one end of Singapore, rustic, good place to go for a slow walk. Changi Cove is well built for silent retreat. Checking in was smooth and the counter staff are very courteous, helpful, and efficient. Went to the room that is simple but functional. Bathroom is clean and cosy. Started the stay well. Managed to take a walk along Changi Point Boardwalk in the morning of my 2nd day. Nice and easy 18 minutes walk from Changi Beach Club to Changi Sailing Club another 18 minutes back, nice and scenic walk. Breakfast spread (included in the package) is good and appetizing. Had a good 2 days of reflection. Only shortcoming is the window in the room is lock and 2"
"I used to stay at Village Hotel Changi, but decided to give Changi Cove a go. I was not disappointed.   The hotel is a little on the no-frills side - think along the lines of ""clean, modern, simple"". Our stay was a refreshing break from the city, helped by the fact that the hotel was set amidst the jungle canopy.   The breakfast spread was moderate, but the dishes were good. To get to the pool (on the premises of Changi Beach Club), you'll need to take a 200m walk.  The staff were friendly and prompt, and morale seemed high.   I'll definitely be back!"
In our mind this is a great place for an overnight stay if transiting through Singapore. Check in was fine. The rooms are a bit of a trek to get to but having been there before we were fine. We had dinner here this time. Meals were very nice. Breakfast was ok but nothing special. It was only a $12 SGD trip in a Grab car (think Uber). Will definitely stay here again if needed.
"The most amazing visit, welcomed by your Concierge who is truly brilliant, the food was fabulous. Spotlessly clean and so helpful. The visit was great and we walked to Changi Village and Hawker Center, we will return again. Only one disappointment Changi jail was shut."
Stayed one night in a Deluxe King room with hubby for a quiet respite from the hustle of the city.  The location of hotel is right at the quiet corner of Changi Village. We enjoyed our stay pretty much.  Loved the serenity of the place.  The hotel is a short walk to the famous Changi Village for all the yummy food and beach.  Hotel is quite accessible via private hire or taxis.  There are bus service at the Changi Village area.   Room is clean and the bathroom is clean and well maintained.  The hotel rooms are located at another building thus one need to walk some distance before reaching the hotel block.  The distance is very minimal though.  It is sheltered so no worries if it rains.  The breakfast spread is not too bad.  The thing that stood out in this hotel and differs from
"We stayed here for one night to break up the flights to Europe from Australia.  It is comfortable and clean, and handy to Changi Airport. There is a small restaurant on site which is OK if you don't want to leave the premises.  The coastal walk is pleasant and it's relaxing to be away from the city."
"Location is quiet but the room is extremely small and not clean!! there are stanis on our bedsheets and room is also very dusty, they certainly need to improve on their room cleaning. Nice if you want to stay near the airport"
"Admittedly an emergency stay after a missed flight, but a few annoying features.  Breakfast did not start until 7.00am, so don't go if you need an early start. The hotel actually takes the deposit and has to refund as opposed to cancel, so check your credit card statements (according to the receptionist,7 - 14 days). The passage to the room is like solving the labyrinth. Two lifts and a healthy walk. If you need a quick overnight stay, just be aware of this hotel's idiosyncrasies."
"Really quaint and cosy rooms with neat features like a bean bag, hammock chair and ""doodle wall"" for the children with beautiful tropical scenery. Pod espresso coffee is provided in the room! The service  on arrival and at breakfast was great. Nice big bathroom. Beds were OK. Breakfast was sufficient. The hotel generously offered extra water bottles for our children when we asked. The hotel has an unusual layout, best if you don't mind a walk. And if you don't mind the travel time from Changi (15 mins), this hotel is a pretty decent option for a quick layover. Airconditioning was slow, however did eventually cool the room down. No refrigerator is offered."
"Changi Cove is a nice hotel surrounded by luxuriant gardens. It is a 35 minutes walk to Changi Village by the scenic boardwalk or 20 minutes following the road (many buses passing by). Rooms are modern and comfortable, and there is a rather nice breakfast buffet. Service was very friendly. Its is the less expensive option in Changi. I have stayed many times at the Village Hotel Changi by Far East which I like much better (it is also much better located)."
Took time to check in our company and we were offered no help with the luggage. They scan every passport and take the high deposit fee. Felt like a maze to walk in corridors and several houses and elevators. The breakfast was good. Our rooms did not feel good. The hotel is located a little offside about 15 kilometers from the airport.
"It's really a nice hotel, quiet, big, relaxing and has lot of trees for a Singaporean hotel. Pity the air-conditioning  in our room not working although the technician repaired as said, all is ok. We couldn't sleep properly. Restaurant is nice too. Must try is the Pizza with Rendang, very unusual, but very good. Buffet is nice too. Lot of good selection. If air-conditioning was ok, 4 stars. But we would stay here again next time we visit Singapore, although far from the centre."
"Peaceful and tranqil surroundings in a modern Hotel,Changi Cove is ideal for the whole family.Set in a lush area of Changi this Hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of the commercial centre of Singapore. However it is within walking distance of the Historic Changi village where traditional shopping is available. The walk from the hotel can be done along the shoreline boardwalk which is extremely pleasurable and interesting.The Hotel is extremely clean and housekeeping is done daily in each room.The staff are attentive and all are eager to assist with your every need.Of particular note are Abby(now on maternity leave)  has been of great assistance,Rahim,who has been specially selected for his front office expertise and friendlyness,and Kevin (in food and bevorage section) who"
"The hotel is in a lovely location, beautifully quiet with rainforest trees all around. A quick and inexpensive taxi ride to the airport. We actually chose to base our five day Singapore stay here and found it an ideal location, the local are I'd stunning, the boardwalk down to the village where there re many dining options. We used the swimming pool several times which is great, huge, mostly deserted and about a three minute walk. The hotel itself was quite echoey, the people nice us had a creaky laminate floor and kept different hours to us, so we were woken up often by them only walking around, and doors open and closing echoes down the corridors.  The rooms were clean and of a reasonable size, let down by no fridge which in this environment made it difficult. The breakfast"
"Although we had some idea of the general facilities before booking, Changi Cove was a real surprise.  After several visits staying in CBD and inner CBD hotels we were delighted to find the peace and quiet, and relaxed rain forest and coastal surrounds. Our very late arrival due to a much delayed flight was no cause for concern and the check-in in the ""wee small hours"" was made as comfortable for us as possible and the night staff were very sympathetic and helpful. The room was comfortable, and the shower was refreshingly roomy (no elbows at sides, or bending to get beneath the nozzle).  Breakfast was well-presented, varied and more than satisfying.    The complimentary leaflets on attractions around Changi, and birds likely to be seen in the hotel grounds were a nice touch, and"
"2nd stay here and the hotel is just what you need if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the concrete jungle of S'pore.  Not much around the hotel, except how I remember S'pore used to be like.  Guests can use Changi beach club pool or gym, airport is less than 15 mins by car. Shout out for Khairi at the front check in desk, he is an exemplary employee as are all of the staff that work there.  Also kudos to the reception service man who is a mainstay at the front door, his service is beyond outstanding, always greets with a huge smile!!!"
"Thank you indeed to the wonderful Leonard who was my hero today in Singapore. He went out of my way to ensure I was safe, well looked after with a lovely room and at short notice. Thank you Changi Cove I love your resort and staff teams.  We will be back. ‚úÖ"
"Plus points: The hotel had nice trees around.  It‚Äôs quite close to the airport if one wants to get a quick night of sleep.  Food was ok. We were served by Kevin who was a fantastic waiter!  Less positive aspects: - No balcony! - It‚Äôs a non smoking hotel & smoking area is very far from the guest rooms. - Swing in a very small room. We didn‚Äôt really understand why. - Very small beds. - Located close to Changi village - nothing to visit, some canteen type restaurants only"
"We stayed in Changi Cove for one night at the end of June 2019. We had just landed in Singapore from Dublin and had a flight to Phomn Penh, Cambodia the next day. This was a very relaxed place to stay to fight the jet lag. The hotel is just a short taxi ride from Changi Airport so very convenient for an overnighter. We were warmly received and shown to a very comfortable room with a good shower room. The entire place was quiet and conducive to sleeping. Another bonus was the free access to the Changi Beach Club for a swim just a few metres down the road. The Board Walk around the Cove was a pleasant place to walk. Our room had tea/coffee facilities and there was a residents‚Äô lounge beside our room where more complimentary tea/coffee and biscuits were available. We had a very"
Hotel is ok in a very quiet place. However I feel is mainly there because of the conference centre. A shuttle bus along with other small things would make it a much easier choice for an overnight stay. Breakfast is good. Staff also nice.
I stayed st this hotel with my cousin for an overnight stay. We arrived late and left pretty early. The stay was nice. However the hotel staff didn‚Äôt really greet us or help us in when we arrived. The rooms are past their conference centre so it is a little bit of a hike. During the day the large tree on the way to your room is really lovely and I‚Äôd imagine it would be relaxing sitting by there. Brekky is cute - you can ask for an omelette to be made otherwise it is a Continental brekkie with a few Asian dishes.
"This is my second time staying at Changi Cove. Loved this hotel's surroundings, full of greeneries, wonderfully relaxing and therapeutic. The  minimalist decor of the room is also most pleasing to the eye. Special mention to the shampoo and body shower gel, enjoyed it's unique fragrance that I couldn't find at other hotels. The staff were mostly friendly and smiley :) would love to come back again!!"
"With the beach and the Changi board walk just round the corner, Changi Cove is what I would describe as a good venue for small conferences.  Room are nice and neat and ample size. Bathroom was well appointed. What was surprising was that in this hot tropical climate, the room did not have a fridge to chill the drinks purchased from outside.  What was also lacking, which I find surprising for a hotel this size is a pool and a gym. Granted that the beach and board walk is round the corner but not everyone wants to go to the beach and the weather may not be favourable for a walk along the board walk.  Food options are quite limited in the immediate vicinity but Changi Village is a 20 min walk away.  Question is would I come back here for a staycation? The answer is probably not."
"No room service at all. No refrigerator/mini fridge in room.Restaurant closed by 11 PM so no food available after that. TV having problems but no technician available, so no solution. Far location. So choose wisely."
"Came here for a weekend staycation and I am pleased with the room. I saw many complains about it being too small but at the price, I was happy with the size. It was clean and cosy as well. It also came with a really hearty buffet breakfast. You don‚Äôt have any cheap food close by but the nearest is at Changi Village, about a 3 minutes cab ride away. Overall, a great stay and totally recommended if they continue to maintain the place well."
My wife recently spent one night here on our way back to Australia. It is a $10 SGD Grab taxi ride from the airport. Check in staff were fabulous and we were escorted to our room which was lucky cos it was a bit of a hike. Room was small but perfect for our overnight use. It is probably not in an area where you would spend 3-4 days but it suited our needs. The guy at the front desk was very helpful with suggestions for our dinner and getting GRab taxis for pickup. Unfortunately the nearby hawker centre was closed for cleaning but there were restaurants nearby that were fine but not cheap. Breakfast next morning was great with plenty of options. Would stay again if in transit.
"We were gifted with a 3 days 2 nights stay here over the Christmas break and I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the stay!  Location wise it is very near Changi Village and matter of fact can take the boardwalk all the way there!  It is very quiet and it was a much needed break as there was no shopping malls, no 'bulk' tourists and even the housekeeping crew were quiet!  A few rooms were designed and catered for older folks such as putting bars in the toilets and safe amenities for usage.  Our room has a Nespresso machine which was absolutely wonderful to start the morning with or an afternoon perk up!  Though there were no scenery per se, there are lots of nature such as a beautiful tall olive tree that is over 200 years old!  There is also a children's playground and 3 big"
"Near the airport this hotel offers accommodation in peaceful surroundings. The property is set in beautiful tropical gardens. The staff exhibit a high level of customer relations and service and are reflective of a much higher hotel rating. Breakfast is excellent and very reasonable. Although away from Changi Village , this is an easy ride on the bus for a few stops. Busses come every 10 minutes and stops at Changi bus terminal. Make sure you have change. Fare is $3 Singapore."
"Stayed here for a Day use  after disembarking in the morning. Our flight did not leave until 7 pm.  This was a nice option for us to stay from 9 am to 3 pm for $84 SGD/$60 USD. We paid an extra $10SGD for Late checkout to stay until 4 pm.  The staff was lovely and friendly.  This is mainly a conference hotel.  The guest rooms are a bit of a walk from the lobby but there is good signage to point you in the right direction.  In addition, the front desk staff offered to walk us to our room.  It is about a 25 minute walk to Changi Village where you can grab a bite to eat.  There are onsite options as well.  Would definitely recommend and use again."
"The Changi Cove represents a truly different experience in Singapore where I have visited many many times. THe serenity of the coast, a great staff, an accommodating restaurant, proximity to Changi Cove Village provides an opportunity to experience SPore in a different manner.   The rooms are basic but comfortable and very clean.  Basically, Changi Cove is a conference hotel with 112 rooms, and, of course, available to the public.  Changi Cove stays include usage of a great Sports Complex, and a walk along the 2.2 km boardwalk  is alluring and restful...I even spotted a white collared Kingfisher. It must be lovely to be so stunning!!!.. The hotel is much farther than 2 miles from the airport, but was a 12 S Dollar Grab ride...albeit at 4 in the morning.  A very very nice place"
Changi Cove is near the airport and good for a stopover .Rooms are clean and a good size but the single bed are on the very small size not the size you get in western countries your feet tends to hang over. I am an average size person Further more everything is good .Staff very friendly Breakfast is good nice variety.Nothing much to do around there if you want a good restaurant you have to take a bus or cab to changi village not far away .You can also take a walk on the broadwalk all along the beach will take about 20 minutes.At changi village you can take a ferry to JB or across to the island. No pool on this property so you can use the sport club pool.Nice place to chill out .Good value for money.
"I booked this hotel at the last minute and was so pleasantly surprised by how attentive the staff was, generous the free breakfast (with both western and Asian options), comfortable - altho small - the room was, and how restful the guest lounge was for the hours after check out and before leaving for the airport. There is also a lovely coastal walk and a nearby bus to Changi village and to Tampine (a planned community with lots of food and shopping options). All of this at AU$200 for a king room -- considerable less than most others and only an $18 cab ride from the airport (inc. tip)."
"We need a place to stay for 1 night and found this place to meet the requirement. Actually better than expected. It's within an easy cab ride from the airport. This is a resort, meeting center cum hotel facility. The rooms were clean and good size. We especially enjoyed the breakfast, first class fare with both international and local favorites. I would recommend adding this to the room."
The rooms were clean and comfortable. There is a good selection of food at the breakfast buffet. The location was good for us as we only had an overnight stay before flying the following day. Good value for money. The staff were slightly  unhelpful but they appeared to be mainly traineees. There are some nearby restaurants so you can get out and about.
"Nice location for a few days stop between flights. Very helpful personnel. Taxi was SGD18 fused price going there from the airport using the tourist information at the airport. Return was SGD 9.50 just catching a random taxi at 06.00 am. Should be easy with a bus though as per GoogleMaps, which we did not try but would be in the SGD3 range.  We went to Pulau Ubin for a half day. Nice experience if you want to see a different side of Singapore"
"Stayed in this hotel for a couple of days. The room is pretty small but clean and comfortable. Just needed a room to freshen up and rest. Breakfast in the hotel is good enough. The waiter and waitress in the restaurant will never smile at you except for Joey. They will give you a unhappy face whenever you request something from them. There‚Äôs a swimming pool and gym just across the street about 2-3 mins walk. Special mention to Ms Alisya and Ms Lily for making our stay wonderful. A quick check in and out and brought us to the room. Whenever you see both of them, they will smile and greet you. Kudos to them! Manager Guani was there to help us with the luggage and get us a taxi. Will come back whenever we are here for a short trip."
"We decided to stay at the hotel because we were attending a wedding at the ballroom. The hotel is clean and in a quiet side of Singapore, convenient for someone looking for a short stay near the airport. It's far from the city and if you are planning to do tourism, what you will save on the hotel fare you will spend in taxi fares. Breakfast is good, with an egg station, pastries, cold cuts, fruits, yogurt, juices and some Asian dishes. The rooms are not huge but comfortable, with Nespresso machine and kettle. The shower is modern and water pressure is top. There's not much nearby and the restaurant has a limited menu. There is no room service. Guests can use the swimming pool of the club down the road (3 minutes walk)."
"Changi Cove Hotel is very conveniently placed for the airport, just a short taxi ride. A S$50 deposit was requested from my card. I forgot to request it when checking out and the receptionist didn‚Äôt offer to return it. Consequently it took 4 weeks for it to return to my account. The room was very comfortable and clean. The restaurant was efficient and the food was good. If you stay here be sure to walk the short distance down to the Boardwalk."
We stayed here for a short stopover and enjoyed the access to the Beach Club pool and boardwalk. The fantastic Changi Village Hawker Centre is 20 mins pleasant walk or a short bus ride. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Agree with previous reviewer about extortionate price of beer!
"Stayed 3 nights at this hotel to break journey back from Australia to London.  It is near to the airport so convenient after a long flight.  You can take public transport (cheap and efficient) into the city for sightseeing.  The hotel rooms are more like student accommodation, with even a whiteboard wall for you to doodle on, but clean and comfortable.  The staff and very friendly and helpful.  The only gripes I would have are that a) there was no fridge in the room and b) the price of a drink at their bar/restaurant is excessive e.g. $14+ for a Tiger beer!"
"I'm totally impressed by this quaint hotel! I did stayed here before when it first opened. A short staycay with hubby. At that time, quite a few facilities like restaurant which is now White Olive, was not functioning yet. This time round, i was at changi vincinity with my family walking the boardwalk the exploring around. One of my kids needed to use the washroom thus we decided to drop by this hotel to take a look and see what has changed. Apparently, it is a change for the better!   We went to the washrooms and as my kids were quite tired from the walking, we decided to rest at the lobby for a while on the comfy couches. My daughter was thirsty and wanted to buy a bottle of water to drink. She approached a staff at the cafe and asked for a bottle of water. We gave her money"
"It‚Äôs a nice hotel, immersed in beautiful tropical vegetation, service is vero good and food is good. It‚Äô AroundMe 40 mini taxi from downrown. But the re are nice walk to go to Changi beach that‚Äôs is vero near."
"Location Far east side of Singapore. There are a lot of greenery in this area and walkable to the Coastal Area.     Room You need to walk a bit just to get to the rooms, the rooms are nice and functional.  It is good to just rest inside.  There is a bean bag small sofa for you to rest.   Facilities The hotel does not have a pool in house, but you can walk to Changi Beach Club to use their Pool( 50M lap) and sporting facilities.  It is not bad but just have to walk. Breakfast The breakfast was good and I enjoyed myself eating the buffet  Staff  Friendly and helpful , special thanks to Mr Fahmi who checked us in.  Very polite and helpful."
"It is in the middle of nowhere. The rooms is like a labyrinth changing from building to building boing up and down stairs to reach your room. Just one restaurant which serves from 7am till 21:30, after that, even if you need one soft drink you have to take a taxi."
"I just stayed at the Changi Cove Hotel.  It's an inexpensive hotel but the rooms are very clean.  I'm a very picky person when it comes to a clean hotel rooms and this met my standards.  The twin beds are a bit short if you are over 6' (182 cm) tall.  If you are, just ask them for a queen size or king sized bed.  The bathroom was very clean and the view from my room was nice and relaxing.  The bed was made every day as well as fresh towels too.  there is a beautiful tree on the grounds that is apparently about 150 years old.  It's huge ! Although I didn't get a chance to visit the boardwalk, I heard it was only about a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  Oh their facilities are fantastic too if you happen to go there for a wedding or a conference.  Their conference theater room had a"
"I stayed here for one night between a flight in and a ferry out of Singapore. The location is beautiful and quiet (not the same as being in the big city hotels in town) with lots of old trees, birds  and greenery. It is very close to the changi walkway which runs alongside the beach and you can walk all the way along to changi village and back. A bus runs nearby that connects to the MRT station, but it is a bit of a long trip (with some MRT changes) if you want to go into Central. (Same to get to and from the airport if you want to use public transport for that).  The room was clean and quirky (you can write on the wall with whiteboard marker, there's a hanging chair, and a nespresso machine), and the breakfast was good at the restaurant. The rooms are a little way away from"
"I stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed the peaceful surroundings and the Changi boardwalk. The pool at the beach club is excellent. The hotel is very clean and has really good green spaces, the staff were very friendly and helpful and also the restaurant staff were really helpful.   A different type of Singapore stay compared to my usual but very enjoyable and will do it again."
"We stayed at Changi Cove in room 402 for 5 nights from 1-6 September.  As pleasant as the view was I must admit I was a bit disappointed about the dull room due to there being just a small window.  But, I‚Äôd just come from Village hotel, Changi, & I had a room with a sea view almost the length of my wall, & nothing, was going to beat that.  Although the hotel very kindly offered me another room, which I declined. Also I was told to go back next morning to see if there was anything more suitable, but I didn‚Äôt bother.  The offer was however much appreciated all the same.    Once I‚Äôd got over the shock of no sea view room (I‚Äôm sure someone on TA claimed to have one, liar, liar, pants on fire), I settled down quite nicely.  The rooms looked fairly new-ish & were comfortable,"
"I have travelled as a business consultant for many years and mostly stay in top hotels.  I had to speak at an event at this hotel and moved here after staying at the Swissotel downtown. I have never encountered as friendly and dedicated service as I have at this hotel, up to and including the night receptionist giving me a bag of snacks before I left for the airport in the middle of the night. A Ritz Carlton manager would be jealous of the employees in this hotel."
"Changi Cove is a Resort hotel with very clean rooms and welcoming staff. Our coordinator, Serene is very accommodating to most of our requests and needs. Her colleagues are approachable and ready to serve our needs. If you are looking for a quite place to stay far from the noise and hassle of the city, Changi Cove is the right place!"
"~our company had a kickoff event at Changi Cove for about 150pax and it was perfect!  ~the curtains behind the stage opens into lush green jungle!  ~the foyer had enough seating for dining tables totally separated from the auditorium and food was adequately served for a good quality meal for all diets  ~there was enough space to run gaming stations and more than enough spots on the grounds for a treasure hunt  ~while we didn't use their lodging facilities or sonsite deli & restuarant their remote location is a okus for them  ~the downside is onsite parking is very limited, so Grab/Uber/Taxi is prolly a good choice"
The check-in staff (man) who served me should not be put in this department at all because he is not courteous nor friendly nor enthusiastic in his work. Funnily he asked me if it is my first time staying at this hotel. I replied yes. He stopped at that. I thought he was going to explain to me things in the hotel like shared swimming pool and other facilities with Changi Beach Club nearby. But no he didn't.  I only knew about this from other people's reviews. What a let down. Later when I arrived at my room I was surprised that there were twin beds. As I was going to stay alone I requested a double bed at the time of booking. I rang the reception to request a change to a double bed and was shocked to hear that I had to pay $20 extra. What kind of hotel is this? All hotels let
"We chose this property because it was close to airport. Basically, thats the only thing appeared to be justified. The rest is simply aweful. This super modern hotel cant really check in you in a prompt area. Be ready to deal with slow guy at the front desk for like half an hour waiting till he trying to find a right button on the keyboard. The room was prepaid, all details had been entered in advance, staff was informed in advance, but no. You just need to wait a little bit. For a while. in 5am in the morning after night flight.  As many guests reported already, the building is like a maze. Go left, take elevator,  go right, take left, oh there are gates everywhere. another elevator. Luckily, I was a good Doom player, but it would be much easier if there was a porter. Didn't I"
The staff at changi cove were amazing. They were very helpful and made us feel really welcome. The hotel is tucked away in a corner of Singapore so you can be sure to enjoy the peace and tranquillity a time the hotel away from the hustle and bustle of Singapore city life.
The price was reasonable. I paid about $150 per night. It is a basically a business hotel that has alot of meeting rooms. The room has basic amenities and is very clean. It has a doodle wall for me to write my thoughts on it. It is a short distance from changi board walk. Lovely.
"We chose Changi Cove as a very brief stopover because it was cheaper than airport hotels, was only 12 min away and we thought it would be quiet. All of this was true. We slept well and emerged refreshed and ready for the next long flight. The front desk staff member was wonderful in getting us checked in ASAP to maximise our sleep time."
Changi Cove is set in beautiful green grounds with fabulously old trees. The hotel winds its way up the hillside and provides such tranquility. Check-in is fast and efficient and they will store luggage if you arrive before time. There is a very good cafe in reception(where breakfast is also taken). Security is present throughout the hotel with additional gates to swipe and tap and that might bother some people. Rooms are small but have everything you need. Taxis to airport are around $S15 while those to it are $10 more. Take a taxi to the city for about $25. I would certainly come here again.
"I just had a one night stay last weekend after attending my best friend's wedding held at Changi Cove's auditorium. I only booked a standard room and we were really pleased with the room. It was really clean, spacious and quiet. The toilet is well maintained and rather spotless. The staffs are all super polite, young, and courteous. The wedding itself went really well and we all love the venue. It has a really high ceiling and it makes the whole place so much more dreamy.   Changi Cove is tucked away at the end of Singapore and it's in a very quiet area, which we enjoyed.   Breakfast spread was small but tasted good. Vert sufficient for a light breakfast.   All in all, we had a great stay."
"We had originally booked a different hotel which was so bad we were desperate to find something and booked this ten minutes prior to our arrival. The reception team weren't flustered by this at all and were very accommodating so late at night.  The price was great for singapore and only a short taxi ride from and to the airport. We hadn't had dinner and dined in their restaurant which was great food and variety and the staff were great. The rooms are small but adequate and clean, they are a little tricky to find on your first journey to them, but the staff are very helpful and once you get your bearings its fine. For an overnight stay before a very early flight we were very happy with this hotel and would definitely stay again if transitting through. There aren't any shops or"
"Is it possible to find hotel accommodation and get away from it all ‚Äì in Singapore? Surely not, I hear you say. Well if that‚Äôs what you desire then there is such a hotel on the small city island, it‚Äôs called Changi Cove and is an absolute gem. To begin with Changi Cove is not too far from Changi Airport (by taxi around 15-20 minutes) and a 15 minute walk to the pleasant Changi Village with its assortment of restaurants and hawker centres (inexpensive eating food courts) and relaxed atmosphere. The hotel is nestled in lush gardens on quiet Cranwell Road, which mainly plays home to Singapore civil service ‚Äúholiday‚Äù and military accommodation, which all seem to have their own spacious grounds.  You wouldn‚Äôt know Changi Cove was there until you sweep around into the hotel‚Äôs"
The room has plenty of space and is clean. Close to Singapore city but far enough away you can enjoy a quiet beach or run on the boardwalk in the morning. Glad I stayed here and not inside the city...
"We decided to stay near the airport for two nights and chose Changi Cove hotel.  Staff were good, hotel nice but a little out of the way.  Think would be better in the actual Changi area.  The boardwalk was fantastic really worth doing and only minutes from the hotel.  Found a good restaurant not far from the hotel  The Coastal Settlement, where we went for dinner was excellent."
"Location is pretty close (2mins walk) to Changi Coastal Broadwalk. It leads you to changi village where they are lots of Hawker food and cafes. If you dont want to walk, then this is bus 29 outside the hotel (3 to 4 mins walk to bus stop) and it gets you to changi village too. Moreover, we spotted otters on our way back from a full dinner. Nice walk and scenary! The room was clean, spacious and you are allowed to draw on the doodle wall. The bean bag and the bed (deluxe king) was comfortable! Breakfast was simple & good. Staff were friendly too. We requested for an hour late check out and the staff accomodate to our request.  Overall, it was an pleasant 2 days 1 night stay. Recommended for a short stay. You may get bored as the location isn't near town area n there are no"
"Changi Cove is a fabulous hotel for business conference, pleasure and family. Here is my experience:  Check in & out: 10mins  ( 8/10) Hospitality: Very good (8/10) refreshing iced water and biscuits available.   Room  Room: high standard of cleanliness (9/10) Ambience: Amazing! Our room had a swing which you can literally fall asleep in. We had a great view of garden from our window.

"A beautiful hotel, location and helpful friendly service. We loved this hotel and location that we cut our trip short in Bali to return to Changi Cove. At the front desk Mr. Rahim Satar greeted us each morning with a map outlining how to navigate the subway to get to our desired destination, he also made sure we had water for our trip. What a joy to be greeted each morning by Rahim. Our room was great, clean and with a Nespresso machine. Breakfast was FANTASTIC! We loved walking in the area along the ocean boardwalk towards Changi Village for some amazing food. Overall 5 Star experience."
"Didn't know what to expect when we booked this place but the front desk staff are very friendly and helpful (Muhammad KHAIRI, Duty Mgr.  Whoever was onboard, they helped us book Grab everyday.   Small things matter like water and some sweets at the lobby, and the write, doodle, draw wall was a novelty."
"Front desk staff members were friendly, check in & check out done smoothly.   The complimentary local coconut biscuits near the front desk were delicious!   Room was quite, spacious & clean. Ample towels provided. No cotton buds provided though.   The single twin bed were narrow, was expecting the usual king size single bed.   Duvet was too thick, woke up a few times feeling too hot despite aircon set at 20C. Regretted not asking for extra bed sheet to replace the duvet.   Breakfast was ok, but the morning shift staff members at the White Olive could really learn about custom service from their evening shift colleagues. No smile & when asked for something they just handed you the items without saying anything, even when I thanked them they just looked at me then looked away."
"Went here for a 5-day seminar and I must say this place is wonderful! The amenities are excellent and the food is simply superb. Everyday breakfast is a delight. Even lunch and dinner are wonderful and diverse. The staff are dear people, very hardworking. It‚Äôs near the airport so you can even watch the endless stream of airplanes without the noise, they almost look like a fireworks display. There are many birds also. We saw more than 6 eagles (walk to the boardwalk, a 5min way away from Changi Cove) and 4 hornbills (one flew right past me. It was awesome!)  The place is a safe haven away from the city, packed with amenities so you‚Äôre enjoying the best of both worlds."
"This was our second visit back to Changi Cove after having stayed there just a year ago. We had loved it so much the first time and this second visit was just as lovely. The hotel is still a wonderful, quiet getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life and it is just a 25 minute walk to Changi Village where a variety of great food awaits. It's a great place to take a break and take in the quiet sounds of nature. I would consider going back again except for the rather unfriendly front desk service we received on arrival and on checking out. There were no smiles, no words of welcome and no words of thank you. This was inexplicable for an establishment where the rest of the staff, particularly the staff we met at breakfast, were professional and friendly."
"Tucked in the far corner of Singapore with really nothing much to distract one,  Hanoi Cove is a great place for a retreat to rest and just chill and enjoy the sea and nature.  The rooms are well equipped especially love the nespresso machine and the scribble wall. It is the place to go for a retreat and do nothing. The breakfast is a good spread with egg and noodle station and good croissants.  There is a guest lounge that‚Äôs great for quiet afternoon. Lots of space to find a quiet corner to read and rest. And there‚Äôs a heritage Jelutong tree in the garden that‚Äôs is treasured. All in all, a great place for a retreat."
"We checked in on 13 March 2018 for 4 nights with total 5 rooms. We had a very comfortable and memorable stay in this hotel. Location is suitable as we attend Kingdom Invasion Conference in the Singapore Expo, you can walk to the close by Changi Village for wonderful hawker food. Grab service is easy to get at this area too.  What I love the most is the staffs in the hotel, they are so friendly, so helpful, especially to Mr Rahim and Mr Khairul from the front desk. Seems like we have known them for years, they are just an awesome ppl.  The room has what you need, love the Nespresso coffee machine,the lemongrass shower gel and Comfy bed.  They had a beautiful ballroom which we have the opportunity to witness 3 wedding dinner during the week. love the function room set up too.. it"
We had a one night staycation and we enjoyed it. Breakfast was not of variety but they had what we required and filled our stomach. Place away from the city life... Beatiful and we truly enjoyed it.  No swimming pool. But five mins walk to chngi beach club was a plus
"Had an awesome and refreshing 4 days stay at Changi Cove. Surrounded by nature, a peaceful ambience and comfortable bed, I think its a good place for corporate retreats, family staycation and personal get away. Its a tuck away gem in Singapore, far from the maddening crowd but not so far from civilization that you can still get to amenities at the Changi village if you need to. Only 5 min to the coastal broadwalk.   Wish I could stay longer but glad to have this opportunity for this get away admist the hustle and bustle of everyday work.  Pearl"
"We literally just stayed the one night while getting another flight, this hotel surprised me so much. Was my boyfriend's birthday, they had wrote on the wall for him as there's a white board wall, we went for dinner, come back and there was a brownie for him with a candle. On check in they were so friendly and helpful, rooms were a good size, bathroom was good too with a really powerful shower. Had all the amenities you could want like tea and coffee, toothpaste, toothbrush shower gel. On check in the staff were so friendly and helpful and again on check out. We had a really quick breakfast in the morning but was pleasantly surprised, again staff were friendly, there was plenty of food available with a wide range. Taxi from airport takes 10 mins, was about 12 Singapore dollars"
