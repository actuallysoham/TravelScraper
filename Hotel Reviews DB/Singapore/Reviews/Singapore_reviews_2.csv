"We had a 1-night staycation at Fullerton’s Heritage Room for my birthday celebration.  Upon reaching, the check-in process was smooth and fuss-free with staff readily available on hand to attend to any requests. Mr Justin Phua, who facilitated our check-in, offered a complimentary Fullerton Bear as a birthday gift and also assisted us with our request on late check-out which was amazing! We had much more time to enjoy the beautiful room and facilities like the swimming pool.   Mr Andrew also assisted us on our special request on the room, much to our delight! The in-house catering team, including Ms Ling, who attended to us, was amazing and attentive to our orders. The warmth and hospitality that Fullerton radiates is something special for all guests who wish to consider a stay"
"So, I've looked up the reviews before choosing to go with Fullerton this time for a friend's birthday celebration. However, I was disappointed and would not return again. Here's why: 1. Prearrival - received email 5 days in advance to fill out a form. Filled out the form and responded to the email to inquire hi-tea and cocktail timing as I will be celebrating my friend's birthday and need to do some planning. Was forwarded to the straits club mgr to answer the hi-tea and cocktail timing, only.  2. Arrival - ID with date of birth was given upon check in but also no recognition.  3. Room is old, facing the insides of the hotel with minimum amenities. Understand it's COVID and you trying to go green but not sure if that is luxury - when you need the guest to call and request for"
Staycation time. Excellent checkin/front desk staff. Great room with Marina Bay view. Bed and sheets great to sleep and recharge. Toilet is TOTO with bidet! Great shower/bath facility.   Cable TV is choppy and needs to be improved on.  Really enjoyed my stay! 😊
Had a stay in Fullerton hotel. The staff is kind to offer my wife a cake as they get to know her birthday during our registration. The view from the swimming pool is specular with the colonial style building as the backdrop and the view of the Singapore River.
"We held our wedding at Fullerton and were blown away by the stellar service of Benedict Anthony Salvaraj (aka Ben) and his team. We could not have asked for a more perfect banquet manager. He was proactive, accommodating, polite and never failed to anticipate our every need. For example, when the bride made a passing comment about her hands being dirty, he immediately whipped out hand sanitiser within seconds to assist. Ben led his team effectively and was able to ensure that everything was executed according to plan even though we made multiple last minute changes.   Not only did Ben perform his role exceptionally, he was also a very reassuring and calming presence during the whole event and especially before our march-ins. He truly went above and beyond and is really an asset"
"The Fullerton Hotel and its rich architecture , history and heritage made our weekend staycation very special and pampered , where we was cosseted in luxury and hospitality, at every turn and corner ; be it in the hotel rooms , the dining areas and the external surroundings; in its classy ambience and stellar service.   Most notable is the hotel’s very well trained, professional service staff ( from front desk , reception , Town restaurant , chambermaids ) who also exuded sincere willingness to help and answer our every requests ; tactfully offering helpful suggestions whenever we were at a loss or appeared confounded at our choices , confused at directions or even mode of ordering in the restaurants.  Most commendable : Mr Lalikumar ( v accommodating and with a charming sense"
"What an amazing experience.   We stayed just one night, a midweek escape. The room was well appointed, and the hotel not overly busy, due to COVID restrictions.  The staff are beyond incredible. This is one of the key things that sets this hotel apart from others.   Special call out to Abigael in the town restaurant, who made our breakfast so enjoyable.   While we have been to the Lighthouse Bar, many times, this was our first time staying at the hotel.   It was a very memorable experience. We will be back for another stay soon."
"This was our family's 1st  at Fullerton. Everything was Perfect. Thank you to Ray and Colleague for the yummy cakes for my nephews' birthday. Special shout out to Claudia from reception for being such a darling. She rendered kind assistance when required, made arrangements and provided clear explainations to us. Thank you for ""the little view of the bay"" Claudia. We loved the room! Room was in tip top condition. The tub super huge. Rain shower was godsend. The ""warm"" toilet a pleasure. Love the scent of the bath amenities! Cable channels were great. Our favourite was of cos the pool. The view was amazing!  In short, it was a Great weekend staycay. Thank you!"
"Hubby and I met in the Fullerton Hotel many years ago. We decided to spend our wedding anniversary back to where we first met. We both knew the hotel quite well and we have visited this historic building numerous times. This place hold special meaning in our hearts.   This will be our first staycation since the pandemic. As we are all at the mercy of the virus, the hotel lobby look a little different. Sofas and lobby chairs were sparsely located adhering to the safe distancing measures. Shields were put up at the concierge and reception counters.   We were checked in by Nicholas at the reception. He explained very clearly and politely that we would need to book for breakfast slot, gym and pool times.  We were pleasantly greeted by Roszel who Congratulate us on our wedding"
I booked a one-night staycation (12/04/21 to 13/04/21) for my mother but was unable to join her due to work commitment. I was initially worried if she would be able to manage on her own.  I soon realised that my worry was uncalled for as I listened to how your staff took such good care of her during her check-in and check-out process. We did not manage to get the name of your staff but please help me relay my sincerest thanks to your front desk officer for making my mother feel so welcome. Her daily work routine actually made our day tremendously. I am more than happy to provide my booking information so that the establishment can identify said officer so please DM me.
My family and I had a fantastic stay at your hotel. We booked 5 rooms as it was my wedding in a nearby venue. The service provided was remarkable. All the people working in Fullerton have a great sense of customer service instilled in them. I have to give a special mention to a stellar gentleman. His name is Prabu and he was at the concierge. Since the time we checked-in till our stay ended he took great care of all of us. Always with a bright smile on his face he assisted us in the best way he could. He showed us the best locations in the hotel to take our wedding photographs as well! From then on I have told all my family members or friends who book the Fullerton hotel to look for him for assistance. All of them have gotten back to me saying that he has taken care of them very
Came for a staycation for the 3rd time with Fullerton as we had our wedding 5 years ago here. Service is still so impeccable! Had a great high tea at courtyard and was causally speaking to Mr Lilakumar that we had our wedding here n he promptly went to ask the rooms team for a room upgrade for us. We are so touched with the extra mile to make our stay an even more memorable one in this hotel that holds so much dear memories for both my husband and I. No doubt still the best hotel in our view. Thanks to the Fullerton team for giving us a very warm n sincere service! It feels like home 😊
"Last time we visited Fullerton in Feb 2020 and we were impressed by the quality of services and particular staff.  This time, in April 2021, we stay in a Palladian Suite for a 2 days staycation and we had a negative experience overall: 1. The Fullerton is the only hotel which didn't send a pre-arrival email to book slots for pool, breakfast, checkin, restaurants, etc.  2. Checkin was a mess, we needed to wait about 30-40 minutes, everything was very slow.  3. The checkin staff insisted that we can book slots for pool, gym, etc by calling them from room, he didn't really want to assist and he tried to expedite. No info about nothing, restaurants, spa, etc. It was fun that he told us that he will upgrade to a palladian suite, which was actually the suite that we paid for. 4. The"
"My family decided to have a one-night staycation at the Fullerton hotel in April. Booked one night shortly after spending two nights at MBS. This package was recommended to us by AMEX Platinum travel service which includes a high-tea, evening cocktails and Chandon breakfast.  Initial check-in impression and the room are all fine, no major issues. The real issue with us is around the high-tea and evening cocktail. The key issue and source of our disappointment is around the clarity of the service level/offering and the attitude of one particular service staff. During the high-tea, the aforesaid staff told us that this is not a buffet-style high-tea but they can allow us to ask for more sandwiches and scones. No further top-ups for the macaroons and cakes. Got the second serving"
"A big shout out for the service rendered by the staff at Fullerton Hotel. Did a staycay with the family and we loved it. Kudos to the team who made our stay fantastic.. In particular, Justin Phua, Duty manager on duty when we were there. Thank you so much for making it a memorable stay.. Kids are bugging us for another stay as soon as possible..."
"Thanks  to Paulo, we thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Straits Club! He walks the extra mile and knows his stuff & product knowledge.  Only back the second time in a day, we already feel so welcomed and at home."
First and foremost I would like to compliment Claudia at the front desk for being so supporting & helping me out in surprising my husband for our anniversary. Thank you so much!   Other than that we are satisfied. The service is excellence. The room is clean. The view from our room is beautiful. We cn see the Marina Bay view.  Thumbs up! We will be coming back for more staycation.
"Another staycation in Singapore. This time we chose the Fullerton for a 2-night family stay. We had a great time by the pool thanks to Sall, the outstanding pool attendant who makes sure you have all you need to relax. This may be not the largest pool in Singapore but, overlooking the Singapore river, with Sall taking care of you, we did have a wonderful time."
"Thank you Aldin, Kenneth & Nic for the warm hospitality. Aldin was very attentive and prompt despite us being the last customer for the night when the club was almost closing. She declined to accept our tip. Thus the least we can do is leave them a comment here for a wonderful service."
"We spent our Easter weekend, and as expected, our stay was nothing short of wonderful.  The hotel's elegance is reflected by the grandeur of its architecture, impressive room and bathroom's finishes, and the warm and welcoming hotel staff.  We would like to thank the hotel staff for their great service, and to Ms. Kate from reception and Mr. Paolo from The Straits Club for being accommodating to us during our stay."
"Check-in queue control was excellent,  my boy was given crayons and color book,  and a Fullerton bear as part of the package.  Afternoon tea and cocktail sessions were ok, not the semi buffet style but tea set. most of the staff members there were friendly . food was not as good as we expected from a 5 stars hotel.  We didn't like the room as there was a big pillar blocking 90% of view.. Curtains were a bit dusty,  could see the dusts flying in air under the ceiling lights.. Shower was not hot enough for our liking.  Pool was ok but not big,  still worth a visit to see the nice view."
"Thank you Fullerton team for taking care of us. Rafi guided us to wait for check in. It was surprisingly busy but their Q management was superb.   Mira is so sweet. Assisted my partner and I swiftly for check in. She is very detailed and went through our benefits thoroughly.   Our room came with club benefits hence after check in - we proceeded to the club lounge, served by Norish who is polite and graceful. Unfazed by the crowd, the club team did such a good job ensuring that all their guests were taken care off.   My partner and I were also very amazed by Mr Roszel. Firstly we met him at the lobby assisting check in. The next time we saw him at the lounge during evening cocktail, serving guests, making the effort to know all his guests and even took the time to speak to us. We"
Every accommodation is made up by a team of people to make the place special !!  This place has such a great view and facilities to offer however it wasn’t that which makes me leave the hotel at the end of the stay feeling heavy hearted !! It was the staff !! There are so many small detailing that I have observed that every each one of the staff in this hotel would make sure they do their very best to make sure you feel like home . One of my best favorite was uncle Toh Heng who most of the time under the hot sun making sure everyone gotten their towels and water by the pool yet so smiley :) !! What is unbelievable consistently that I would like the world to know about is our care taker Miss Olivia !! Traveling the world encountered with many care takers there is something very
"My entire 4 stars go towards Warren Naluz Claudia and the Fullerton team, including the Indonesian Lady (Powder Room), all concierge, some men in suits who i presume are from upper management who bothers to greet guests at 9 in the morning. A small exception would be this short hair lady who only greets her specific guests/client/corporate people.  -1 star because the management took it away from the staff. Severely understaffed. Every other component is a 0.  *advise that all guests lower their expectation to avoid disappointment and management to take this review very seriously*  Breakfast: (basically this is where if there was a negative review function i would employ)  I saw a european family basically gagging, im sure your executive board or upper management is definitely"
Great service from staff Lalikumar & Miyako. They are friendly and catered to our needs. The food are great and I love their unlimited savoury and tea. This is the best high tea that I have before. Will definitely visit this place again
"Dear Justin,  Thank you for a very commendable & excellent guest service you have given & shown in our recent stay at The Fullerton Hotel for me & my wife at the heritage room on Room 517 from 29-31 Mar 2021. It was a very enjoyable & memorable stay for us in our 25th marriage anniversary despite we could not leave the country, & we really look forward & planning in going back again very soon. Your hotel displayed a exceptionally great guest/customer experience with great attentive staffs & front counter staff & experience.  This indeed is a very wonderful experience we had staying in your hotel. Special thanks to you front desk Justin Phua, and to Nicholas Tan, Claudia Tan too who had arrange for us a special early check in.   May I wish you all continue such great attitude in"
"Mediocre 1 time serving snacks during canapés hour though with unlimited drinks which really caught us by surprise in the club lounge. However the service recovery team did a excellent job. Avoid Premier Collyer Suite units facing Bank Of China and other offices buildings. Hope year end staycation will change our impression with the hotel. Thank you Revathy, Roszel and Nicolas for the commendable services."
Pre-Arrival was promising with the pre arrival email for facilities booking so as the 11am early check in offer which we declined as we were working that Wednesday.   Check into a courtyard room that we initially booked at 5pm on a Wednesday 24th March. We were given into a room (not going to mention the number) which there was a table and 2 chairs outside the window with people looking in. It would be nice if there were like fake plants instead or given to another courtyard room with a little bit of privacy where nobody could stand directly outside the window looking in.   We decided to change our room and we decided why not spend a little more for an upgrade to the marina bay view instead which is so much worth it. Room was not ready as we were shown into a room that was under
"Amazing food and very patient, attentive staff! Very friendly and made the entire dining experience pleasant. The Easter Brunch was very fun, filled with cute desserts and snacks. Big Thanks to Lalikumar, Jeannie, Lalaine & Albert!"
Last met Lalikumar at Courtyard for my birthday high tea last year and so glad to see him again for my staycation now. He is always attentive and friendly to us and hope to be served by him again! He always make sure our dining experience is a great and memorable one!
Lalikumar has been very helpful and service was on point  The food was decent  Something to come for is the dessert as there is a huge range of cakes and macaroon  Will recommend people to come here for a chill day
Spend a relaxing afternoon at Fullerton Hotel Courtyard  enjoying the Easter weekend afternoon tea with my family. Both young & old enjoyed the delicious & colourful afternoon tea. Many thanks to Mr Rozel & Mr Lalikumar for making our stay at Fullerton Hotel a memorable & pleasent one. Their dedication as well as their attention to customer satisfaction is phenomenal  My family we definitely return to Fullerton hotel again.  Yours Sincerely   Raymond Lee
"Service was excellent, the iced tea they served as an opening is amazing! We forgot to mention of our dietary requirements prior to our arrival but they made it happen anyways last minute.   Exceptional mention to Lallikumar, Albert, Steve & Camilla. They really made the experience an enjoyable one."
"Served by Lalikumar, Albert, Steve and Camilia. Delightful experience making us feel welcomed! Always able to answer to our questions. Never miss in making sure we are having an ultimate experience. Kudos!"
"Really pretty view of MBS! what really stands out for me this trip is that I called in the middle of the night as the bed was too hard for my comfort. The housekeeping manager dropped by in the morning, asked how I was and got her team to put a mattress topper to soften the bed. Truly a world class hotel service! The only downside was that Straits club offerings are now minimal."
Just had lunch at the Courtyard at Fullerton Hotel. The service here is fantastic. Abi and Lalikumar were very friendly and made our visit here memorable. The food was very nice and ambience here is good too.
I had a lovely lunch at the Courtyard with my family. The food was tasty and the service is very good. Would recommend families to come here for a meal. Special thanks to Abigael and Lalikumar for the excellent service.
"Had buffet at Town Restaurant, the food, service and ambience was excellent! Highly recommend ! Would like to thank Lalikumar, Kim and Mei ! Thank you for making it a special evening for us ! Will be back !!:)"
"Great service! Accommodate to all of our request. Food was decent with never ending drinks, would definitely come back. High quality drinks. Shout out to Nicholas, Gabriel and Aladin who were super friendly."
The food was great & the service was as good. Love the special birthday cake surprise. Special thanks to Lalikumar amd Camilla for being great hosts & taking care of all our needs. Would definitely come back for the awesome experience.
"My husband and I bought this staycation voucher last year June2020. We were so excited that we needed to do a video of our way to this #1 Luxury Hotel in Singapore. ( by the way it is our first time) As we normally travel outside but since we can’t, so why not?!:)  Lets start with Concierge: The staff did helped us (with luggage)and welcomed us soon as we arrived. Apologies that I didn’t get their name but I will be posting their photos here:)  Front Office: MIRA took care of our check in, very well delivered and confidently explained every single information that we needed to know. She even stepped out to send us to the lift.   Room: It was spotless clean, bed was tidy enough that we didn’t even jumped on till bed time. Well we made use of the chaise lounge couch instead."
We ordered the Blessings set on our visit to Jade. The food was delicious and the service we have received was outstanding. Thank you Penny for the warm service and constantly checking on us! It was a memorable night.
I was very pleased with the afternoon tea that allow us to saviour unlimited coffee and different types of tea. 4 of us were allowed to have 8 types of tea and coffee. The food comprised of sweet and savoury desserts and the savoury allowed to refill. The ambience was great and the service was also wonderful. The afternoon tea was so much that we need to skip the dinner. Worth to come and great place to relax and enjoy the afternoon.

The rate inclusions are:  Complimentary upgrade to Heritage Room (from Premium Courtyard) Breakfast for 2pax $100 dining credits per stay  Pre-arrival – I received my email 5 days prior to my stay and it requires you to complete their online form. The email also listing some activities (both paid and complimentary) which you want to consider as an in-house guest.  Hotel Interiors – Its been a while since I stepped into Fullerton and I forgot how nice the interior actually is. The hardware seems very well maintained and I can see where the ‘luxury’ banner comes from.  Check In – The front desk area was surprisingly occupied at 1230pm on a weekday
"My friend and I stayed at the Fullerton Hotel using a lockdown voucher. I just wanted to take this moment to give a shout out to the amazing pool attendant - Sall. Sall was super friendly, polite and so attentive. He was so interesting to talk to and really made our pool time special. I hope he knows how wonderful and lovely he is. Thank you Sall!"
"My husband and I stayed for 2 nights in December with the Suite Compliments package and we were very impressed with the service. From check-in to check-out everyone we encountered was exceptional. A special shout-out to Paolo from the Straits Lounge, and Ramli, Jack, Miyako, and Abigail from breakfast."
"My family and I would like to thank all the staff who served and interacted with us one way or another. They have made our stay there a very cherished and memorable one.  From the time we stepped into the premises on Fri March 19th, the young gentleman who manned the temperature station who noticed our bags and clearly directed us to the check in counter, we were already very appreciative.  Then the lady who directed us to have our seats whilst we filled up forms to another lady who checked us in. When my wife locked herself out of our adjoining room, the gentleman who responded to our call so promptly to all the ladies and gentlemen on the 4th level straits club who attended to us.  You all have been wonderful - warm, friendly and attentive, despite the long hours of standing,"
I would like to recommend this hotel because the service and concierge staff were very professional and thoughtful. I would like to specially thank staff Mr Hafizuddin and Ms Mira for their tremendous effort in making my stay there as if i were a VIP. Thank you guys so much and i hope you guys will continue to upkeep the Fullerton name!
"Wonderful customer service, everyone was extremely friendly and accomodating. Especially Steve, Lily, May and Camilla that took good care of our whole family. Food was amazing, rooms were clean and overall this staycation was worth it. I'd rate 6 stars if Tripadvisor had the option!"
"I stayed at the Fullerton hotel in Oct 2020 and had a wonderful time. I’m not sure what suite we had but it was done up very tastefully in a distinctly old-world, heritage style, spacious and had a balcony with stunning views overlooking the Singapore river, CBD & museum district. The pool, although small, also afforded a great view and is gorgeously lit up at night.  The staff were also very helpful when it came to my dietary restrictions (gluten free) and prepared a selection of GF pastries/snacks at the lounge."
"Decided to take some time off for a quick 2D1N Staycation with the hubby and I must say that this was definitely the best decision ever!   The attention to detail, the service, the quality was simple spectacular. Check in was a breeze and Warren is simply the nicest front office personnel I have ever dealt with. He was courteous, friendly and checked us in really quickly! I had a small little issue but Warren really went above and beyond to sort it out in under 2 hours. That is pure class and passion!   The room is squeaky clean and the bed is super comfy. I think the housekeepers must have placed a lot of love in ensuring everything was set nicely.   We also had dinner there and we met Lalikumar. The food was great and I must point out how they cared for the smallest of details"
"Kids friendly hotel. Took initiative to care and keep a child calm and happy with the ice cream pass, colouring book, crayons and kids toiletries, AMAZING! All mothers and caregivers will love it like i do!   Stayed at the newly renovated Heritage Room with huge bathroom, a long and cosy lounge sofa, walk-in wardrobe and what more could I ask for. Most favourite part for me is the electric toilet seat (warm seat and bidet) and the swimming pool (warm nice water temperature).  Special thanks and compliments to Justin, Kate (Front Office), Arianne (Cake Boutique), Ling (In-Room Dining), Mayang for giving us a service from the heart. Times are bad but your service remain the best."
"We were pleasantly overwhelmed by Vivian's great hospitality and immaculate attention to detail. Right from check-in, Vivian made sure that we were well taken care of. When our rooms weren't ready, she immediately suggested we could be ushered to a private room to wait. And when we suggested going for a quick bite at Town, she immediately took the initiative and went the extra mile to place a reservation for us.  I was particularly impressed by how she single-handedly handled our luggage to be placed in their holding area without waiting for another colleague to help her. She was so hands-on and attentive to every detail and made the entire experience just absolutely fabulous and welcoming. We wish to let the Fullerton management know what a great staff you have and what an"
Stayed at The Fullerton as part of our 5th Wedding Anniversary celebration and I will say they take customer service to th3 next level here. We were in an Esplanade Room which was very large and had everything you needed. Check in during COVID was seamless and very efficient  It was the perfect place for our getaway.
"A wonderful retreat for family and kids from the bustling city life with personalised service and reassuring safety measures.   The experience has been enriched with new activities for children, such as the koi feeding session. It was the first time that my kids could feed the koi and they thoroughly enjoyed it.  They even got to sleep in a glamping tent under the starlit ceiling, all within the comfort of the hotel room.  Using of facilities and dining experience were also very well managed with appropriate safety measures and still provided abundant assurance and time for us to enjoy the experiences.  Overall, a very satisfying staycation for the young and the not-so-young, with our mental, health and stomach well-taken care of!"
"We stayed over at Fullerton Hotel, a 3D2N staycation for my birthday. Joined their Maritime Tour, Monument Tour and Farm Tour over the 3 days. All guides really knew their stuff well, sharing with us the stories of old & new  behind this magnificent building. We pampered ourselved with hightea at the courtyard. The savouries were pretty good... but the sweets, too sweet. So if u have a sweet tooth, go for it. :) the service is impeccable.. the servers were attentive and detailed, proactively asked if we would like a group photo.. if our teas needed refilling.. would we like other items. They were so sweet, giving us a slice of a dark ganache cake & printing our our photo for a birthday card. Super awww... :) they were also considerate in their attention and not hover around us."
"A big thank you to Hafiz who is in charge of the concierge for guiding us. Mira who is under reception assist me with the reservation, Claudia also under reception for upgrading my room to one of the best room ever and Justin who is the duty manager for checking us into our rooms smoothly! All of them served us with warm smiles which makes our stay much more welcoming. This is one of the hotel that I will pay for their great service!   Thank you!!"
"I got a call a day before our check-in to prepare our family for our stay.  They pre-recorded our special request which is an extra bed for my son.  They offered an early check-in as early as 9AM.  Unfortunately, we were not able to come early.  We reached the hotel before 3PM.  Everyone in the hotel is very warm and accommodating.    Our check-in and check-out were done by Kate Reyes.  Since we were not able to avail the early check-in, she accommodated our request for late check out.  She happily assisted us on both transactions, very professional and courteous.  The hotel room is well-maintained.  It is facing the street but we had a good sleep all throughout our stay.    Staff and dishes at The Courtyard are all nice.  We had a well-rested weekend.  This hotel is highly"
"1) I booked through KKday and requested for a rollaway bed. Was told I have to request at checkin and subject to availability. Then at checkin was told that I should have pre booked the rollaway and that all the rollaway are taken. Stressful start to our holiday.  2) was told the only slot available for breakfast is at 730am. No sleeping in then I guess.  3) was told you have to book pool slots and it's only available at 7am or 1130am which either clashes with breakfast or checkout.  4) our $100 dining voucher had a whole bunch of conditions and couldn't be used for the afternoon tea along with a whole long list of other things... we could use it for in-room dining but it wasn't enough to cover a meal for 3 as its very overpriced.   If I had known it would be like this, I'd have"
"Stayed with my family during the CNY period back in Feb. Grand CNY decors were observed from the exteriors to the interiors, with complimentary oranges gift bag per room. These gave a great festive feel. The front desk proactively arranged our rooms to be located on the same floor and near each other when they knew we are from the same family, despite different bookings. The day before check-in, a staff called to inform on the early check-in time to avoid check-in crowd, as such check-in was swift without a long queue. Service on the whole is excellent and personalized. Our bookings came with F&B vouchers so we chose to utilize it at Town Restaurant over dinner, which was good. Breakfast came with a good variety of choices, overall the dishes are pretty acceptable although the"
"Checking in was a breeze. The staff answered all my questions and doubts. Shoe shine and ice bucket was provided when requested. Although there was no pillow menu when it says that the room has it. As for the room, It is clean and nice. My only problem is that the tv was not really working. The remote or tv has some sort of problem and we could watch anything except for the introduction page. The use of the compendium tablet was also good and easy and provided many useful info. As for the facilities, we only went to the pool which we had to make a booking for the timing slot. Once arrived at the pool they provided towels. The staff at the pool ensured that the pool temperature was perfect and also provided boxed alkaline water which was great and I am thankful. As for breakfast,"
"Had my short staycation here and for someone who doesn't do a lot of staycays, i was absolutely impressed with this hotel. My stay was simply delightful and there wasn't any problems throughout my check in till my check out period. The room that i had was super cozy and had that luxurious feel. The bathtub was one of the highlight of the hotel, spacious and relaxing. The other highlight would be the view, although partially blocked by a building, i still had a good view to enjoy during the day and night.  And that was just the hotel room. The service was absolutely amazing too. Hotel staffs were friendly and helpful and i couldn't think of anything negative to say about them. Mira from Reception made sure that i had everything that i needed for the stay.  Hafiz from Concierge"
"Our family just celebrated 3 belated birthdays with a short staycation from the 7-9 March at this top-rated hotel and unanimously agreed that it was without doubt deserving of its current pole position amongst Singapore hotels. Even the most discerning and demanding of seasoned travellers will be thoroughly convinced after a stay at the Fullerton that legendary hotels with sterling service standards do exist today! Unparalleled hospitality was shown to us by a team of staff that demonstrated genuine care and concern for their guests' well-being and doing so with admirable well-oiled teamwork and polished efficiency. From reservation, to check-in, to housekeeping and concierge services, to check-out, the entire experience was seamlessly and delightfully orchestrated by a team of"
"I celebrated the birthday of my friend in this hotel and it was an amazing experience. Why makes it amazing is because of their staff who are friendly, accommodating, warmth and are all professional. @kaye their duty manager provide an extra ordinary service by understanding the needs of her guests. It’s a good experience to one of the most iconic hotel on SG. This is highly  recommended hotel to visit."
"excellent service, staffs were very friendly, special mention to breakfast place staff Abigal for the surprise of printing our pic as a souvenir to us as well as a stalk of rose knowing it was our wedding weekend stay.  eventhough I believe they do that for others too, but it made our day a better one. From the housekeepers, front desk to the cake shop, all of them were always on their smiles.  For a hotel that has been there for decades and an iconic landmark of sg, it is well maintained, clean and rooms were spacious. We stayed 3 night in both palladian and fullerton suite which we had a wonderful time. Will definitely make it a yearly event for us for our anniversary. Only downside will be their straits club access breakfast. It was busy and they were understaffed. Waited"
"We had a great stay at Fullerton. Was celebrating a birthday and we were granted early check in and the room was nicely decorated with a slice of cake! Kate from front desk called to ask about our arrival time and Mira checked us in efficiently. There was no crowd at all and they were extremely professional and explained the slot booking of the pool and gym.  We had lunch at Jade and the service and food were generally good, but some dishes were far too salty for our liking. It would have been better if the staff could take initiative to ask how the food was. We had some issues with neighbours making excessive noise in the middle of the night but the duty manager, Mr Andrew was quick to resolve it and came personally to ensure the issue does not reoccur. Late check out was given"
"Very pleased with the staff of Fullerton. Top notch service and consistently all the way throughout our stay from the moment we check-in you can feel the quality of service, special thanks to Mr. Paolo of straight club lounge very friendly and accommodative."
Friendly and excellent service from lalikumar and Jennie from the courtyard.  Service staff at Fullerton were also very helpful and polite. Delectable breakfast. Extremely satisfied with my stay there :)
"Nostalgic and excellent stay at the Fullerton Hotel.   My wife and I had a wonderful two-night staycation (1 for 1) at the hotel..  The hotel heritage display brought back vivid fond memories of our younger days' experiences of the Fullerton and Clifford Pier areas..  The room and venue facilities exceeded our expectations - the ambience, comfort and staff service were more than just up to mark - the staff in particular were attentive and helpful.   The room was very  clean, large and very comfortable. The check-in and check-out were seamless and a breeze. Thanks, Fullerton, for a memorable stay for my wife and I.   JM and YM"
由于疫情的关系。2/28 日办理入住花了40分钟左右的时间。进入房间已经是下午4:00左右了。 所以请大家办理入住要有心理准备，如果大厅客满必须到室外炎热的空间等待。尤其是在假日期间。 我們入住的房間是City view尚未裝修過的類型装修是真的已经旧了 整体清洁还算OK。但是椅子上明显的有灰尘。床头灯也有一展完全不会亮。双人床却是两张床垫拼接在一起，中间有一道缝隙著實不舒服。 厕所内的备品只有最基本的牙刷。和沐浴类用品。连浴帽也都没有。 房间内的水只有两瓶非常小支的。入住期间也没有补充。明显不足。 不知道是否是节省成本。房间那没有一个信封便条纸和一支笔。需要的人必须自己准备。  餐厅几乎都是客满的。有4位女性客人讲话非常大声，也没有见餐厅人员去制止他们。著實了影响到其他的人。 这一点是客人必须自爱的部分。尤其是在疫情期间。四位女性年轻人以为自己包下来全部的餐厅大声喧哗嬉闹。 还有一个非常大的缺点就是停车场距离房间非常遥远。 整体服务还算好。
"My husband and I are really impressed with the service here at the high tea buffet at the Courtyard. Service team is very enthusiastic, polite, and friendly.   We really love the special touch they added when they presented us with a birthday card that has our photo on it!   Special thanks to lalikumar and his team. I was told by a couple of friends even before I came for my high tea that Lalikumar’s service is so awesome that I should look forward to that. I truly enjoyed this high tea experience, and so did my husband!"
Spent 3D2N at Fullerton to celebrate our wedding anniversary.   - Service is definitely world class. - Jade Restaurant’s Ee Fu Noodle is a must have. - Fullerton Breakfast (Nasi Lemak) is a must have.  - Gym amenities were quiet and clean.
"Had a night stay in this hotel with credit point to use for the meal. The check in is a bit long due to safe management measure with every booking allocated a seat to wait for your turn. The staff assigning a bit loud on his voice and had to remind on the mandatory form to fill up by STB. The check in staff was friendly and explained the credit, facilities arrangements and booking.  The breakfast was at lobby area (Town) which served many local foods. We had ordered Nasi Lemak with aromatic coconut rice, ikan bilis, chicken drumstick and good chilli. The staff will respond to you very fast maybe due to the pandemic.  The spa, gym and swimming pool are at 1M level, but you have to book the slot to utilise it. The pool is a bit unclean as you swim, you can see many foreign objects"
"Stayed at Fullerton with a friend during a staycation in December 2020 with a Fave voucher, which included an afternoon tea and a bottle of wine.   We arrived earlier than the standard check-in time (at around 1pm), fully aware that we might not be able to check-in and were completely willing to leave our bags until the check-in time. To our surprise and complete delight, the staff at the reception was very prompt in apologising that while our previously assigned city view room wasn't ready (he certainly didn't need to since we came early), there was another room that we could check in to and apologising once again that the view didn't have a city view - something we certainly didn't mind.   Upon entering the room, we were completely delighted to discover a gem of the room - it"
"This is the first time I had my staycation in this hotel. I must say, that I love each interaction with the staff! Be it from reservation, Breakfast Area and also the Reception Desk. A big shoutout to Revathy from Reception . As she check-in for us. First of all, she noticed that I queuing for about 3 minutes. She then quickly offered me to check-in to a counter that is not open I assume. On top of that, she wished me Happy Anniversary and also escorted me to the lift. She even show me where's the location for my Breakfast.  Warm Welcome & Amazing Hospitality!!!!"
"We stayed here for one night during the Chinese New Year week. Love the CNY decor. We have stayed in literally hundreds of hotel around the world and this rates up near if not at the top! Great service and it is the service  of the staff that puts this hotel right up there. They are genuinely friendly and amazing. Special shoutout to Claudia (front desk) & Abigael (cafe).  Room is on the spot and bathroom is huge! Loved it! The Harman Kardon speaker in the room is awesome! We have no qualms about fully recommending you to my friends. So if you are looking for a lovely hotel to stay, look no further than The Fullerton Hotel. Thank you for the wonderful stay."
"What a better way to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary in Fullerton Hotel, Singapore. Our Heritage Room was upgraded to Quay Room with Balcony. Served with Speciality Lobster Nasi Lemak in the room . Wonderful and well pampered day we had. Breakfast was great . We were served diligently by a Good team member lead by Manager Steve, Mei, Lily and Annie. Stalk of Rose and Chocolate cake as a surprise for our Memorable Wedding Anniversary. Great job guys ! Keep up the good work."
"We did a 2D1N staycation at the heritage room with club lounge access and it was definitely one of the most amazing experience we’ve had!!  The rooms were well appointed (come on, its Fullerton!) and rooms were surprising well upkept given that the hotel is in a heritage building. Bed was definitely one of the most comfortable. we found the pillow to be too soft for our liking and we were given better memory foam pillows upon request.  The bathtub is well sized and water pressure of the shower was excellent. Toilet came with a bidet (yes those japanese type!) which was a nice touch.  House keeping and guest relations were quick to respond to all our request!  The highlight of our stay was definitely the straits club and we received very warm service from the team (special thanks"
"Nice decorations in the hotel itself, to add to the Chinese New Year atmosphere. On the exterior, beautiful light ups too. Room was very clean and with a balcony which you can see the marina bay sands view!"
"Stayed 2 nights. Lovely room and amazing view. we had our post wedding celebration at Towne restaurant with fantastic food and service by Jun wee, Ramli, Yalin. The local dishes were the star. Sat outside and the ambience was perfect. Thanks team!"
"Went with my partner. We checked in at 3pm, but a friend of ours got early check in at 10am (so request for early check in if that's your thing). The exterior is gorgeous - it's the Fullerton after all. Inside it was really grand, with Chinese decor of red lanterns and banners. We stayed at a heritage room. The room is much bigger than we expected: there are stairs that lead to the room and a really high ceiling. It was luxurious - we thought we were in the wrong room. The view is obstructed by some barriers though. But we could still see the MBS from the room. Bathroom was amazing, large bathtub and shower, well lit vanity, marble. There's another kind of heritage room, with a balcony. The view was tall skyscrapers and the Fullerton Bay. So if you want some urban Parisian"
"We held our wedding lunch at Fullerton Hotel Straits Room last year and had the most amazing experience.  Our wedding coordinator Violette was very kind and helpful in arranging all requests in the months leading to the wedding. She was also very knowledgeable and experienced. A very committed coordinator who attend to your needs even when she is away from work.   The banquet manager Garan was also very helpful and friendly; he is super approachable, the person you can count on on your big day. Kudos to his team for a smooth and memorable wedding.  This review might have came late but each time we enter Fullerton Hotel, it brings back all the beautiful memories. Fullerton has became a familiar place to us.   We are very happy and pleased with the Fullerton experience for our big"
"You would expect that the hotel would be understaffed over CNY but even if they were, guests wouldn't be able to tell. Service was great, especially from the duo, Nicholas and Sylvia, at the Straits Club. The two were attentive and friendly.  Well done!"
"The FINEST hotel in Singapore. The service is unmatched. This hotel has excellent guest service, they exceed all of your expectations, friendly, attentive, quick, caring and accurate. You couldn't ask for more.. but, if you could think of anything else, just ask, they will accommodate you. Special thanks to all the staff who took care of us during our short stay. I'll start with Roszel, WARREN, KATE, Nicholas and Siti of front office. Thank you for your assistance from the time we arrived until we check-out. We really liked the room you have given us plus the birthday setup for my husband. And special shoutout to Imran, FISH, LAILANIE, Cherry and Leah of Town restaurant for their commendable services and for making us feel welcome and at home. The great service, the food and"
"Finally got to experience staying at the old GPO building. Got a room on 4th floor. Room came with The Straits Lounge for Afternoon Tea, Evening canapes & Breakfast. Also signed up the free Fullerton Monumrmt Tour & Maritime Journey Tour (yes, free registration hotel guests).   Room is nice, big, high comfy bed, big tub (no bath salts provided), great location to explore Marina Bay area & even to Chinatown & Tanjore Pagar by walking. The staff were good and responsive.   Downsides or things to gripe, the food all at The Straits Lounge is nothing to shout about."
Good Bathtub (good ergonomic and fills up fast) Customer Service Water pressure Bed comfortable Bluetooth speakers Aircon Electronic curtains  Can be improved/bad Food taste at club lounge Decor in room Bathroom floor was always wet
"It’s our first time staying at the Fullerton although we’ve eaten at the buffet many times.  Lovely room, delightful staff. We were on a package with afternoon team and club room cocktails and canapés at 6pm.  What we loved though was breakfast on the river, the familiar faces of professional and warming staff who really make as feel at home. The food was great and it’s always service with a smile.  Well done to the Fullerton, For a brief moment we felt we weren’t living in a crazy pandemic!"
"A wonderful high tea experience. Decent variety of excellently made food. Ambience is great, while the staff are attentive and friendly. Thoroughly enjoyed my time here  and it is definitely worth coming again!"
"From the moment we enter we both in awe at the beauty and the spacious of the room. Facing Marina Bay Sand it has a beautiful both morning and evening scene. It was an ideal plan to take our wedding photos at one of A historic hotel.Staff was friendly and very attentive to our needs. One example was Mr Sal who take care of the pool.Not only he gave us a warm greetings but we feel so welcome there with his 1st class service.2nd was the Concierge service, my in laws was lost trying to find the carpark.He guided them all the way till they reach.I was touched.Thank you"
"This must be one of the best places for staycation in town! We’re utterly impressed by the quality and level of service we received. Although there was a small glitch in the beginning, it was quickly resolved and we were compensated with the signature Fullerton teddy bears as a gesture of good will. We were also given a bottle of red wine as well as some desserts and in-room accessories to celebrate our anniversary.  We absolutely loved the suite - the view, the facilities, the bar, and every single attention to details offered by the hotel staff. We’d like to thank Andrew (the duty manager) and Mira from the receptionist team, Paulo who served us in the Straits Club, Weilun in the Town restaurant, and Alson in Jade (as well as many others of course) for their excellent service"
"Went for 1 night staycation with 2 other sisters. Nice ambience with beautiful CNY deco. Very thankful to Snr Duty Mgr, Ms Revathy Ganesan, for giving us complimentary extra bed, high tea & cocktail. It was indeed a very pleasant surprise! Mr Nicholas Wong, Straits Club Mgr, & most staff we met are friendly, courteous, hospitable & attentive to our needs. We had an enjoyable time & felt very welcome. Thumbs-up for excellent service rendered. However, food at Town restaurant is below my expectation. Found their fish maw soup & drunken prawns too starchy. Hope food wise can be improved. Overall, a great & wonderful experience!"
"We had the Marina Bay room, the balcony with the most beautiful view. Staff are great and so helpful. The location view and the walk around is brilliant. Our experience in the Jade restaurant fantastic. Yvonne, joppy, chef Leong and steph were amazing people. Stay at Fullerton😊"
Great hotel and services. Room upgraded and compliments gift sparkle fruit juice alcohol free and teddy bear. Thanks to Warren Naluz for the upgraded room which facing Spore river. Superb! Will come again!;)
"Had our wedding banquet at The Fullerton Hotel. It was a last minute  booking and Gwendolin was very responsive and we managed to confirm all the details for the wedding within a short period of time. All the staff helping out during the wedding banquet were very friendly. Also, a shoutout to Mr Benedict for his professionalism and making the March in a less nervous one :)  special thanks to Gwendolin and Benedict for the thoughtful birthday cake and flowers!   Fantastic experience ! THANK YOU !"
It’s great to receive excellent customer service coupled with a nostalgic atmosphere in the ever distinctive architecture of Fullerton hotel. We really enjoyed our stay here from the sumptuous delectable Cantonese dinner at Jade to the warm hospitality from Town restaurant.
We had a great time staying at the fullerton hotel.  Fullerton experience = Fullertonized  Thank you for the warm welcome of ms Kate Reyes. We did enjoy and will most likely recommend this to our friends
"Been here a couple of times and I have to say, this is my favorite place to go to for some light meal and wine with friends or with my boyfriend. Not only that the food are great, the team that you have here are really accommodating and friendly too! (Makes the visit more fun!) Special mention to Paolo and Chai Yi, for being so approachable and friendly, really good service! Keep it up!"
"I once visited the Fullerton, and the staff named Paolo and Chai Yi have accommodated us nicely on the way to the straits club lounge. Paolo is a cool guy you’d like to talk with, and he will keep you company when the place is less crowded.  The food there is delicious, especially the truffle pasta, a must-try.  Thumbs up!"
"My daughter said ""Mama, I love it here..."" she wants to come back again. From the booking to our checkout, the transaction was smooth. We were so amazed by the ambiance of the hotel. The Duty Manager, Kate Reyes, was very nice to assist us with settling in. She attends to our requests also politely. Do look for her during your stay.   Overall, we had a very pleasant stay. We will definitely recommend Fullerton Hotel to our friends.  Thanks again and hope we can comeback again soon!"
