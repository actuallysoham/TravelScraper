"Hostel like hotel.  Compact, clean and cosy room. But toilet always wet cos cannot block shower water splash  No TV, no refrigerator, no bottle drink in room. Outside got refrigerator can share but put yr fd at yr own risk. Bottle drink can go downstairs buy got many shop. No TV, use handphone play until sleep.   Toothbrush, shaver, comb need ask counter  No housekeeping if short stay. Go counter ask for new towel and tissue paper  Look like got many long term people stay. Can see people cook and wash clothes like their own house."

"Needed a place for a staycation for a group of 6 and this was perfect! We had our own spaces (4 bedrooms), enough toilets, and a shared dining area with a kitchenette if we wanted to mingle. Loved it and would come again."
"Checked into the small room at level 6, room wasn't sound proof, thin walls, faulty electric kettle. Feedback this to Mr Jay Vincent (manager) who happened to be around the front desk. He was very approachable and listen patiently to our feedback and was open to the idea of upgrading our room. Was happy that we managed to receive a complimentary room upgrade and a working and improved electric kettle for the night. Thank you for the excellent service."
"I'm writing this at 2am, as there is an on going drilling noises from nearby that disturb my sleep and I'm frustrated can't sleep now. It happened yesterday too and I called to reception to complain, I'm not sure whether the noise stop or I eventually fall aslp due to super tired. And it happens again now. It started around 12am but I was doing so i was hoping it will stop by the time i go to sleep. But sadly it did not, and it is 2am now. Call to inform the reception at 1.30am but the noise still there. I guess may be it is out of their control?  The hotel itself is good and staff are friendly and helpful. Bed is comfortable. But because of the disturb sleep, i'm really not in the mood to share much on it. I can only five it 5 stars.   Hope the hotel will settle the noise for"
"Paid an upgrade to One of a Kind Plus room and it was soooooo worth it!!! You get a spacious room with your own private kitchenette and a small dining area that could sit up to 4 people. Hotel itself is very instagram-worthy and has a very good vibe all around. My friend and I really enjoyed our time in the GIF photo booth HAHAHA (I must say, those GIFs are of such high quality with almost built-in meitu photoshop effect that made my skin look flawless ^^ )  Hotel is very well located within Funan Mall and is of walking distance to Raffles City, City Link Mall and Suntec City! As a hotel guest, by flashing our room keys, we are able to get discounts in multiple eating outlets in Funan Mall too~  I would also like to thank the whole Lyf Guard Team, especially to Hafiz and Win,"
"Have always wanted to stay at Lyf Funan and I'm glad that I finally tried it out! We booked for One of a Kind Room using the SingapoRediscover voucher, and decided to top up and upgrade ourselves to the One of a Kind plus, and I would definitely recommend to upgrade to this room!!!!! For the upgrade, we got a bigger room (18 sqm vs 27 sqm), along with a private kitchenette, fridge and a TV in the room too!!   It was definitely interesting to check out the various co-living spaces in the hotel, and staying in the hotel meant discounts when you dine in at select F&B establishments in Funan too! If not, its always just a short walk away from Raffles City Shopping Center or Clarke Quay!   Special shoutout to the Lyfguard team that completed our amazing experience! Daniel - who was"
"Value for money comes to mind when I’m thinking of this property. Feels like a combination of Moxy and Aloft under the Marriott group that they’re going for, which is not so much my cup of tea (even though I’m in my 20s and part of their target audience). Got an upgrade to the One of a Kind Studio Plus as a Platinum Ascott Star Rewards member but no other benefits beyond that. Not that I’m ruling this property out of my book, but if the price is right I might be back... Overall a good stay."
"I want to commend Justin for his wonderful service. He took the time to give us a tour of Lyf as it was our first time there.   I've stayed in many hotels around Singapore, and very few will draw me back simply because of the great service of the staff. However, I'll definitely be booking with you in the future and hopefully, I'll have the pleasure of seeing Justin there again next time."
lyf is right above a mall so super convenient to buy food and all. mall has lotsa eateries and a supermarket. there are also cafes and also shops selling clothing. great mall to check out.  rooms are really small but very modern and new. rooms are more suited for young groups of people due to its small size. bed wasnt the most comfortable either. do note standard rooms do not come with tv so bring along your own entertainment. general feel is that lyf is midway between a hostel and a hotel.  there is a common kitchen on the lower floor to whip up your own meal. the reception area has tables and chairs for people to do their work. there are also washers and dryers at entrance of the hotel.  Location is near capitol and cityhall mrt. my sister and i visited this hotel several
Good Very convenient. Located above funan with lots of food options. Located in civic district. Walking distance to Merlion park city hall mrt. Warm service at reception.   Bad Air con is weak. Flush is also weak. Floor seems sticky.
"Stayed here for 1 night in October 2020 for a quick staycation. Paid about $100 SGD booking directly through the hotel site. Fairly basic small room with a queen size mattress, no tv and no fridge in the room. No bottled water provided. Allocated a room with a view over the adjacent laneway: some noise from people talking below and vans moving around, plus noise from nearby aircon units. Also neighbour noise in the corridor and some stomping from upstairs neighbours. Additional noise from nearby fire station sirens. Small bathroom with a rainshower and no bath. No pool. Located above the Funan mall. Friendly front desk staff."
"Stayed here a number of times so far and have quite a few upcoming multi-day bookings. Why? Good price, superb location, comfy bed, room though small, has a good use of space with their design, has rain shower, pretty clean generally and you can get almost anything downstairs in Funan. It's a different environment for me from working from home and office, I could have some time on my own for gaming and reading as well.   Checkin requires use of the mobile app, but if there are issues, physical keycard will be issued. I got used to the mobile app keycard. Side note: the lyf staff at checkin were really welcoming.   Though breakfast is not provided, you can make use of some of the F&B discounts in Funan for specific stores. There is also a self serving Starbucks machine (from $3)"
"Quasi-industrial pulped by murmurs of retrofuturism and the kaleidoscopically colorful greeted as we first set foot in Lyf Funan's lobby - a rather huge departure from the typical austere co-living circumstances originally envisioned, then again different might be interesting. Logging our arrival entailed supplying the god's honest truth to a QR code-instigated web questionnaire - this wasn't quite hassle-free though owing to much flustered back and forth transpiring ad interim.  Our okay sized One Of A Kind Plus studio elucidated luxe pauvre: vanilla glazed interiors hedging single solid wood queen platform bed amalgamated with well-fitted kitchenette, swish monochromatic bathroom abutting. Clean, bright and comfy yee-haw. The too Smart TV however inexorably pulled a"
"I booked a staycation recently at Lyf because I really like the “hostel” concept with communal areas like the kitchen and mini gym area. The design concept of the hotel is also fresh and edgy.   The kitchenette in the room was very well equipped and the bathroom was very roomy as well.   However, the room (1116) I was given did not have any views from the window as it was a corner room and the layout was not the same as the one shown in the picture. Instead of having a table for proper dining, It was a bar top carpentry which was just beside the bed. The space felt smaller than it was depicted on the web. Another thing to note was the whole of 11th floor did not smell very pleasant once you exit from the lift, perhaps there were uncleared trash at the common area.   Nonetheless,"
After many months of not having a Staycation and travelling due to Covid 19 circumstances. Singapore has slowly open up to having Staycations once again in our new normal. LYF Funan was my choice as it's a brand new hotel and it is located in the City Hall area or rather above Funan Shopping mall. Booked a Up & Down Bunk Studio at a perfect rate for 3days 2Nites!  Room is small but good enough for me and my family. There is a bed on bottom and bunk bed above. WiFi is FREE! ( No TV in room ) Had a room facing Central Fire Station which I requested for my daughter as she can see Fire Engines coming out ! Hotel interiors was fabulous and fantastic where u can go crazy taking photos at every angle of the hotel.
"We got married in early Sep and to kick start our 1-week honeymoon, we booked a 1 night stay  at Lyf@Funan with the “Movie & Stay Deal” at $188++. The receptionists were nice and professional and the facilities downstairs seems cool and cute. The receptionists also passed us 2 GV Super Passes and $40.00 GV F&B vouchers, which were part of the deal we signed up for.  However, when we went into the room (room 917), to our dismay, the room was really small and it looks like a hostel room. To be completely honest, I would say that SMU hostel room looks better than the room we saw. Even though the price of the room is in the decent hotel room range, there was no view at all and we could even catch a glimpse into the room next door.  We were really disappointed but we didn't want to"
"This is a very interesting concept of place to stay even for your own travel or probably a short-term stay.  Without the room key card, you are recommended to download their app which can turned into a bluetooth device to open your room door.  As this is a co-living space, much of the facilities are sharing with others. Including the water dispenser (not in use now due to safety measures) and refrigerator.   Unfortunately the refrigerator was too small to accommodate everyone on the same floor. When I open, it is already filled with lots of stuffs from other rooms.  There’s common space where you could chill and chat. Compact version of gym space and even a full kitchen with all tools.  I got the One of the Kind room which oversee the opposite Fort Canning Park. Great to be"
"When I come to this hotel , it was 2.30 pm. and I was impressed by the lobby which got tables and chairs.   I went to receptionist area , and check in was effortless.  I went to the room, to look around.  This room is nice and look like university student dorminatory. No TV?  no problem as you can use your Ipad or laptop computer to watch Netfilx, Youtube,  and other online movies .  Went to gym area.  Got two exercise bikes but there is not my type of bike. and fun equipment called Hamster Wheel. You can run inside the wheel ,like hamsters.  Best part is that 'you can spend long time in this hotel gym without any restrictions from hotel staffs . Their only requirement is you must follow the rules written on the wall.   During COV-19 period, other hotel gyms are closed, or being"
"I did a 1 night staycation. The room was a bit dusty but overall it was clean. There is no TV but with internet access I don't need the TV. I had to move the bed closer to the edge of the bed frame because the bed was a bit high and I was afraid I will fall if I get off the bed. There are fridges available to use but the fridges tend to be full - just don't get any big items - the fridge on my floor had no space and the fridges at the communal area was quite packed. Check in was a bit frustrating because you have to download an app and I had problems finding my reservation and the staff had to use my phone to help me check in - if the idea is to ensure contact less check-in, then has definitely failed. It was a good staycation since Lyft is located in Funan and there are various"
"Our young son and I, together with his football (soccer) team of 14 players, 2 coaches and several co-parents, stayed at Lyf Funan Hotel for 6 days last November 2019.    What can I say about Lyf Funan Hotel?  It’s a hotel with a totally different concept, but one that works great!  So apologies for this long review, but I just want to share my experience with this new and different hotel concept.    LOCATION : Lyf Funan Hotel is located in one end of Funan Mall (with lots of restaurants, retail shops and even a grocery).  We parents were never at a loss to feed our kids since McDonalds, KFC, Bread Talk and Little Caesar pizza are in the mall, plus several other restaurants to choose from.  We were able to shop for water, snacks and supplies from the grocery everyday.  There"
"Loved the modern touches and funky vibe of hotel. Situated on Level 4 of Funan Mall - a hotel in a mall...how cool is that?? Laundry facilities just outside of hotel entrance - it was a very convenient feature for hotel and certainly helped us after a long day of travel. Rooms were clean, functional, and quiet. Liked proximity to MRT station and other businesses nearby. Good value for the quality it provided. Our first visit to Singapore, and staying at Lyf Funan Hotel created a positive first impression. We will definitely stay there again the next time we visit Singapore!  Would also like to mention that we almost cancelled trip due to concerns of the Coronavirus outbreak, but after careful consideration we decided to continue with trip.  A big shout of appreciation to the"
"Love it. Amazing central location. Clean. Quiet. Spacious rooms. Friendly staff. Highly recommend. The renovation of Funan shopping center in which it is located is also good with cafes, theatre, Gym, etc."
"I can’t praise this brand new hotel (concept) enough. I paid £90 per night and stayed in room 710 with a little view at the back. The reason I loved the place was the clean cool room that had all I needed. The water fountain, ironing board in the hallway and the Nespresso vendor machine in the lobby and of course the great staff.  The hotel is so nice and for a small room it just had it all. No breakfast but lots of choice in the mall where the hotel is situated. There’s a massive communal kitchen and a gym but gym not ready yet.  Great water pressure, USB plugs and sockets by the bed. I switched off the air con as cool enough. I only had one neighbour and didn’t experience any noise. You can wash your clothes in the mini launderette with dryer and dry clean steamer.  Close to"
"Cool hotel Update design Perfect location  Location at 4 floor funan IT mall  - But no tv at room - No mineral water at room , u need go to lobby pick up water. - No everyday clean the room  Recommended try this hotel at singapore"
"We stayed here for 3 nights, on our way home to Finland from a resort vacation at Batam island. We wanted a well located, clean, affordable and functional accommodation. And we got all this! Thanks!  Lyf Funan is a modern choice, fresh and with friendly staff. We stayed in the one of a kind room which was exactly what it looked like in the pictures. But even more clean and fresh than we expected (after a terrible experience at the Sandpiper hotel).   We got three lovely days, doing all the touristy stuff. It was super easy to use the hop on hop off buses, with several stops near the lyf hotel. The City Hall MRT station just a short walk away. And easy access to the airport using the MRT green line.  Lyf Funan is within a shopping center with endless choices of food. No need for"
I love the location and the new funan mall itself.  This hotel is definitely geared towards millennials or travellers without kids.   We stayed in a two bedroom room with our toddler.  The view is nonexistent looking out a few meters to the next building.  But the real issue is the noise. It travels up from the ground floor and road so it sounds like our windows are always open.  There is people chatter noise from either the roof top or ground floor (can’t tell). And the real kicker was hacking / drilling sounds are midnight on one of our nights.  I assume it was from the mall next door and to be fair only happened on one of the nights. Thank goodness our kid is a heavy sleeper.    Lastly the bathroom didn’t have a fan.  So the warm humid air from the shower just lingers.
"We loved staying at Lyf. Conveniently located inside Funan Mall, si everything is literally at hand (once we went to the movie just two floors above) the rooms are clean and with all necessities, common room is cool and there is also a little are to work out! Also 5 minutes from subway and in a great area!"
the hotel is located in the Funan mall. Cozy and comfortable room and i like the design of the room. Small but very well designed. Just a few minute walk to the MRT station and there are a lot of choices of restaurant in the mall as well.
"This hotel offers an apartment up to 4 rooms co-sharing concept. Well, honestly I don’t really get it. For us traveling on big groups we are very happy that the property offers 4 bedrooms apartments able to host 7 of us family traveling in one location. We Indonesians, love that!! Yet they don’t serve breakfast as part of the service, but they also provide complete kitchen utilities, so its good offer. They also offer hi-tech kind of living, such as fancy toilets and a huge screen but only projects what’s on your “android” phones. Kinda cool huh..but for me, this kind of set back, since me and my wife use Apple. A good LED screen with cable TV is what I was prefer, or place a smart TV is already savvy enough for me, if you know what I mean. Yet, in overall, yes, we love that"
"Fair sized room, but no amenities. If you check their housekeeping policy - it's one service every seven days.  Checking in we paid for the three nights we had booked. But after seeing the room we went back to to the front desk to tell them the room was not suitable - bed located that so it was only accessible from one side - and we would be moving out the next day. Checking out the next day the clerk told us we had to give 24 hours notice. Told him we informed him yesterday checking out. Because the reservation was for three nights booked through booking.com we would need to contact them to get a refund. Told him I would contact the CC company and dispute the charge - got the full."
"Try to check in at around 12 noon and was asked to return at 3.00 pm but we can leave our luggage in their storage space. We have to store them ourselves no bell-boy or concierge to assist. They do provide us with lock.   Came back at around 3.30 pm, but our room is not yet ready as they have to check on something. We have to wait around 15 minutes. The staff sincerely apologize for this.  We booked ""one of a kind plus"" room. Our room feels smaller that what the photo shown at their website. But the design of the room is great. I can store my luggage and every day item with no problem. But the bathroom is different story, there is no separation on the shower, so the bathroom is always wet.   One thing I disliked staying here is that there is no real housekeeping during my 3"
"Love this place.  The location is awesome, the rooms are clean and comfortable.to.stay in. The place is also a good value.  I would most likely return if I ever go back to Singapore.   I love their kitchen (as a foodie and a cook this place is awesome) and their little work out area.   The location is great.  It's in a mall that is surrounded by food and tons of activities. Also this place is close to the MRT!"
"My wife and I stayed at lyf for 2 nights to celebrate two nights on our own before the baby comes. The staff were extremely patient and helpful with our requests. They showed a very high level of service, and I am especially grateful to Hafiz, Aloysius and Hayley. The room was nice and cosy, plenty of practical power point and USB locations. Enjoyed how soundproof the rooms are and getting a quick workout in at L6 BURN."
"We really wanted to try something new and fun instead of mainstream hotels here in Singapore. It was so worth it! This hotel/co-living space is located in Funan Mall which has all sorts of shops and restaurants and is within the central business district. The interior is playful, modern and functional.   I don‘t really get how people give bad ratings only because there is no tv or much space... there are so many things to explore and if someone wants a bigger room - read the information before booking or pay for it. We had much space and all in all a clean and neat room. Hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, water heater - all there. Service was as well amazing and very hospitable! They helped us in every possible way. Even got us a wheel chair for my injured boyfriend.  There is no"
"Located in the renovated Funan Mall, this is entry level offering from Ascot is great value for Singapore. The room is functional and convenient. There are two downsides, both to do with curtains. The window curtain needs remote operation as it is difficult to climb on the bed every time. A net curtain would make sense too given the close proximity of the other buildings. The absence of a shower curtain in the bathroom meant the wonderful rain shower made the toilet wet."
"My stay was absolutely fabulous. The room was spacious, clean, and it truly felt like a home away from home. The location is amazing and to able to stay right smack in the middle of town, right above a shopping center AND MRT for such an affordable price is truly an unbeatable deal.  The staff on shift during my check-in were amazing too. Genenieve and Caleb were incredibly helpful and made themselves available should we had any questions whatsoever.  I would highly recommend lyf to anyone who chooses to come to Singapore for a holiday, or friends and couples who are looking for a great place for a staycay. Amazing staff, clean rooms, and a perfect location all at such an affordable price - it's really an incredible deal!"
"I stayed at Lyf for just 1 night in a One Of A Kind Studio and it’s already become my favorite go-to place for staycays. The facilities are amazing and the place just feels so homely and cozy. My stay was definitely made better by Genevieve and Caleb who were constantly on their feet and ensuring that we had everything we needed during our stay! Totally recommended if you’re looking for a warm, homely getaway."
"Stayed here for 3 days and 2 nights, the room was small but cosy, and a there was a lot more useable space than I would have expected from a 18sqm room, didn't really use much of the amenities provided (laundry room, kitchen, gym, etc) but the location was amazing, just 5 mins from a well-connected train station and a really cool shopping mall just downstairs.  The staff were really friendly and helpful as well, special thanks to Genevieve and Caleb for their assistance and help throughout our stay.  Will definitely come back again!"
"The ""Studio with Queen Bed - One of a Kind"" might be the greatest RIP-OFF in Singapore!!  It is a very good location on top of a very nice shopping mall, but that does not permit a ONE STAR hostel with ZERO STAR service to charge FOUR star prices for a microscopic room without amenities.  Much of what they do in pretense of giving a co-living experience is just plain stupid and hazardous.  Every travel website should remove this property until it makes badly needed changes.  This room does not even have television, Instead they give you some black metal piece of crap that they call a projection screen for your personal device and no practical arm to hold  that device.  To make matters worse they put a stupid advertising sticker on the screen,  I am a techie, but I do not take a"
Enjoyed my stay here. The co-working space is great. I enjoyed some of the quirkinesses of the place (this includes a human size hamster wheel instead of a treadmill)  Good service but missed having breakfast available there.
If u want to see a room you need to send them an email...thats what the front office girl told me ! She just lost three room nights of walk in rate.  Good luck guys especially for a new property in town !
"It's about co sharing whether cooking, working group or socialization which has a big communal open space at the reception. The hotel is conveniently located in a shopping mall which you name it, they have it whether café, foods, drinks or supermarkets. Also the guests can work out in next door tenant's gym and swimming pool using the hotel's limited passes. The room is clean, neat and tidy which one can have a good rest or sleep. The big monitor screen in the room is for group working or presentation and not a TV  Services were great which specially mention and applaud the staff; Judy Wong, JV Ngan, Norman Cross, Hayley, Caleb and Win. They were friendly, accommodating and served with passion and smiles. I did enjoy the eventful stay though it's more suitable for the"
"Lyf is great! Rooms are clean and neat, looks very nice too though a bit small. Location is really convenient, it is near Orchard, Chinatown and Clarke Quay. It is also located opposite Fort Canning Park. Because it is located in Funan itself, there is no lack of food options. However, my only complaint is, my room was located opposite the fire station. Therefore, throughout the night as the fire engine exited the station, it sounded its siren really loudly and the announcements in the fire station kept waking me up. My room was also next to the main road, and the traffic sounds were quite loud as well. There was also construction going on in the middle of the night across the road. Therefore i was really kept awake till 3 or 4am. However, my boyfriend had no problems sleeping"
"New hotel right in the city!  Love how convenient it is to get food, even at wee hours, due to the 24 hours joints nearby.  Room is comfortable and really clean. Love the comfy bed too.  Really enjoyed my stay!"
The hotel is located in the mall. Convenient to WeWork in Funan. Rooms are pod like but very neat. Staff is very friendly. There aren't any cardio equipment in the gym. Very comfortable stay. Mall has some shopping options. Cabs available outside the mall.
It's the perfect place to stay for a short visit to singapore. it's actually a service apartment. price is not that pricey. room is clean and convinient. The facility are great and staff are welcoming!
"The room was pretty cozy for 2. USB charging ports were very convenient. Using the phone as a key card was interesting, got the hang of it after a couple of times. Close to MRT and fort canning park and other places. Also has some pretty fun shared places. Had a very pleasant stay."
"The location is convenient located Funan mall, walking distance to nearby attractions. The ambience and concept of lyf is hype and lively. We do love the common sharing space. Yet the room is relatively smaller than expected."
Nice ambience and location. Well suited mainly for business and tourist people. The concept is really new which we had never seen elsewhere. The location is one of the major advantage. Overall excellent!!!! Highly recommended
The room was compact and cozy to stay. Experienced a very pleasant stay. Preferably couples and group of  friends will enjoy the stay there. Concept of no TV is a good and different idea. Thank you for the service.
"The basin is located inside the room instead of the toilet. It feels disgusting to sleep beside the basin.   Which hotel doesn't have TV? Only this hotel.   No hotel card is given. You need to access the lift and room use an app. The app uses Bluetooth to activate the lift and unlock the room. We entered the lift and it took awhile to get the app working. By then, the lift has moved to another floor.   They think it's designed for millennials. But the titles in the toilet looks ugly. Come on. It looks like a 1960s toilet."
"It was the most hype hotel ever, was truly an amazing stay. As a fitness enthusiastic I always prefer having a gym in the hotel, but this hotel provide more then that, from kicking pads to trx, kettle bell, yoga mat all different kinds of equipment and open space making training more fun! their lobby include a giant 4 in a row, selfie machine that sent pictures into your email! And there is even water vending machine just at the end of the walkway.  To summarize it, this hotel really give us a very comfortable feeling and most of the things is very accessible from food to movie all can be found in this building! Awesome job Lyf! Keep up the good work!"
"Place was very aesthetic- you cant find a corner that isnt insta-worthy!!! The staff were extremely friendly and helpful too. Stayed in the loft and it was such a lovely n comfortable stay. Conducive to study too, with friends. Will definitely come back!!!"
A comfortable place to have a good time with friends. Very convenient place with many awesome facilities such as a ball pit. They even have a water filter. Also a very conducive place to study. Will definitely come back again!!!
"The lobby is fun-filled with games, a ball pit and even a gif booth. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly and personally, I really love the co-living space where we can connect with new individuals or get some work done!"
Excellent service with really friendly staff. Place was amazing and would really go back there again!!! My friends and i would want to create new memories especially since it’s really near our school.
"Stayed in the 6 bedroom apartment for a few days. Entire place had a very fresh concept and design! There was something interesting at every other corner. Staff attended to all my needs and took feedback very seriously. The apartment has every other necessity you would need and anything else, you can easily get from the mall. Great location and greater place, will definitely come back!"
"The stay was amazing. I stayed in the loft for 4 days and enjoyed every moment there – from the decor to the comfort level and amenities, everything was provided by for us. Honestly a very pleasant stay."
I stayed in the 2 level loft which consisted of 6 bedrooms in total!! The entire place was so clean and cosy and really affordable!! The lyf staff are super friendly and tended to every need!! The entire place is so colorful and youthful and there’s food in the mall itself so it’s a super great location!! I would definitely recommend you to stay here in the future because I will absolutely return again!!!
"We were greeted by friendly Lyf guard, Wilfred at the counter who explained to us on the latest update of the app facility we needed to log into. It was totally a new experience for me whereby we just needed to use our mobile phone to connect to the lift and the entrance to the room. Very much a self-service residential concept. The room is enough to occupy 2 people, the bed was comfortable and everything was simply fabulous. The lobby calls for residence to mingle with other guests in a very friendly set-up of bursting colours and modern living. Thank you for making our stay comfortable.  What I like most about the place is, it is located in the Funan Mall. It is easy to just roam around the mall to look for food, shopping and even watch a movie. All under one roof."
"Hostel like hotel.  Compact, clean and cosy room. But toilet always wet cos cannot block shower water splash  No TV, no refrigerator, no bottle drink in room. Outside got refrigerator can share but put yr fd at yr own risk. Bottle drink can go downstairs buy got many shop. No TV, use handphone play until sleep.   Toothbrush, shaver, comb need ask counter  No housekeeping if short stay. Go counter ask for new towel and tissue paper  Look like got many long term people stay. Can see people cook and wash clothes like their own house."
"Download the Lyf by Ascott app. Login with your details. Input your reservation number if you make bookings from other sites. Then link to your account. On your location and Bluetooth, to tap at the lift to press your hotel room floor, as well as to your room.   Drop-off point is opposite fire station. Entrance is at MacDonald door, take the lift up to level 4, to the hotel reception.   Parking is not free. One time ticket is $17. Meaning to say if you exit, the car park ticket would be gone. The car park rate is 1st 2 hours for $2.35 on weekends, $0.65 for the next 15 minutes. The car park is super hard to find a parking lot. Not advisable to drive there on weekends as there are continuous flow or cars going into the car park. The car park road are very narrow too.   The hotel"
"Needed a place for a staycation for a group of 6 and this was perfect! We had our own spaces (4 bedrooms), enough toilets, and a shared dining area with a kitchenette if we wanted to mingle. Loved it and would come again."
"Checked into the small room at level 6, room wasn't sound proof, thin walls, faulty electric kettle. Feedback this to Mr Jay Vincent (manager) who happened to be around the front desk. He was very approachable and listen patiently to our feedback and was open to the idea of upgrading our room.
