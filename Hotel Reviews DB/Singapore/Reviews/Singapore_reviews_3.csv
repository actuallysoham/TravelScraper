very small room with no privacy because you can look inside of the room from the streets. don't bother trying to email them because they probably won't want to entertain you. just find this chinese guy at the front desk. he is there in the afternoon and night. he is funny and good so don't email.
Anyone who wants to experience true downtown Singapore culture should check out this stylish hotel! Best location to stay with so much international F&B choices at Mohamad Sultan and Clarke Quay you are spoilt for choice. Superb front office service and so accommodating! I couldn't ask for more for a staycation and personal retreat with a smashing view through the ceiling-to-floor full wall glass at the Deluxe Room!
"Location is great. Plenty of food options. Walking distance to Clarke quay. Room is a bit small, more of business hotel. Room is clean. Will be good if complimentary parking can be provided. Andy at front desk is friendly and very helpful. Brightens our stay."
The location was great and the price was worth as I had booked the 1 for one 1 promo. I had overall enjoyed my stay. The booking for the swimming pool and gym was very convenient and the service was great. I did not enjoy my dinner at Porta but I only tried one food item so it might be a one-off. Overall it was a good experience.
Experience is great. But the exposed wires of lighting by the pool need to be fixed. Left the pool with my kids after spotting the exposed wiring. Rooms are nice and clean. Children had fun for this staycation trip.
"Overall stay was pleasant. Andy‚Äôs promptness and friendless has make the trip more heartwarming. Hospitality was there except the bath room towel part where I tried calling the housekeeping side, where the person says I can‚Äôt change towel because I‚Äôm only staying one night and I had to explain why I needed to change the bathroom towel."
"We did a short staycation in April for 2 days, it was amazing experience we got access to Crystal club lounge for evening drink, the Hotel staff was so friendly and Ms Gain at front-desk and Anglina at the Lounge was very helpful always with a smile   Over all Great Experience and I cant compliment enough for the dinning experience @    PORTA the food and service will too good. Ms Tracy @ Porta suggest some nice main and dessert and made us feel home. Thanks a lot Tracy   we will love to visit @PORTA again for sure   PS: The Black forest cake , Grilled Octopus and the Spanish Pork chop is the best ever we had Honestly ...Look for Ms Tracy if you are @ PORTA ...she will make you feel home and suggest  food   to fit you taste and you u will enjoy.  All in All the Best Staycation"
"Used my SRV vouchers for a staycay as a get-together with my bros, and I'm glad to have made PHCQ my choice of accommodation.  Hotel is situated 5 minutes away from Fort Canning MRT and has 7-11 and Cold Storage just across the road for groceries. Room was equipped with a TV that fortunately allowed screen mirroring with my Samsung S8 and Aftershock laptop for Netflix movies. A Covid19 care pack was also included in the room for those that require face masks, wet wipes and hand sanitiser.  Special thanks to Duty Manager Jason for his assitance before and during my 13-14 April stay in #806."
"Hotel cleaner staff just barge into our room without knocking on our door or informing us leaving us in shock. She came in and just say ""oh check in already ah."" It would be nice if she knock in advance as we need some privacy in our own hotel room .  Thanks"
"Shocked to hear that parking at the hotel was not free as when we made the booking 2 months before, we were informed that parking was free. Was informed by receptionist that our rooms were upgraded but the room size seems like a standard room. Bed was small for our liking for an ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù room. Poor service at Porta for breakfast. High point is the locality of the property."
"Good üëçService good, cleanliness, hygiene of respectable standard, good view of nostalgic Singapore River and the surrounding financial district. Room size not what is expected...food available typical European"
Cheap and centrally located with a supermarket within walking distance of 2mins. Bus stop nearby so can get to other places easily. Drinking places within walking distance. Overall experience is consider good.
"Booked this hotel from Klook to have a staycation with my friend for my birthday. It started with Anna from reservations, she is one of the most meticulous staff from reservations that I've encountered. I emailed to check with the hotel if I could get an early check-in and late check-out for my stay as I'd like to use the hotel facilities. She told me that although requests are upon availability, she assured me that she'd put up my requests. Also she asked if I was celebrating anything, and when I mentioned my birthday, she also noted it down in my booking. Lastly, she checked with me if I had any room preferences (which I didn't). I mean, she's really meticulous!  Upon my arrival on the day, I arrived at 11.30am after I checking-out from another hotel, and headed to PHCQ, we"
"A clean and average hotel near the Singapore River Clarke Quay area. The check in and check out were smooth and efficient. However, limited breakfast varieties and each guest only limited to pick one choice from the breakfast menu."
"Staff is generally friendly. Place is clean. Personally, I like the swimming pool a lot as it is really nice and considered spacious. Will come back for another trip again. Definitely value for the money!"
"Counter service was good, check in and out was prompt and fast.Porta Restaurant staff service was good. Keep it up. Enjoy the staycation here as the atmosphere is peaceful and tranquail. Swimming pool very well maintained."
"Staff were friendly and efficient. Fuss-free check in and check out experience. The rooms were clean. Generally convenient location with restaurants, cafes and 7-eleven located just within walking distance of the hotel"
Overall a welcoming and comfortable experience with the establishment located at a suitable location for a weekend break. Not too far away from amenities and great options for a morning/evening walk/jog by the river or Fort Canning Park
"We were contemplating of taking a Staycation for few months now, and we‚Äôre looking at a hotel with great location and friendly staff.   Post some initial due diligence and also after going through reviews online, we zeroed in on Park Hotel Clark Quay.   We are so glad that we took this decision as the hotel indeed is brilliantly located which helped us to reach rapidly to places like MBS, Kiztopia (we have tiny kids) and Botanical Gardens. The hotel is located right next to Clark Quay, Fort Canning MRT and Fort Canning Park. Plenty of options for food/restaurants at the Clark Quay.  We booked an Executive Suite which is really spacious and came with great views.  The best part of the stay was the extremely supportive and friendly staff. While everyone in the team is great, would"
overall a pleasant with excellent care and service from the staff. advise not to drive as the carpark has very limited parking lots. rooms are cozy and clean. did not try the restaurants there but it has a nice ambience inside.
"Good Location, affordable price. the lady staff at check in counter is friendly.  Hotel breakfast at Porta is nice too, serving a bit slow, but acceptable.  I like the swimming pool.  I hope hotel can provide more carpark slots for guests."
The check in counter was fast to look into our room. One uniform staff happened to be in the lift showed us how to slot in and out the room card to go up to our level. I would say the staffs we encountered were very helpful
"Good Location. The food is expensive.Seems like some small rooms, 4 to 5 pax staying together as It is covid 19 time. Good service when check out but not upon check in. Swimming pool view is nice.Toilet is clean"
"Staff were really warm and helpful! Service was efficient and fast. Was with a baby and stroller and there was a long queue for check-in at the lobby. Led us up for check-in at club lounge instead! Room is rather small but nice, clean and cosy. Requested for iron, ironing board and baby cot too and they were quick to respond and provide for us. Our room was at level 2 and it was really convenient and near to the swimming pool. Overall a great stay!"
"Professional staff that handles check-in well. Pleasant and accommodating. Was given rooms with beautiful riverfront view! Rooms are generally clean and of standard size... however,it's further away from main shopping centers but if you love bars and alfresco, Clarke Quay is nearby!"
Celebrating 20yrs wedding anniversary there. Ms Gian who serves us upon checked in gave us af free upgrade to Deluxe rm with a river view. She also gave us a free gift. Thanks Gian and Park Hotel..üëçüëç
Comfortable. Love this hotel for its location - busy around the hotel in evenings but sound was filtered out. Great for walks along the Singapore River all the way down to MBS.  Fort Canning Park nearby for another view of the Quay.
Its a enjoyable staycation for us. The check in staff is very friendly and cheerful. House keeping lady is also very caring and warm. Overall experience is very pleasant. Will recommend and for sure visit again.
Hotel was ideal for a short stay and is close to Fort Canning MRT. Friendly check-in staff and thorough temperature checks on each entry to the hotel. Rooms are clean and there's 24 hours WIFI. Would recommend friends to add to their list for consideration.
"Great service fast check in and check out. Staff were friendly and attentive. Breakfast included in meal was great however only get to select one, would be good if there were some fruits included in the breakfast. Loved the pool it was really relaxing to soak in the tub and had a wonderful time there!"
"Good staff service! Especially Andy. He have a great service and good attitude! Toilet abit small, but overall is acceptable! Love the hotel staff service! Is superb convenient to nearby restaurants as well."
Went for staycation and stayed for 2 nights. Room was clean and surrounding have a lot of restaurants. We took a walk along the river and was nice to had brunch with river view. Can‚Äôt believe I am in the city but yet having peacefully nice river view there.
Went for a staycation trip with my friends. It was long since i had a staycation. We were greeted welcomingly by Jason who was very patient with us as we were confused and had concerns. We then checked in our rooms and the mini fridge was not very cold and one of my slippers was torn.   Overall it is a very pleasant stay for us and we enjoyed it alot. Special mention to yuta from the room service who was very friendly and welcoming.   Definitely would come back again.
"Great location. Cafes, supermarket, restaurants are within walking distance. Near Fort Canning Mrt.  Nice sunset walk and stroll too. Value for money. Got upgraded to a deluxe room to my surprise as my reservation was a superior room only."
Very thankful for the complimentary room upgrade. Overall the stay was okay however the poor sound proofing affected our sleeping./napping. Facilities was very limited also. But food quality and room service was great except for the arrival which had a little delay.
"It was just a one night stay, but we had a really good time. The hotel staffs were very friendly and helpful. Check in and check out was a breeze. The room is very clean, cosy and quiet. Bed and pillows are very comfortable too. The pool and gym are very clean and easy to book the slot to use both facilities. We specifically love the pool so much. This hotel also located near Fort Canning mrt station and there is a bus stop nearby which is very convenient for us too. We truly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this hotel."
I booked for connecting rooms and liaise with reservation department about my humble request and the team reply to me promptly. I had a great stay with Park Hotel Clarke Quay. My kids enjoy the pool and room service care for the guest.
"In the midst of Covid-19 where travel for holidays are not allowed, the best to have a short getaway is to find a nice place for staycation. Upon arriving the hotel, greeted by front counter staff and checked in is smoothly done. Had the room upgraded by the friendly staff. The view is nice. The room is clean. Price is reasonable for its convenient location where so many good restaurants and cafe around.  The only disappointment is no one answer my room service call for breakfast. Did an early check out to hunt for food."
"The room was comfortable and cozy and the hotel service exceeded my expectations. It was near the Singapore river, so it was nice to take a walk after my dinner.  Would definitely come back again and recommend it to others."
Nestled along the river. A stone's throw from Clarke quay. Great surrounding ambience.  Nice walk along the river.  No lack of food. Quiet and clean hotel.  Nearest Mrt is Fort Canning MRT.   Room is not big but still can snug in a 3rd bed.  Friendly staff.
Overall experience is good. Appreciate the team taking effort to get a connecting room for us. Location is convenient and many eatery  nearby. I like the pool as it is bigger than my expectation. Will definitely book again
"Very good, asked for birthday privilege and was upgraded to a higher tier room with a bathtub which was nice:) there was this slight sound from the aircon at night which make it a bit of trouble to sleep. Bed was very comfortable"
Service is good and the room is comfortable despite finding that the bathrobe condition is not satisfactory upon arrival. The cleanliness of the room does make up for the slight flaw. Hope the housekeeping team can take note of the small details. It was a good staycation for me still
"Smooth check in, and departures. Room and toilet is spacious, though pillows could be a better quality ones.  Breakfast at Porta is  not so nice. Overall a pleasant stay. Would give a come back in future."
Went with my parents and family and it was a pleasant experience for us. The services are good and rooms are clean.   We went to the pool every day during our stay and it has a large and great pool. Although the Netflix in my room always get disconnected but it isn‚Äôt a big issue. My parents got to enjoy the Netflix at the comfort in their room when they had nothing to do.   However the carpark lots are very limited like less than 20 but I was lucky to get a lot every time.   Location is excellent as eateries and shopping malls are very nearby.
"The room nice, view also good. The Andy guys also nice and helpful people. But the room quite small if can be bigger will be best, find some place to go have a bit far and some place to buy foods also have far."
The location was very convenient to many places especially food! The room was well liked! The service was excellent! The international breakfast was up to my liking! Hope I stay there again next time!
Great and wonderful experience. All my requests were met. Would really love to try and stay at Park Hotel at Alexandra for my 37th birthday on 5th April if you can offer complimentary breakfast for 2.
"Seamless check in system, great location. Restaurants and bars literally just downstairs. There‚Äôs parking too.  Efficient service. We enjoyed it a lot that one night wasn‚Äôt enough, so extended an extra night. Highly recommend and would come back again."
"We had a wonderful time in the hotel, thanks for accepting our request for early check in at 9am. Hotel staff was also very kind in giving us connecting rooms as we were 5 of us. The ambience at the swimming pool area is quite nice and we took lot of pictures there. Both check in and check out was a seamless experience, not to forget free car parking available in the hotel. Nice place to walk around in the evening and lot of choices for food.. We had our lunch at Porta restaurant and the waitress Miss. Tracy  was very friendly, and gave us good recommendation for my mom's food choice. We were moved by her wonderful service."
"It was a pleasant and enjoyable stay. The swimming was clean and big. Loving the location, next to Robertson Quay  and there 7 eleven nearby.  A great place for family and friends. We will definitely will be back."
Small portion for the breakfast and limited choices ... waited breakfast for long as well.. the room was clean and facilities was okay. Will recomend to opt out for breakdast since there are good breakfast at nearby cafes
"Overall I was very pleased with the stay, I was able to do what was intended, thank you for the staff‚Äôs service, it was friendly n helpful. I will recommend friends to this hotel, and I will book this hotel again if I need to relax."
"Overall park hotel clarke quay is pretty good. They have swimming pool, gym and even meeting rooms and breakfast. I would highly recommend my friends and family to stay in this hotel for either business or staycation."
"There are lots of food choices nearby, UE Square, Robertson Quay and Clarke Quay. Checking in and out was easy. The counter Manager was really friendly, thumbs up for his service! Will definitely stay again if there is promotion."
"Pleased with our 3D 2N stay here. Checking-in and out was a breeze. Staff were friendly. Clean and cozy rooms. Just a note to Muslim guests that there were no bidet attached in the room toilets and no Halal kitchen in the hotel.  Nonetheless, there is a coffee shop nearby selling Indian food.  Great location with nearby MRT station (Fort Canning)."
Location is great for us; We have been taking public transport travel around the island. It is a great place to workout .. example outdoor walking around the hotel. We walk to Boat Quay Clarke quay and even walk all the walk to MBS for a dinner and visit the Apple shop.
"Staff is well trained and polite. Room is clean and room keeper is friendly. However was disappointed with the breakfast, quite troublesome to select prior for it and not worth for the price paid. Quantity is lesser than expected."
"Accesible to Clark Quay, Boat Quay and Robertson Quay with its many food and drinking establishments; Nice for night walks, although pavement areas could have been better in some segments. easy for local to navigate but tourists may need some help"
"A stay to celebrate my birthday.  Stayed at the Crystal Premier Room.  The view of Singapore river and CBD skyline is just spectacular! Staff are friendly and helpful.  Special mention to Angeline who is friendly and forthcoming and first grade customer service.  Also Gian who is also very helpful, took notice of my birthday and congratulated me.  Overall a splendid experience.  If want to have a memorable stay, choose the Crystal Premier Room. Evening walk along the SIngapore river is nice with plenty of eateries.  Vibrant and feels like holiday (though is a staycation)"
"Location was very accessible and convenient. fort canning MRT is nearby and very close walking distance to Clarke quay as well. However, there is construction going on near the hotel and was able to hear faint drilling noises. Had to keep the tv on to drain out the construction sound. One downside is that my family & I booked 2 rooms and they were nice enough to give side by side. But one of the room‚Äôs toilet cannot lock. Staff should have checked before letting it out. Didn‚Äôt change rooms and it was only a one night staycay and won‚Äôt do much damage to us."
"The hotel location is convenient where it sits right smack in the middle of downtown. It is near to amenities such as restaurants, shopping mall and a public park. If you like the river view, this is one of the better choices to stay where the hotel overlooks the Singapore River."
"Went for family staycation during March. Rooms were pleasant and facilities was all okay. What was disappointing was the service standard in Porta. The waiter and manager was no proactive enough, seems like they were not interested to serve us. Food was horrible too"
"I originally booked the deluxe room and was pleasantly surprised when I got upgraded upon check-in. The hotel location and price was very attractive. The view out from my window at night was superb and one I will not forget. The only downside was the mini fridge was not cold enough, and the ice cream intended for dessert after dinner was all melted when we tried to consume it. Overall we had a good stay and will definitely recommend Park Hotel as a staycation destination to our friends and family."
This is on the whole a pleasant hotel with pleasant staff except for the faulty aircon that we had in our room. The room we had had a nice view of the pool and cleanliness was decent. Pillows could be fluffier and the fridge could be colder. A bidet for the toilet would be great too. But we were most bothered by the aircon that was faulty. The breakfast was also expensive as they no longer serve a la carte buffet. One dish for $20 is not cheap! We could have gotten better meals outside.
Great stay. Service was excellent. Check in & check out were very smooth. Would love to stay again. Would also recommend to family & friends. Great location. Plenty of restaurants nearby to choose from. üëç
Very nice hotel tucked away in a quiet area of Clarke Quay. Very smooth check in process and was in my room within 10 minutes.   Hotel staffs were very welcoming and polite. Also very prompt to respond to any queries i had.  Enjoyed the stay! Will be back!
"Had a 3d2n stay with the hotel. Nothing to complain about, service was excellent and housekeeping was quick to address any concerns or requirements. Compliments to Nick who checked us in and also served us evening cocktails at Porta as part of club benefits. He was warm and polite even though he was busy and provided exceptional service. Good location with plenty of good dining options around, recommended for a nice reset from work."
"Had a wonderful sleep on their mattress! Loads of eateries nearby, clean rooms, very good and dedicated staff! Food at Porta was awesome! Complimentary parking was a plus point. Overall, it was a good staycation for us and we would love to come back again! All the staff we met were nice and polite!"
"The pillows are not comfortable, there‚Äôs no bath mat provided, no Nespresso coffee machine, no Bluetooth speakers.  Even the television channels are not interesting.  The rooms need refurbishment.  They even left out the bath mat!  Is this hotel even safety conscious?"
"Very good and warm friendly check in and services rendered during my stay.  Kudos to Susan, Joe, Andy, Gian, Sugen (morning) n Arafyat (night). Sorry if I spell any of your names wrongly.  Highly recommend to all Singaporeans looking for a good hotel service for staycation.   Keep up the good work and thank you for making my one-night-stay a beautiful memory for my birthday 15 March 2021 !!!! God bless everyone!"
"Nice classic and cosy hotel and pool with easy access to riverside food and entertainment places. Very friendly staff. Thanks in particular to Mr Andy for his superb and stellar service to ensure our needs and comfort.. with early check-in, late checkout, lovely view room, complimentary drinks at Porta, beautiful tot bags and bottled water for our walk around. Thank you so much!"
The front office agent was very friendly and patient even though there were many arrivals. Breakfast was served long as there were shortage of manpower in the kitchen. However the staffs were very friendly and courteous.
The staff Andy was very nice he know that is my birthday he initiantive upgrade our room to deluxe with river view and bathtub. The room are also very nice and clean. The hotel price is reasonable will plan again for my next trip.
"The stay we had was enjoyable. The rooms were generally clean, apart from some stains on the bedsheet and pillow cases. Not a big deal as a quick call for housekeeping resolved this issue rather quickly. The best part of this stay had to be the pool. It was huge (by hotel standards) and suitable for lap swimming. The pool area was also pretty. Loved those pillars around the pool. I think they are Roman inspired. Really contributes to the aesthetics of the place.  However, not everything was perfect about the stay. The most glaring negative was the breakfast. Each guest was entitled to only one set. Absolutely no refills apart from drinks were allowed. This came as a surprise to me. There wasn‚Äôt even a break basket, fruit or yoghurt. The egg set I had was miserable looking. To"
"We booked a one night staycation on 27th Feb and was greeted by very friendly Duty Manager, Andy!  Not only the check in was smooth but he ensured our requests were met.  Will definitely come back again with our family & friends.  Great customer service Andy and Keep up that positive vibes üòä"
"Warm and friendly staff. Great views and plenty of F&B options. Pool is big enough for 3-5 serious swimmers and play area for kids. Shower pressure is powerful but if your neighbours are having 7am showers, it can be quite a wakeup call."
- staffs were very nice and patient  - room was comfortable and nice to stay in - overall a very good experience   hotel was relatively near to funan mall & the central clarke quay which was great (:    recommended!!
"Booked for 2 nights as I had a wedding nearby. Service was good. Check in was fast despite a queue, staff apologized for the wait. Not much to eat around the area but room was nice and clean. WiFi wasn‚Äôt that good."
Swimming pool is big with jacuzzi for budget price. Good location - food and convenience store just opposite. Walking distance to Fort Canning MRT. Room a bit small but this is what you get at this price.
The location is good so we could explore nearby attractions within walking distance. The room is super clean and the bed is super cozy. The gym and pool are clean too. Netflix had us entertained during our stay here. We didn't try the food here as we were out most of the time.
"Well maintained hotel, the staff are friendly. Properly due to Covid and not a peak season, the place is quiet and able to enjoy the facilities without any problem booking. Nearby pubs & restaurant will be able to keep you busy."
A comfortable and cosy family stay at a service oriented hotel. Good food and one definitely not to be missed. Would recommend this hotel and come back for future stay to enjoy the facilities or dining.
"I did a staycation at Park Hotel with my husband. This hotel is the best choice compared to the hotels in its vicinity. It is well-connected and economical. Though the building is aged, it doesn‚Äôt looked like it. Hotel room, bathroom, swimming pool and restaurants were maintained. Service staff Joe and Andy were friendly, calls were attended to. :)"
"really a last minute things , but the manager duty, Andy rly helps me alot w everything. he gave me alot of suggestions as i was out of ideas. thank you so much to Andy and the staffs cos you guys rly make it happen!! you guys make it rly special for the bday man!  everyone thr really friendly. love to see all the staffs smile!! would rly love to come again anytime soon!"
"Great memorable and service by Andy really fantastic thanks to him. surprise us with the beautiful Swan towels on bed, very satisfied with all the upgrade and clean room.Good job! We enjoyed the stay."
"Would have spent money on a better hotel. Rooms looked totally different from photos. Breakfast wasn‚Äôt great. One of the receptionist was really unfriendly, he didn‚Äôt help with my issue at all. Parking lots limited especially on weekends when there are weddings."
Horrible and Terrible Stay with a beyond expected experience with the customer service at front desk. First and very first time encountering such unreasonable and non logic issue. All that i need  to put on awareness to public was indicated on hotel feedback and review webpage.
Enjoyed our stay. It was our Anniversary Staycation because we can‚Äôt travel out of SG. Glad we chose Park Hotel Clark Quay for our stay. Thank you to all the staff who are doing a great job and for keeping this place alive and welcoming to your guests. Cheers
"The room are not bad but I am truly disappointed because there was no BIGET at all inside the bathroom. Even more disappointment when called the reception the staff sounded 'couldn't care' n said that all rooms are not equipped with budget inside the toilets. With covid-19 pandemic Park Hotel Clark Quay don't seem to realise how important it is to have one' backside to be washed clean than to just using soap. Of course the management can always reasoned that it can be done inside the shower but really??? How inconvenient and unhygienic to wash your filty backside inside a shower. BIGET is the most practical, convenient and hygienic way to wash your backside inside a toilet bowl before it being flushed. Simple common sense but yet never put it as the most important priority."
"Great location, clean rooms and friendly and helpful staffs. Love my first experience! Will recommend this hotel to my friends and will certainly consider coming back for a weekend staycation. Thank You to all at Park Hotel, Clarke Quay."
"Fantastic stay. Check-in and out was done seamlessly. Front Desk Personnels were polite, cheerful and helpful. Room was spacious (even though it was a Superior Room) and clean. Would definitely consider coming back for a stay if possible."
"Superb - got checked in in a flash, free upgrade, and room was everything we wanted. Staff went above beyond to help, like loaning chargers. Smart TV had convenient Netflix and YouTube. Too bad didn‚Äôt have time to visit the pool, definitely coming again"
"We enjoyed our two nights stay in Park Hotel Clarke Quay.  The Hotel is clean and well maintained. Location is good , very accessible . Nice for night strolling along the river, Perfect for morning jog.  Staff is all very friendly and courteous.  Food at Porta was delicious.   Overall rating is Thumbs UP:) Thank you Park Hotel."
Had an enjoyable 2d1n babymoon staycation at this hotel. The location is very convenient as it is walking distance to The Central mall with Don Don Donki to buy your snacks and groceries.Lots of restaurants along Boat Quay and Robertson Quay which are all within walking distance as well. Hotel staff Gian offered early check in as well as late check out for us which we really appreciate the kind gesture. She also arranged for a high floor room with pool view. Thank you Gian!
