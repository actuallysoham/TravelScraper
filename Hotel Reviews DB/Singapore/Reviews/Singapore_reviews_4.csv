"1N stay-cay only, at the Valley Wing  Pros 1. Generous sized room and bathroom 2. Quiet surrounds, the heart of the city 3. Lovely complimentary chocolate cake for my bday 4. Great service, after what's been a really hard year for the industry  Cons 1. Building, and architecture, does show its age 2. Packed with families with very young children, like mine 3. Probably need a car to get everywhere else  All in, I would try another Shangri Hotel next time, say Rasa Sentosa or Hotel Jen/Traders"
"We stayed in the Sangri-la Orange Grove garden wing, two kids below 12 and two of us, typical tired parents in need of a holiday.  Our experience started at check in. smooth and without any delays, it was so helpful. Thanks to Ms Adian we had a warm welcome and kids felt at home. She supported all our questions and asks during the duration of our stay and we are grateful for her professionalism, friendliness and commitment to the highest standard of care in the hospitality industry we have come across.   All staff were brilliant and very helpful and it made our stay beyond our expectations. Wherever we went, Buds, Splash, poolside bar, Grill, Valley Wing lounge, Valley wing breakfast or lobby lounge, we received service with a smile. The kids did not want to leave.  We will come"
"We stayed at the Valley Wing last December. We enjoyed the food and drink offerings quite a bit; our child enjoyed buds and the Splash Zone very much.  Having done a number of other staycations in Singaporean hotels during this pandemic period, we are rather impressed by the overall efficiency of the hotel in handling check-ins and avoiding the nightmare queues that seem to plague some other properties.  In particular, I would like to express my gratitude to the excellent service offered by Mr Samuel Dhanraj, who had noticed that we were getting ready to leave the hotel rather early (for my child's afternoon nap). He generously granted us a late check-out so we did not have to do so, and we were able to enjoy our stay for a number of additional hours.  We plan to return rather"
"I stayed at Shangri La last weekend to celebrate a special occasion with my family. Being a fellow hotelier, I was taken away by the service given by the staff.   Adian was so helpful in helping me with my booking & enquiries, Kaylee was fast and efficient with the billing upon check out. Hafiz promptly assisted me and family with our bags upon check out as we still wanted to get some coffee and walk around for a bit. Vijay then assisted with our bags and sent us off in our Grab with us feeling bittersweet - happy that the stay was great but sad that our dreamy staycation had ended.   The room was spacious, with a great view overlooking the pool and the calming sound of the waterfall next to our room. Perfect for having a night cup of coffee in the balcony with such a great"
"Went for a staycay in Nov 2020 on a family package. The hotel is huge and grand, and crowded as it was the school holiday period. They couldn't give us a room so they gave us 2 complimentary drinks. However, to redeem that 2 drinks, we had to make booking for a table at the cafe, and sort of were ""hinted"" to vacate soon.   Our room was at Garden Wing, with the balcony looking over the main road. Room was a bit aged, but it was fine. The lifts were always busy and crowded. Moving around the hotel was not too straight forward with a pram, such as going to the restaurant on the 2nd floor, or the breakfast next to the pool. The splash area was great for the kids, and the walk on the lawn was refreshing. Due to safe management measures, breakfast was ordered through the phone which"
Awesome staycation. Room was very clean and spacious with friendly staff both check in and out. huge balcony!!! Highlights was the buds waterpark for the kids and top it off with seafood and/or int'l meat buffet at The Line Restaurant...definitely recommend for family with kids.
"Dear Shangri-La,  I would like to give my highest of compliments to your excellent team that took care of me during my stay on 16th February. It was a very special day for me as it was the day I proposed to my future wife. I am glad I made the right choice of choosing Shangri-La for my occasion. Firstly, I would like to personally thank Yana Arshad and her fantastic team from Guest Relation who went far beyond the extra mile to ensure that this day will be a perfect one for me. She arranged a romantic set-up during check-in for us to begin with a great start. She coordinated well with me to have our friends come and setup the surprise during dinner. To end it all, she pre-ordered a cake that came in just in time for us to celebrate this joyful day.   I would also like to thank a"
We had initially wanted to book Shangri-La Sentosa but we are glad that we eventually chose Shangri-La Orchard as we had really enjoyed our stay with you guys.   Room was spacious with a private garden. Jacqueline assisted us with check in. She was very professional and the whole process was seamless. She kept us engage throughout the whole check in process and gave us a detailed explanation on the hotel facilities.  Special thanks to Jack for arranging the surprise for me and my partner and we really appreciate it.   We will come back again.
"Despite full occupancy (stayed 2nd to 5th April, Room 858) svc staff at summit room (flowrence, sharmila, Janga n team of part timers) managed to get things n food n drinks flowing. N take note of guests too.   Housekeeping also good despite busy schedules. Kudos to Sam, Valley wing manager for running tight ship.   N yes, thank you for acknowledgement that there will be no repeat of guests waiting up to 3hrs for rooms to be available for use upon 3pm check-in."
"Stayed at the Valley Wing! Worth the investment üòä also took the family fun package. What can i say, we are so busy with a lot of fun activities plus we get to eat a lot as well! I find the breakfast at line just ok but nonetheless we really enjoyed this stay and got some cake and balloons to celebrate my son's birthday."
"Although the stay was a short 1,we are glad to have spent our time there..the kids were most delighted with the outdoor activities and the staff were always around to assist us...Kudos to all and hope more will visit once the borders are open to enjoy like we did..üëçüëçüëç"
"My wife and I took this staycation to celebrate our anniversary and was delighted with the lovely chocolate ice cream cake you surprised us with . We chose the Shangri La Becos it offered a quiet self contained sanctuary among the hustle and bustle of Orchard road - the rejuvenation was magical in a covid19 stricken environment . The facilities the ambience the Origin grill - were fantastic . And of course the great hospitality made our stay an unforgettable one . A special Shout Out to young Master Nicholas at the check-in who was professional , helpful and sincere - give this young handsome chap a raise ! Well done Shangri La - u have a life long supporter ."
"What a fab experience! I'm super impressed! From check in to check out, everything was just peeeerrrfect ! The room was all done and decorated with flowers, cake, chocolates, fruits as we were celebrating a special occasion..Special mention of Jeghan from the valley wing summit for making us feel extra special and making super drinks for us. He surely is an asset! Also Ling Ling from the Line restaurant who took great care of our son and us during breakfast. Went out of the way to order stuff for us. She is truly a star ! The origin grill restaurant was fab and the gentleman there ordered a super customized dish for us. The buds is just simply awesome and my son loved it ! Great getaway within the city !! We will be back soon !"
"Just completed a staycation at the Garden Wing. The only positive comments I have about the hotel is the  grand lobby, the generous size of the room and the lush greenery.  Room was not ready when we checked in at 3.00. Only got our key to the room at around 4.15pm.  Unable to give us a late check out to compensate for the delaycheck in.  In my view, this is not the service one expects from a brand like the shangrila.  Room was a bit dated but that‚Äôs OK as room was reasonably clean. However the kettle in the room did not switch off by itself. We only discovered the defect when we realised that the kettle had boiled itself dry! Poor QC? Could be a potential safety hazard.  Compared to other 5 star hotels, bathroom amenities seem a bit miserly. Only bath and hand towels were"
"Great & warm hospitality.  Pastries from shophouse are great, staffs from shophouse  are friendly & helpful (Especially Nicole) Also thanks Guest relationship team for sending a chocolate cake for us to celebrate our special occasion.  Will definitely visit again !"
"I stayed here last Dec, and decided to return again this week for the same valley Indulgence package. It was overall a pleasant experience, though we noted a few changes. In the valley wing club room, they no longer had a buffet line, but rather a designated tea & canapes set. It was definitely much safer by hygiene standards, though the service was slower. Also, they have implemented a booking for usage of the pool which is better to ensure that the number of pax is manageable, though this meant that you may not necc be able to get the pool at your preferred time. overall I enjoyed the experience  and especially the massage! :)"
"Our little family had a fantastic time. We stayed for 2 nights, had a late checkout until 7pm so we had 3 days. I was travelling with my 1 year old and 4 year old, and they had a wonderful time. Because of Covid, everything needs to be booked and our preferred times weren‚Äôt available, but we managed to work it out and get a good schedule. Buds was great (we‚Äôve been there before as non guest), and the splash area that‚Äôs been refurbished recently was so much fun. The room was lovely (garden wing deluxe pool view), with a huge bath as well as a shower. We also ate at origins and the food was particularly fantastic, I love how they cater for both adults and kids with great food and good options. The mushroom soup was so good, and my steak was amazing too."
"My wife and I just completed our stay at Shangri-La. This has been one of my most satisfying stay at a local hotel. I wanted to compliment both the hotel and the staff for the outstanding hospitality and warmth shown throughout our stay.   In our interactions with lobby/lounge ambassadors and the dining staff, it was evident how the hotel goes to the length to ensure the safety and welfare of the staff. It had certainly contributed to the motivation and dedication of the staff. They feel appreciated and as such they provide the best in class service to us in turn. Especially the staff who come from overseas. They were so pleasant and bright throughout and never showed any sign of missing hone.   Special bouquets to Edward, Jegan, Raja and Sharmila. These were the stalwarts of"
"As usual, the experience at Shangri La was nothing short of amazing. The service staffs were top notch! Bfast was immaculate. Been to other hotels before but Shangri la is in a class of its own. We are already planning for our next stay!"
"This is a long feedback to the staff of Shangri-la.  My family stayed here for 3D2N over the weekend.   The poor service started when we tried to book restaurant reservations for lunch and dinner over the 3 days. The hotel staff was adamant over the phone that all restaurants were fully booked despite us having $200 dining vouchers for use. However there were a lot of available slots when I personally went down to the restaurants.  On the first night, I was able to book The Line restaurant and we proceeded to order ala carte. We then waited 1 hour for a simple spaghetti and meatball dish. When asked why it took so long, the waiter informed that a overseas flight landed so they had to prioritize SHN travelers. The reason did not make sense!  After 1hr 15mins, we gave up, told"
We stayed for my husband‚Äôs 40th birthday celebration and were really pleased that we were upgraded to the deluxe one bed suite.   Everything was excellent during our stay. The children had so much fun with the Splash zone and Buds as well as the pool.   Breakfast at the Line was also great with the usual choices of breakfast regulars. If I may suggest though to include the drinks I.e. coffee and juices in the online menu ordering system as in the third and last day of our stay we decided to eat outdoors instead and it took us sometime to be able to find someone to help us get our coffee and I had to go indoors after sometime and find another someone to request for the same coffee before it finally did arrived. I think there are more staff indoors than outdoors hence the delay.
"Shangri-La has the best customer service managers!  Asst Guest Relations Manager, Mica ensured my proposal plans went smoothly and had provided me with all the assistance I ever need. The private dinning experience at Diner de Fleur was awesome! Bikash ensured all 6 course meals were served on time accompanied by chef Uanesan who came to introduce all the dishes and they all just taste great! Shangri-La never fails to provide me with wonderful experiences each time I step foot in the hotel."
"It was an excellent staycation for the kiddos. The kids are fully occupied in different activities from the fun @ Splash pool and the Buds, and Treasure Hunt around the hotel vicinity.   In the midst of the pandemic, we were served very promptly by the staff even when the restaurant is crowded in the morning!   Thank you for the great stay!"
Venue and food were both amazing. A really memorable experience. Hosts Bikash and Ganesan were professional as well as really friendly and made the evening fantastic! Will revisit in the future. Perfect option for a romantic and special night
"I had a memorable staycation with the kids. We have gotten the Fun Family Playcation package. The Package comes with the below.¬†$100 dining credit  - Free 2 indoor BUDS playground for 2 Child - Free water playground SPLASH zone  - Other kids friendly activities like baking & KOI Fish Feeding (although just piping cream, the kids enjoyed their cupcake with topping) - Free picnic basket¬†as well   Additional:¬† - Free cake for Birthday celebration - Free Goodie bag small lego free x2 set for the kids to self entertain during the stay - 4 homemade small cookies pack for kids - Free 2 pack of cookies and free fruits in room.. - Free upgrade of room as it is for birthday celebration¬†  I went to the counter early to check in, the check in is very systematic¬†with 8 counters. Due to safe"
"Overall, a very good staycation for the family. My child (6 years old) had a lot of fun; like to commend the crew at Buds for being friendly and helpful. There were many interesting areas to play and explore. Room was great as usual. Toilet was clean with the required amenities.   Dinner at Line was good, with my compliments to the Indian food in particular. Overall good selection of food; seafood was fresh and the chicken soup was great. Western selection (pasta, pizza and roasted meats) was a bit of a let down. Breakfast at Line was let down frankly speaking. Eggs were overdone, overcooked sausages, cold bread, bad bitter coffee from the machine, hot chocolate tasted bland, overall selection was little. The oats and fruits were good though, and one of the mgr ( i think her"
"I would like to share my quarantined experience in staying at the Shangri-la Hotel Orange Grove Rd in Singapore ( checked in 4/3 ) The hotel is well organised in the reception of guests on arrival direct from airport,  precise instructions were given  and safety precautions were implemented.   Rooms is spacious and clean. Ample hygiene items were provided. Meals served on time.  Body temperature readings taken daily. Trash cleared daily.   It has been a pleasant experience. Days pass by easily  and I am almost near to the completion of the SHN. Checking out 18/3.  Much appreciation to the management and all staff members  who provides their sterling services  endlessly to guests along  the quarantine floor inspite of the C19 pandemic .

"The hotel has taken extraordinary effort to make our anniversary stay memorable. Special room Decorations, flowers, cake and a gift. All you can think about anniversary. Not forgetting the great facility for kids. Always wonderful and we will come back for the 4th stay."
"We chose staycation at Shangri-la for our twins' birthday over other hotels because of the children friendly facilities. The entire experience has exceeded our expectations for the various reasons  1. Room Upgrade - Nice gesture for room upgrade and an even more pleasant surprise for the birthday deco in the rooms just for the kids! they were over the moon due to the spaciousness of the suite. It was an long overdue staycation due to the pandemic and Shangri-la definitely did not disappoint  2. Check in process - was professional, smooth and even the Duty Manager was there to meet & greet, the process did not take long but it was obvious that we have to adhere to mandatory health declaration but it will not take long  3. Staff Standard - I can't find faults at all, almost every"
Great stay at the Shangri-La Singapore. Met coming off the coach and everything went well regarding Covid restrictions. Given key to room following a brief meeting with the hotel staff. Stayed on the 14th floor. Meals were 3x a day delivered. Also had the option to get meals delivered in via apps on your phone. This worked well. Staff very attentive and printed out documents and delivered to the room. My room was at the front of the hotel so had great views.
"Check In - I arrived on a Thursday 1230pm and there was no other guests at the lobby. The strange thing is, the doorman came to open the car door for me as I alighted my Tada and then...... immediately turned around to walk away without offering any assistance with my luggage and laptop. A rather patchy service start  My room was ready, and I was given my welcome letter stating the Valley Wing benefits. I was also given a late(r) check out of 1pm from the original 12pm. My other letter explaining the USD100 dining credit was later slipped under my door.  Room - I am all for modern luxury than old school opulence but I really liked my Valley Wing Deluxe King (57SqM)! Although I've seen multiple reviews of the space, nothing beats seeing it in person and I liked it much better"
"We booked a stay at the Shangri-la to celebrate our 4 year old's birthday. They did not disappoint from the time we walked in through the lobby. From check in, we received goody bags for the children and a warm greeting not only for the parents but the tiny ones who are usually ignored. As we walked into our room, we were greeted with a beautiful display of balloons, a cake and a personalised card! During the stay, we were given access to Bud's and Splashzone for each night we were there. Our boys, thoroughly enjoyed the facilities and the staff at each station were friendly and encouraging. We would like to give a special thanks to Hafiz who was always at the door during our stay and greeted us with warmth every time. Great big compliment to Yana Arshad and her team for taking"
"We recently stayed at Shangri-La and had the best experience. The staffs are attentive and helpful. Samuel, Jegan, Mitchell  at the Valley Wing makes our stay here extra special. Make it a very personal experience. We would highly recommend this hotel."
"I am under great care by Mica. I would like to take this chance to specially thank Mica for assisting me with my proposal. It was successful and Mica went out of her way to help with the planning.  I would want to thank Sufia for arranging this special occasion for me as well. Very kind and am honoured to be under her care as well.   Thank you Sufia, Mica and Shangrila for this wonderful experience. We had a Very pleasant stay"
"Had a 3D2N stay at the hotel with my wife and 1-year old kid.   Room was spacious and clean. Although im doubting if there should be 2 tables in the room. 1 coffee table just by the sofa and another dining table(i assume) just in front of it. The bed however was a totally different story. It was hard as a rock and the pillows, while they looked super fluffy, were almost flat upon lying your head on them. The sleep quality could have been better.   The hotel is indeed family friendly with loads of facilities catered to kids like buds, splash zone and even a section of the swimming pool catering to kids. Check in and check out were a breeze.   Had the sleep been better, it would have been a wonderful staycation enjoyed by the whole family."
"My family has stayed at Shangri La on several other occasions and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. As such we had intended to return in the upcoming months for a stay.   4 Feb - Made a reservation with a complimentary voucher for 2/3 April.  5 Feb 4.30pm - Reservations replied that dates not available. Asked me to provide 3 other dates.  5 Feb 4.40pm - I suggested 2 firm dates and open dates in June weekends for reservation.   6 Feb, 7pm - Reservations informed they are still checking on availability  6 Feb, 7.50pm - I asked whether I could book using my voucher via url since they are still not able to respond on my availability since 5 Feb.  7 Feb, 11.20am - They still could not respond on my proposed dates. And now they tell me my voucher is subject to black out dates, and"

"I had a good 1 night staycation at the Valley Wing of the Shangri-La Singapore. The most premium wing of the 3 towers; had lived up to its reputation; but with a few reservations.   But let‚Äôs focus on the positives first.  The deluxe room was clean & very spacious. A bit dated but still acceptable for those of a more matured generation. A bottle of red wine, assorted box of chocolates & a platter of fresh fruit was appreciated as with their luxury L‚ÄôOccitane toiletries.   The service button was always promptly answered; despite The Valley Wing being 70% occupied.   The legendary ala carte breakfast was the highlight. It certainly failed not; particularly as my expectations were already very high. Special thanks to Butler Jega where his service at the Summit Room for breakfast"
"We spent a lovely 4 day 3 night staycation in a Garden Wing 1 bedroom suite.  We were greeted with the usual Shangri-la politeness and efficiency despite the many changes in place due to Covid. Social distancing and cleanliness were well executed and we always felt comfortable in our surroundings.  The room was lovely and spacious and I appreciated all the outlets for charging phones and other gadgets. You'd be surprised how many rooms I've come across with very few and oddly placed outlets.  With the 1 bedroom suite we were supposed to have access to the Tower Wing lounge, however, due to SHN guests in that area of the hotel, we were able to use The Summit Lounge instead. We enjoyed spending time here in the afternoons and The Valley Wing breakfast was outstanding. We were"

Staycation Review (28/29 Jan 2021) - 2 male mid-20s  Shangri-La Valley Wing  (Lobby Lounge)  Afternoon Tea:  Female Attendants were very friendly, drinks served promptly. One of them remembered our special order for the food when we requested a refill. (Rmbing we did not need additional scones portion) Overall, enjoyable afternoon tea time.  Evening canapes:  We were seated at the single table at the corner and it's just beside the bar.  But we were given little to no attention regardless to refilling our drinks or canapes.

"We had a really nice time during our stay that ended today. We especially liked the breakfast at the Summit Room in Valley Wing. The french toasts, bacon and poached eggs were among the many food we had and were really good! Thanks to Chef Carolyn (who came out to talk to us üôÇ) and Chef Anthony, too. The rest of the staff were really attentive too. It was a great experience today!"
"Excellence service with distinction, the F&B service crew from ‚ÄúThe Line‚Äù were professionally manner, attentive also clear all plate at the right time without making table look untidiness. And lastly the desserts are freshly well baked, with beautifully presentations."
Sharmilla from valley wing serving us at the bar has impeccable service skills. She was so accomodating and always served us with a smile and tried to accomodate our requests. Such an amazing service staff. Thank you. shangri-la!
"I seldom write reviews unless I‚Äôm extremely free, it‚Äôs 7am and I have been tossing around in bed.   Now, it‚Äôs staycation season in Singapore and many locals are looking for a getaway. Full of rave reviews here about great service and how kids are so happy here. I wish to cover something more basic or what a traveler is looking for.  The bed is firm and it‚Äôs totally reminds me of hotel beds in China hotels. The interior is old whole grandeur / resort which also is a very popular interior choice of Chinese hotels in China. Maybe because I usually book newly build hotels that are modern, edgy and hip so that I can observe new interior trends, materials and new design. This totally feels like the type of hotel my China suppliers will book for us. Feels very on the road for me."
"The staffs were extremely friendly and helpful. They gave a nice surprise decoration for my husband's bday celebration. My kids enjoyed their stay there. We brought my kids to Buds and they had a great time.  I appreciate their staff Mika, who pleasantly checked on us. As for dining, we were approached by Nicholas who was kind enough to let my son take his cereal with him, as he was busy running around. Overall, i love the services, the clean and safe environment. I Would recommend a stay at shangri-la."
"Had an enjoyable staycation at Valley Wing, Shangri-La Singapore.  The room is gorgeous but somehow relaxing and very comfortable.  Also the lobby lounge is luxurious and the service was stunning. They offer wide selection of drink menu, including champagne, cocktails and non-alcoholic beverages.  We really enjoyed our stay there.  Though the hotel is in the city, inside of the property is a totally different feel. Lots of green and pool is huge...just like an oasis in the city.  Thanks for all the staff who is very attentive and friendly, especially Aishah, front office team member at Valley Wing, who shared interesting story about the hotel and area.   Will look forward to go back there soon!"
"Our 1st staycation since the C-virus reached the shores of S'pore, in 23 Jan. 2020.  Now I understand why this hotel is a hot favorite with locals and tourists.  The exceptional level of customer service was experienced when I stepped into the lobby.  Mr Ono noticed me standing in queue and offered his assistance. He explained why it seemed crowded, how long the wait might be and suggested we wait in the nearby lounge.  I was grateful that although all the parking lots beside the building were occupied, he moved aside a signboard and guided me as I reversed my car into the space he created.  Ms Noara put a smile on my kids' faces when she offered 2 squirrels (soft toys). Realizing that I would like a new view from the room-window, she reserved a room on a high floor, with a"
"We stayed at the Valley Wing at Shangri-La over New Years and it was an amazing experience! The stay was very luxurious - the staff take note of your smallest preferences and ensure you have a pleasant stay. The room itself was huge and very comfortable. They included Mustela kids amenities for my son and even gave him a stuffed toy (squirrel) upon arrival - he loved the treatment!  The splash zone is particularly fun for all - we went there every day during our stay. Our son also loves buds and we were pleased they had a drop-off option for 4 and above - it gave us some downtime as well :)  And yes, we need to book time-slots for the splash zone and buds (the link is provided on arrival), but this was really easy and we always got the timings we wanted.  I also loved the"
"Was looking to this stay as we are celebrating a special occasion with a stay at the Valley Wing.   There were so many things to look forward to but to our disappointment.   1. Attention to Guest at the Champagne/Lobby Lounge  There aren‚Äôt many guests around but it is so difficult to get the attention of the wait staff on several occasions.   2. Attention to Guest at the Patio  We were relaxing at the Cabana located just at the Patio section and ordered drinks with the wait staff. After waiting for an hour, seeing them serving the Cabana beside us and not us, we were baffled and re-ordered. However, the drinks still did not reach us and we just left.   3. Food Delivery to the Room  We ordered some takeout and the hotel reception called us to come to collect the food instead of"
We had a pure indulgence and pampered stayed at the Valley Wing for my 30th Wedding Anniversary.  Served and assisted by very helpful staff which made our stay very memorable.   Looking forward to our next stay

"Just recently completed my 4th Stay at Valley Wing since CB started , A short 2day 1 night stay just before Christmas through their Valley Wing Indulgence Package.  Having stay at most of the five star hotel during CB, I must said that Shangri La Valley Wing Indulgence represent best Package of them all. It entitled me to have whole day Champagne ,afternoon tea,evening canap√©s, 90 min spa per couple at Chi , Summit Room Breakfast and lastly 8pm late check out.  We have make use of this package of our past stays and always enjoy with the company of their amazing Staff, during pre Christmas period the hotel is full house and Staff were working very hard to serve everyone.  Every Staff is great but I will like to give compliment to some of the staff we met for the past few visit"
Rooms were assigned promptly. Went to the pool even tho weather was not in favour but my kids loved it. Loved the indoor playground Buds. Kids were free to roam around the playground and play with various things. Would love to be there again soon!
"The hotel is located in a quiet serene part of downtown Orchard. It offers a huge array of dining options including a famous buffet restaurant (The Line). The rooms are huge and well designed. Staffs are professional. Overall, a hotel that is easy to recommend."
"Currently checked into the hotel this weekend, all excited for our staycation for a belated bday celebration for our baby who turned one. Came with high expectations after reading the reviews online, hence requested for early checkin at 2pm if possible for baby‚Äôs feed time.   Checkin process was no issue but the person attending to us left a very sour taste in my entire experience as the first person to attend to us. JOVINN wasnt warm in her welcome, DID NOT explain about my booking and rooms to me, DID NOT explain about how i can book for Buds and Splash Zone. She did not explain about things i usually would experience. I had 2 bookings for my parents in law as well and i requested for same floor or connecting rooms if possible and i understand if we cant get it since we are"
"From the moment I dropped off from my vehicle, I could feel the warm welcome and great hospitality from every service staffs I met along the way! Service was prompt, great high tea! My stay at the Garden Wing certainly feels like a holiday! Would love to return again soon! Keep on the good work!"
"As a jade member i have stayed many  shangri la hotels internationally. This is by far the worst stay mainly Because Of the poor hospitality by the frontline check in staff, ZILA. As the first person we met and who attended to our stay,  she was hostile, unfriendly and unreasonable. It is the first time I‚Äôve encountered such frontline staff, from shangri la nonetheless. Could the management seriously look into Zilas conduct as she totally ruined my staycation and this has never happened before for shangri la. Intend to also report her conduct to management too. This is a pity because all the other shangri la staff service was top notch and it‚Äôs A Great pity that Zila was the first person we met and unfortunately due to her, totally ruined the staycation experience."
"Myself, wife and 3 kids (11, 6, 18m) just finished what was a wonderful 3 nights in a the Valley Wing of this fabulous hotel.  I don‚Äôt normally write reviews but this place warrants sharing. The staff and level of service they offer are unmatched in Singapore - just amazing (a great team all round, so attentive and big shout out to Nora and Raja for making our experience perfect). Valley wing luxury and services are just wonderful.  Room, facilities, F&B, Spa are all excellent. If you are looking for a family friendly staycation in Singapore, look no further (lifeguards, buds play area, splash zone make this a favourite of all ages). We have done many and nothing comes close for a family.  Already booked the return on checkout and can‚Äôt wait."
"Check in was extremely fast and seamless. And the room is spacious, comfortable and nice.   We proceeded straight to splash zone after changing and it was very fun except that there were many leaves in the water. One thing to mention is that the lady at the Splash zone (sorry didn‚Äôt get her name) is very helpful and friendly. When I went back to the locker to get my phone, she approached me and let me know how I could use back the existing locker without moving my things to another locker. I find it a very nice gesture with initiative. :)  The hotel is also surrounded by nice greenery and beautiful koi fishes and waterfall which is soothing and relaxing. Overall we love the environment very much!   We also had ice cream at the waterfall kiosk beside the pool and then had our"
"In my last review I shared about the lesser-than-stellar service experience that we had during our stay at Valley Wing about 5  months ago. In response to my review, the General Manager hoped to welcome us back for a renewed experience again at the hotel. Well, we were back again, to spend our New Year at Valley Wing.  The very moment I stepped out of the car at Valley Wing entrance, I could sense the difference. I was readily greeted by friendly and helpful doorman Ryan who immediately came forward to help me with my bag and opened the entrance door for me. He also offered to keep our bags to be sent up to our room later (yes, our bags were already in our room when we went up an hour later). As both front desk counters were occupied, a staff by the name of Noel immediately"
"I have had 4 staycations at different five-star hotels recently and this was the most disappointing out of the lot.    Stayed for a night on a Sunday. We only managed to check in past 4pm as our room wasn't ready - we were given two coupons for complimentary welcome drinks while waiting, and the reception was extremely polite, so that was fine. We were initially allocated a room on the 4th floor with a pool view (which I would recommend that you avoid; the lobby is on the 3rd floor), but to our horror, there was a trail of ants on the table after we came back from dinner (I have photos and a video) - we didn't eat in the room and had only made coffee. We called them immediately and they suggested getting housekeeping to do some cleaning - I insisted on a change of room as having"
"Been a fan of Shangri-la for many years and i have recommended this hotel to many friends and colleagues to stay in. Loved their kids‚Äô club - Buds as well. Breakfast laksa is great, but the letdown was the cleaning cloth left in the room - apparently housekeeping was in a bit of hurry! Big no no especially for a world-class hospitality brand, and haste in cleaning a room is the last thing you want especially in covid times. Otherwise it would have been a pretty good experience."
"Had a 3D2N staycation to usher in 2021 from our room at the fabulous Valley Wing.  We were impressed with the vast improvement as compared to our experience of last staycation in July 2020.  We were happy that the hotel has beefed up their staffing to ensure prompt and attentive service at all times.  Despite it was a super peak period during the year end, we did not feel that the service was compromised in any way.  The other major improvement was the variety and quality of the food offered during afternoon tea and the happy hours.  Guests now are able to enjoy them inside Summit Room with the team of friendly staff from Valley Wing helping to deliver the food items selected by the guests.  The only disappointment was that our favourite Japanese set was removed from the Summit"
"Shangri-La hotels are best known for luxury and their well appointed amenities. I stayed at the one located at Orchard for a good period of 10 days. It is as beautiful from inside as it is from outside. The balconies adorned with flowers all over, looked straight out of a movie. Indeed a picturesque property it is.  I had booked a 1 BHK apartment there. It was a spacious one BHK ever. A large dining space, an enclosed kitchenette with all necessary vessels in place, a large bedroom with a king size bed and a bathroom. Although we didn‚Äôt get the balcony, but the space was large enough for a family to survive. The housekeeping service is superb, they try to serve you at the earliest. There was only one thing that bothered me and that was the washer/dryer which was common for the"
"Despite a bit of hiccup during check in, the service and hospitality of the Shang is truly impeccable. Staff know what to say, what to do, slip ups are rectified immediately; so much staff empowerment, a joy to see. Polite, service outlook is across the board- front desk, poolside, housekeeping - I am truly impressed. Facilities like splash park and buds are a haven for my toddler. And price wise, most reasonable for this many facilities, good restaurants and comfort. Certainly will be back and highly recommend!"
"We had a fabulous time with excellent service felt throughout the Shangri la team spearheaded by Nora, the Valley Wing manager. Having our whole family dressed up for Christmas was definitely welcomed by all. We will be back."
"We had our breakfast at The Line restaurant and due to Covid 19, breakfast can only be ordered with pre-set menu. The restaurant waitress, New, was attentive to my kids‚Äô needs and went the extra miles to give them plain croissants instead of the normal mix basked of breads amongst other requests. Great client focused mentality and willing to go the extra miles!"
"It is a good and fantastic Place to visit, good hospitality service, staffs are all well trained. Felt happy when we are here, good recommendation from friends, hope to come back again, thank you for everything."
"My wife and I booked the couples retreat staycation package for stay during the Christmas weekend. While the hardware was good, we were disappointed and felt that the package was not fulfilled. Under the package, we were entitled to 50% off for couples massage. However, the spa was fully booked during our stay. We were given $50 dining credit, and additional 20% discount off food. However, the Waterfall Italian restaurant was fully booked during our stay. In the end, we redeemed a bottle of wine instead. In the Expedia booking, one of the features stated was early in at 10am and late check out at 2pm, subject to availability. Needless to say, the hotel was fully booked and no early check in nor late check out was allowed. During the stay, we requested daily newspapers but were"
"Enjoyed 3 staycations to celebrate our 30th Anniversary.  Our staycation at Shangri-la was our third and final one.  However, though nice, we did not get the wow feeling that we got from our staycations at Fullerton and Andaz, both of which were equally great and wonderful!  We stayed for 1 night in the Garden Wing.  Room was spacious, very well maintained, but dated.  And there was not much of a garden view from our room.  Thanks for the nice cake for our anniversary delivered to our room!  Hotel has a nice grand lobby.  Breakfast at The Line was sumptuous.  Staff there were attentive and service was prompt. Gym and pool were great.  We had lunch at the Waterfall Restaurant which turned out to be disappointing.  The hotel also messed up the bill, and added the dining credit to"
"We (2a2c - 1 10yo & 1 7yo) had a superb 3d2n stay and for someone who doesn‚Äôt believe in staycations, I‚Äôm a convert now! We really felt like we were holidaying in a resort outside of Singapore! Great service throughout starting from check-in, lifeguards at the pool, staff at the poolside bar, splash zone, buds and the restaurants! Kids didn‚Äôt want to leave and want to stay at the premises forever to quote them - adults too actually üò¨! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and can‚Äôt wait to come back soon! Thanks very much to the whole team for the great hospitality!"
"Excellent experience from the arrival till the end.  My family and I always felt at home, especially thanks to an amazing and attentive staff (merci Dominique!).  The stay in the Valley Wing is an experience I‚Äôll recommend to everyone. Hopefully, to be repeated soon."
"The wonderful and impeccable service of Shangri la!  I called for 2 care baskets at a time when they are full on orders, and when delivery was full and wasn‚Äôt possible anymore (and I also asked for a minimal customisation). They did it anyway with a lot of smiles and patience so that the festive cheers could be brought to 2 on quarantine at different locations.  I also changed the pick up timings 3 times.. And when I was worried that they wouldn‚Äôt be ready.. they told me that they were all long prepared and ready so that I‚Äôd be sure to get the baskets even if I move the pick up date forward!   I know there has been a short of hands and staffs at services industry and therefore I am grateful for the great service experience I received from Jonathan, Crystal and Ellen!! Service at"
"I booked a 3D2N family playcation package at the hotel and stayed at the garden wing. Check in was a pleasant experience- despite there being a crowd, a staff attended to me and ushered me to the next available receptionist. Grace, the receptionist recognized that we were celebrating my wife's birthday during the stay and wished her promptly. There was a birthday amenity placed in the room along with a personalized birthday card which made for a great start to the staycation.  Everything great about this hotel(amenities, friendly staff, great dining options) has been mentioned so i won't elaborate on that here. What I wish to highlight is the level of hospitality that the shangri la strives to achieve. From addressing me by name with each phone call, to their attentiveness to"
"This is my third staycation in singapore in the last 6 months and was definitely the best by a long shot.  I stayed 2 nights /  3 days at the Shangri la - Orchard , with my wife and 8 year old daughter.  I initially booked the garden wing suite but was upgraded to the valley wing suite , which was much better.  The valley wing rooms are more modern and equipped that the garden wing rooms.  The valley wing suite was very spacious, luxurious and comfortable.   We also really enjoyed the valley wing lounge access which had free flowing drinks including champagne all day and canapes in the afternoon and evening.    The Shangri la is amazing for families with young kids.  My daughter enjoyed the splash zone , ginger bread decorating class, buds, the pool etc.  One recommendation is"
"With the COVID situation, we could not travel overseas so we decided to try out Shangri-La Singapore Orchard after I saw the Splashzone & activities @ Buds that the kids could indulge in. Seriously, I thought 2 nights were long but I kinda regret now - should've booked more nights!!! The staff were warm, friendly - made me felt really like I was on a vacation and with the poolside drinks & food, time really flew past while we were all relaxing around and in pool. Activities scheduled by Buds team were also fun - my kids are tweens so they didn't like the kiddish stuff but Buds had activities like Tie-Dye shirt & baking to keep them entertained for a while. :) We'll be back in Mar next year - I will definitely book more nights then! Kuddos to the Shang team for making our Dec"
"It was a fantastic birthday staycation for me. Thank you Iffah from front office for being very professional and delivering excellent standards of service. I would also like to express my gratitude & appreciation to the guest relations, housekeeping for being very prompt. This is the best staycation I have ever experienced in Singapore. They even go beyond service for my little one and I am very grateful for that. The hotel has exceeded my expectations, in service, hospitality and professionalism."
"On 20th Dec, we were at the Line for breakfast. As we came very late due to caring for my baby, the breakfast had closed. The were not serving anymore breakfast although it is still before 11am. Manoj took the initiative and offered us some food and fruits that were still at the counter. Although we couldn‚Äôt choose what to eat but it was sufficient as we couldn‚Äôt ask for me. This is customer service at its best! NB: There were a few staff that simply ignored us. Worst, there was one that pretend that we are invisible despite waving our hand at him. Ask for Mr Manoj! Thanks for going for the extra mile. We really appreciate it!"
"Awesome Staff who are concern about my family's well-being consistently during our stay, Will definitely return for another stay! To all staff, hang in there, we will overcome this pandemic together and soon will return to normalcy!"
"Always feel very relaxed and happy whenever I visit Shangri-la hotel whether it is for a meal or staycation. This year we decided to try out the ala carte buffet at the Line as our boy was a picky eater and was pleasantly surprised about the efficient process despite the restaurant operating full house. Chew, who was taking care of our area makes excellent effort to attend to our needs. Thumbs up and keep up the good work!"
"We went for a 2D1N staycation at Shangri-la (Orange Grove) on 13/12/20 to 14/12/20. We had a wonderful time there and all the staffs who‚Äôve attended to us were very helpful and friendly. They have all made our stay in Shangri-la an enjoyable and pleasant experience!   Kudos to the receptionist whom attended to us when we came earlier for check in and the staff arranged for an upgrade to a bigger room for us (with no extra charge). She made this special arrangement so that we won‚Äôt have to wait too long (originally we booked Garden view) for the room to be ready and hence we were able to go into our upgraded room right away. On top of that, the staff also arranged for us to have complimentary drink at The Line. Staff Nicholas from The Line served us with warm welcome and provided"
"Thanks for the birthday cake for birthday celebration. The only disappointment is it was a Xmas log cake instead of a birthday cake. It came without candle and cutting knife.  I appreciates on the early check-in arrangement for us. But there were no welcome fresh fruits for Gold member.   The picnic basket is really special but the food from the picnic set are all cold from the fridge. There are some activities for kids, but most of them are suitable for younger kids (preschooler). Suggest to add more activities for older kids."
"We arrived on 13 Dec morning after a long flight. There were many hotel staff to guide us every step of the way. It was very well organized. Check in was at one of the function rooms and was a breeze for about 14 people who arrived at around the same time. Although we were all on SHN, I don‚Äôt feel like we were treated as second class. Staff happily and patiently answered our questions. Our bags made it to our rooms even faster than us. Meals arrived on time as scheduled. They were generally nice, with some tasted better than others. I ordered some food from Grab and another delivery company and they were promptly delivered to the room by the concierge. I want to say a big thanks to all the staff who were on duty on that morning and to the concierge staff who worked tirelessly"
"We just completed a 3 night family staycation at the hotel and all I can say is superb on every level. The standout was the staff. Every single staff member we engaged with was happy, polite, friendly and helpful. They knew their job, they helped solve, they asked if we were okay. It was service at a level that justifies the cost and the experience. We stayed in the valley wing, highly recommended for all the extras. The family play cation package added to the experience for our 7 and 9 year old boys. Pool access was well managed, and despite it being busy and only a 3 minute taxi drive from our house it felt like we had got on a plane and flown off to somewhere exotic, fun and fabulous. This is our second staycation post circuit breaker, and as a family we cannot fault the"
"It was a lovely experience staycationing in the Shangri-la's Valley Wing. Upon arrival, you feel like you have returned to your luxurious home. The reception by the old Japanese bellman was so professionally done. You may forget that you are in Japan. The check-in by the manager, Nora, was again done so professionally. It was like talking to a friend.   Our luggage was all ready in our room when we entered. There was a quiet element of WOW FACTOR. The view was great and the room was wonderful. Spacious and well planned room with an equally spacious and exceptionally functional bathroom, with all its defined spaces.  Perks of staying at the Valley Wing ... many! An exclusively peaceful and quiet sanctuary !You can choose to sip your champagne or Singapore Sling and more from"
"I appreciate how the Shangri-la team pays attention to details when it comes to service and providing the needs of their guests. I stayed with my two children at Shangri-la f and was delighted with the quality of the amenities. I've had some of my best sleep in this hotel, and my kids also said they enjoyed their stay."
"The initial warmth and speedy service soon faded away as I checked-in to my room with them. The food was grotesque. Would you ever eat quinoa with raisins paired with beansprouts and tofu? I mean the chef seems like a very confused person and shouldn't a trained chef in a supposed 5 star hotel know the difference on how western and asian food hits your taste palette. I'm not suggesting fine dining but if you can't do fusion, stick to the basics, possibly cheaper too. On top of that, I was told that your pastry was made the night before and sent out to the rest of the Shangri-La group hotels and thus the extremely bad pastry. It's soggy and disgusting, being in the F&B business you'd know to eat pastry fresh or even hours of making of making it. Simple guys, think simple."
"While I have been to this hotel for a number of times, this visit was my first staycation here. We were here primarily for the Buds and Splashzone. Else we are more likely found in the main Orchard road hotels for a shopping staycation or Sofitel Sentosa for a relaxing stay.  One day prior to the check-in, I received an online check-in notification through their app and what surprised me was the incidental deposit the hotel has requested. For a 2 nites stay, I was asked to put up a $1.5+k deposit for incidental charges and this amount also included the room rate. Issue here is that I have already fully paid for the room rate a few months back and thus, why are they charging me for the room rate again? Nonetheless, I proceed to make the payment to facilitate the online check-in."
"It‚Äôs our first and I must say the best experience ever for the family. There‚Äôs so much activities that hotel offers and regretful that we only booked for a night. From our checked in, we were greeted warmly by Ms Calista. She is such a pleasant receptionist, whom makes us feel so comfortable in making queries and she truly anticipated our family needs. She over heard our conversation when we had to make changes on our dinner reservation when slots at Buds for our daughter timing was not available. For that, we are totally impressed and would like to thank her for organising it so well for us. Special thanks to 2 guest relations that noted on my request for arranging cake surprise for both husband and son birthdays! Ofcourse, not forgetting a tall very tall gentleman that handed"
"We had a wonderful staycation at the Shangri-la Orchard. We were glad we chose in the Valley Wing indulgence package as it really made our stay particularly luxurious. We were there for my birthday and the staff kindly arranged a free cake. We took our toddler daughter who enjoyed Buds and Splash Zone (though she was disappointed to find out that most of the water slides were for 4+). We really appreciated the outstanding service and Le Yi who served us in the lounge was particularly friendly. The massages we had with our package massages were very good.  We are vegetarian and although they had options in the lounge, it was a bit limited and they did not create additional dishes to compensate for this (as they did at the Ritz), which would have been appreciated. Nevertheless, we"
"Impeccable service from receptionist and dining staff. Especially thanks for Mdm New from THE LINE, for her attentiveness and excellent service. Her dedication to great customer service makes us felt comfortable and well taken care of. Truly holding up to the great customer service motto of the hotel chain. Thanks for the great experience!"
"similar to hania_sg, I just had a staycation at fullerton the week before. Like at fullerton, staff at shangrila were really nice and pleasant. But at shangri la there are lots of activities for the little ones so would strongly recommend to families with young kids. special thanks to haliz, iflah, hyen yen. there was a filipino male staff at buds who was so nice too but i didnt manage to get his name. he was giving me advice on how to change my splashzone resevation due to the rain. my 6 yr old boy enjoyed his stay there. He got to do gingerbread cookies, play at the buds indoor playgrd and the splashzone. My son had such a great time.  My husband felt the room was too dim. I also felt cleanliness was acceptable but could be improved given the high standards of shangrila."
"We just had a great staycation at Fullerton thus we expected Shangri-La would give the same experience. But oh boy, you guys even set the bar higher in term of service. Every staffs that we had interaction with were all genuine, friendly and enthusiastic. From Ms Callista who handled our check in, Ms Dora Tan the servicing manager who greeted us and came with surprise for the kids, Ms Ling Ling who took good care of us during breakfast at The Line, the crew at splash zone and buds (Rajesh and Lionel),  Nicholas at The Line who took effort to chat with our kids while they were waiting for the ice cream and not forgetting the friendly doorman. Thank you Shangri-La for the wonderful memory. We will be back soon."
"Paul is very attentive, he pays attention to the guest and is aware of your preference plus will give recommendation when he was @ the line for BF today on 2nd of Dec and on 19th of Nov too! Great job to you and your team!"
"Had a wonderful times again at Shangri-La with a fun filled activities for kids - splash zone, koi fish feeding, kid friendly pool, garden picnic and buds by Shangri-La. The team has put up Christmas decorations across the hotel areas and add the festive feeling to the stay. I would like to compliment New from The Line for her service during breakfast. It was school holiday and busy peak hour, however she delivered excellent services to ensure we are served on time. My 18months toddler removed her shoes without our knowings and we left the restaurant after breakfast. New took the shoes and searched for us to return. I really appreciate her great service and feel proud for a local Aunty who had demonstrated high professionalism as a hotel staff. Thank you Shangri-La for a"
"Nice place to be at, and dine in. Came with my family to celebrate my sister‚Äôs birthday, and went to the Line Restaurant. The check in was fast and simple, staff were nice, not overly crowded. Well organised hotel, and great decorations."
"We stayed in the ShangriLa Orange Grove road for the weekend in the Valley Wing. Couples retreat option is definitely the best value for great quality including the 90 minutes massage, high tea and canap√©s. Not to forget the rose bubble bath my friend managed to try was also included in the price. I would highlight the super great waiter who looked after us, Alvin who is the most professional waiter and great host as part of the ShangriLa.  I would highly recommend this option to friends, families and couples. Don‚Äôt miss out if you enjoy quality time in a nice atmosphere."
"We wished to compliment the following staff members that delighted us. We checked-in on 18 Nov for a one night stay.   1. Check-in staff Miss  Jovinn for making the additional arrangements on top of what I believed had already been pre-arranged. She is detailed and is knowledgeable to address me queries. Her sweet and warm disposition really made our check-in enjoyable and delightful.   2. Mdm. Jenny, our room attendant. She made a point to pause her work when she saw us leaving our room to greet us and to find out if there is anything she could help while we are away. We are happy with the level of cleanliness in our room.   3. To the staff whom did the shoe-shine for us. Whoever you are, Thank you so much. We can see the effort you put into making our shoes shine.   4. We"
"We had the most wonderful time at Shangri-La celebrating my friend‚Äôs birthday.  We decided to upgrade to the Valley Wing Indulgence package a few days before arrival and the reservation team was happy to help with this no problems.   What an indulgence it was - we had access to the lounge with daily afternoon tea and evening canap√©s along with UNLIMITED Moet champagne and cocktails. In addition it included a 90 minute massage at the Chi Spa. I would say go ahead pay that extra $200 per room just to upgrade, it‚Äôs so worth it!   The rooms were spacious and clean. Bathroom was huge and plenty of wardrobe space. They had set up balloons and cake for my friend which was a lovely touch.   The only improvement I would say is that the rooms were a little dated and in need of more"
