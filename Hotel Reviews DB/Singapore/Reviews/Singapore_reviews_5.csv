"Location was perfect and it was a short walk away from the orchard underground linkway to various malls, pretty much sheltered all the way too. Rooms are quite small but comfortable, more suitable for staycay people who don‚Äôt need much space or don‚Äôt stay indoors all the time. Be careful when taking up their early check in request as encountered their staff biting back at me for checking in early when I requested for late check out as my family and I are heading out on check out day and was afraid might not come back in time to check out so asked as a precaution."
comfortable and cozy room with great lightning in room. Huge window for city view and good ambience to enjoy a shower with those stunning view. Despite room size is smaller then average but many factors overcome this tiny down side.
"Hotel location is convenient walking distance to Orchard shopping. Rooms are too small but compact which want we need, only thing not comfortable is the mattress and pillows too soft (should improve on these). Service crew are polite and friendly ! If got promo don't mind to come again."
"Overall experience is ok. Good location, clean, great staff & new experience with robot. Just room is really small and not worthwhile to upgrade. Not suitable for family with young kids unless you are willing to pay for experience."
"The room is clean. For location wise, it is very accessible    to varieties for food. Located near to shopping malls and Orchard MRT as well. The staffs were very friendly. Checking in/out is very simple. would consider to come back for another round for staycation."
"Checked in on good friday. Took around 2hrs to check in due to the long queue..Room is very clean i would say, everything is working well..bed is cool able to adjust. Easy to connect laptop to TV with HDMI cable to watch youtube & disney+. Room is just nice for 2 pax, would definitely book here again!"
No complaints on the location. It is very assessable to all big shopping malls.  The room is pleasant. good for solo or couple staycation the view is great due to the high floors. the internet is stable and fast.
"Booked this hotel after reading the many good reviews left by guests.   Many thanks to the hotel to accommodate our request for adjoining rooms, the early check-in, and the birthday surprise delivered by Yolanda.  Many thanks also to Eswari and Aldrina for the patience shown in clarifying the parking charges. S$21.40 for a single-use exit pass regardless of the number of hours/days stayed.   The location of this hotel is very good. There are many big shopping malls and food establishments right beside it. The MRT is very nearby too.   The room layout is somewhat unconventional with the bathroom located right against the exterior windows. This means guests have to choose between privacy or good view and natural light.  It also means lots of curtains up/down. It will take some"
"Great cool hotel for a staycation.  It is so convenient to walk everywhere on orchard road!  Though the room is a little small, the high floor makes up for it!  The breakfast was straight forward and quick service!  I love to hang out for drinks another time!"
"Views of Orchard Road were nice although it was troublesome to have to lower the blinds every time I needed to use the toilet.  Although futuristic, I was very disappointed by the bed.  When it was flat, I could feel a depression where the 'bend' of the mattress occurs.  It led to a very uncomfortable night's sleep.  For those who are sensitive to their mattresses, you may want to give this place a miss."
"Awesome team at hotel. Complementary early check in and check out via self service touchscreen.  Clean and cosy room. Near Orchard MRT, Shopping Mall and cinema. 24 hrs cafe round the corner and 24hr convenient shop near by. Decent breakfast"
"The hotel is suitable for family. The location is fantastic. I would definitely recommend to my friends and family. Will come back again with my family. Although the room is small, it is cosy and compact."
"Soft beds, breakfast not fantastic, gym size can put about 5pax, love the complimentary early check in, nice staff and free flow of water. Bed can be adjusted up and down with button, sensor lights for the room, know how to light up when you wake up, cabled tv channels but not smart tv, rain showers, good amenities"
"I love how the hotel are just walking distance to the shopping malls. It is super convenience, cozy and totally love the view. Would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends. I wouldnt mind coming to this hotel again!"
"Love the view at night from the shower area. Efficient layout for a small room roughly 14-16sqm. Amenities will good. Towels are clean, sheets are clean, bed are super soft. Its a happy place with purple grey theme. Similar to M social but much better."
"It was a convenient and not over-priced hotel to consider within the heart of Orchard. With minimum contact, they have 2 cute robot, Yolanda and Yoshi to do the errands. Room is just big enough for 2 to 3 pax. Otherwise get the bigger room."
"Overall the hotel room is quite decent. Staff are extremely friendly and quick to attend to your enquiry/request. Amenities in the room are fantastic, they have everything that you need like iron & iron board, umbrella, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, body lotion and hand wash."
Complimentary Early Check-in.. Very Clean Room - Thank you to the Chambermaid who cleaned up & prepared the room for my check-in.. üòÄ Friendly & accommodating staff all around.. üòÑ Super cute Yolanda & Yoshi... ü§£ Room Amenities are well stocked up & good... ‚ò∫Ô∏è Western Cold & Hot Breakfast range is Big & Yumms üòõ
"Hotel room was cool, I like the robots sing bday song for me, the city view was nice, the toilet floor is slippery after shower, the bed is recline so it‚Äôs new experience, but the blanket is full of dust fibers especially when we sit and move the blanket fiber dust start to floating around the air."
"The hotel is newly built in 2017. There are 610 rooms. Parking is $20 per day or $3 per hour entry. There are 30 floor. Room temperature can only be set between 21 to 24 degree. You can ask for extra towel, mineral water, shaving kit again. Reception lobby and drop off area is located at level 2.   During check in you have to scan the qr code. Then the staff would direct you to the counter and assist you to check in. Need to fill up form and write in your full nric number (not last 4 digits) and date of birth. This is for all guests and visitors. Room floor and room number is already assigned to you. Similar to airline self check in system where you can't choose the floor or room. The lobby is like a touch and go station. No seat or sofa like other 4* and 5* hotels in Singapore."
My family and I enjoyed our stay and we appreciate that we were assigned connecting rooms. That was a nice touch. Thank you for the complimentary early check in as well! We got to start our plans early. Wouldn‚Äôt mind making a second trip to Yotel in future. :)
This is one of the nicest hotel I've been in and I've stayed at expensive five star hotels before. Of course you shouldn't expect the greatest facilities or a huge room for the price you're paying. But the room is frankly amazing. I will definitely be coming back here
We were very impressed with d way breakfast was served as we did not have good service or food at Carlton Hotel.We were served by mdm Eileen who anticipated our needs even before we asked. The staffs at reception are very young but respectful.
Generally ok. Cups for brushing teeth not provided. Wireless screen mirroring intermittently disconnected. Wash basin outside toilet and shower require additional time to get used to. Room service for cleaning is provided only upon request.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the team especially Shahrul whom arranged for an upgrade as me and wife were celebrating our anniversary together. He was extremely nice and pleasant to talk to. Thank you very much for making our stay as comfortable and smooth as possible. It's only a day and we've already missed Yolanda and Yoshi! They were really helpful!
"Enter next to Thai Embassy.    Swift check in and out. Room is small but sufficient. Retractable (hospital type) bed to save space. Safe provided. Ample toiletries, coffee tea, bottled waters in room. Clean sheets and towels. Full length window through the bathroom.  Lots of food and marts around hotel. Room service by robots. Cool, though not interactive."
Overall our 3D2N staycay experience was splendid and we enjoyed our stay in Yotel greatly. It was value for money and location is great as well. It was a birthday celebration for my partner.  We are thankful for the complementary early check in given and the great service by the staff. The room is small but we are not bothered by it as the toilet make it up for space and view. A robot- Yolanda came up to sing my partner a birthday song with macarons and card signed by the staff.  The gym experience was just good as well. It was an enjoyable stay and we would love to come back again next time. We love the robot too. :)
Quite as okay hotel for its price. But the shower is not suitable for 3 people. Should at least provide an extra blind outside the toilet to prevent others from looking inside while others are showering. As people may mistake this as a hotel made for couples for other purposes.
"Choose the hotel as we have errands to run in orchard and the price was within budget. However, in the end we paid $40+ for parking. Which we can stay in a better hotel. No housekeeping done when we were out. Overall, not value for $ and definitely our last visit"
"Good location in orchard. Very accessible to ion, taka, shaw, tangs and many more. Room was very small. Cool bed. But room service need to improve. Requested for 2 face towels, waited for more than half an hour. Need to call a second time then send over 1 only. Should include the face towels in the room."
"Excellent location, just behind main Orchard Road shopping belt. Hotel and interior furnishings looks new.  Rooms though small but efficient use of space. Despite lower price for Singapore hotels, still provides most amenities including toiletries, hairdryer, iron & ironing board, water boiler, safe and small fridge. Toilet is of good size, no need to shower beside the toilet bowl getting it wet and enough leg space in front of toilet bowl.  Wifi is easy to connect and fast. TV has free to air channels and many cable channels. You can also cast from your device to it with simple instructions on the TV provided. There is also a HDMI port on the wall beside the bed though I did not try it. A number of power points and USB power ports provided around the room.  Front desk staff"
"Checked into this property with the purpose of having it as a staycation session for my boyfriend and I. We stayed here for 2 days and 1 night (checked in on 23/03 and checked out on 24/03). The rooms are beautiful, cozy and neat and the location of this property are conveniently accessible for transportation, shopping and for looking for food places. Also, their lift lobby are lit with the neon lights which are so pretty and the hallway suits the scene for filming a horror movie. Highly recommend this property and will be back there someday!"
"Location is great, right in orchard area. Bed was a little too soft for me. hotel is clean, staff are attentive towards my needs. overall, still enjoyed my stay here. price is reasonable, will come back again."
great place to staycay & the facilitiee is great over there too. had a very exp for two days and would totally recommend people to come with their family & friends. the facilities & amenities is great too.
Perfect location with wonderful service. The check in staff even noted it was my birthday month and had Yolanda (the robot) sent up some cookies. Nice touch to a pleasant evening. Will definitely stay here again.
"Wanted to simply stay here due to the robots. Specially called to request for some small items to be delivered to us and I can say definitely the highlight of our trip.   Room wise-we know it is small. 3 adults to move around, it is a squeeze...but can‚Äôt complain as we know that‚Äôs what we have signed up for. Bathroom was okie, just that I think you need to be highly comfortable with one another as somehow, you would be able to the a bit of the silhouette of the person in the bathroom. At least it wasn‚Äôt an issue for us.   Bed was very soft. Need to find spots with not so soft bed. But number of pillows was definitely enough.   Highly recommended if you only need the hotel to sleep and rest. If you want to just stay in the hotel to enjoy the facilities...then I would choose other"
"Since we have not utilize the SRV vouchers, we thought it would be nice to book a short staycation before the school reopen. I came across Yotel Orchard, which is in a nice location in Orchard, and it seems like a cool hotel, with the futuristic theme. The price was reasonable considering, it can sleep 3 persons and come with breakfast as well. We arrive slightly later at 3pm to check in, and there was no crowd in the lobby. We used the mission-control (manned counter) to check in, and pay an additional top up for the overnight parking which came up to be $21.40.  After checking in, we went to the 10th floor to book the time slot for the swimming pool. The pool is quite small, and with children playing in it, you have to watch where you swim.  The room was nice and clean,"
Located in the central area of orchard. The room is so cool. Breakfast is limited choices but it tastes yummy. The mission control team sent the robot to sing the birthday song for us which is so memorable during the stay. Thanks Yotel.
"First Class Queen room - The Room was extremely small, not worth the price paid. There wasn't enough space to even open my luggage. The room was very small, the bathroom was extremely small. And the deck is not clean."
"The bed is quite comfortable but the space is a bit cramp. If booked 2 rooms with connecting rooms, the interconnect doors are not able to stay opened. There is no stopper provided. The location is quite accessible to F&B outlets, however quite a walking distance from Orchard MRT station. Do check out the expiry dates of the items in the room, as some may be expired or near expiry. The overall staying experience is just ok."
Enjoy my staycation. First time i book this hotel. The bed is very comfortable...can watch my favourite korean show..they provide hair dryer n ironing stuff. The shampoo n conditioner is a quality one. Hope to comeback again.
"Thank you team Yotel from the front desk to the komyuniti restaurant team. Everyone was helpful and took great care of my family with my mother in the wheelchair.  We got early checkin as our connecting room was ready about an hour before the scheduled check in time. Received a sweet surprise from Yolanda for our birthday boy and enjoyed the pool for the 2 nights stay. Proximity to amenities in the surrounding area means no shortage of food and activity...we even caught a midnight movie on our last night stay. And singapore being so efficient, everything was a grab away. But once again thank you team Yotel. You guys are awesome. My mother and kids gives a sign of approval so we will definitely come back. Highly recommended. Ps, remember to bring down the blinds when you want to"
"Reason is simple, made a request for check out at 1pm was rejected. And then when I ask how about checking out slightly after 12noon, even like 1205, person name Sahrul on the phone at the front desk say NO.  Enough said for NOT accommodating for simple request"
"If you are planning a family staycation for 3 (8-10yo) and are able to and willing to afford the First Class suite for 2N ( no more ) this is an option. Suite is ok for 2.5 people no more than 3 adults, windows are ceiling to floor in the showerstall so lower those blinds or prepared to flaunt what you got! Be either early (before 8am or after 955/10ish am to avoid breakfast crowd) as minimally staffed. OK for the one off experience but not Round 2 for us."
"Check-In was done in a swift. Staff at Mission Control was really friendly and explained clearly on the details, clauses. Room service was also efficient, met Yolanda, the robot :D Definitely made my day. Called in to Komyuniti to order some food to dine in the room before checking out. Despite several return calls due to some technical issues, not much delay to my hungry stomach, kudos to that! Food quality was good and thanks to all the prompt and good service, it made my staycation a really good one. Will definitely be back again!"
"We booked a family room with view and stayed for one night. TThe location is fantastic and we used it as our base to explore the area.  A lot of eateries and shopping ccentres.  Been to many places particular Emerald hill,  Orchard gateway library and wheelock ÂçìÂ∞îbookshop."
"Check in was relatively easy. Acdonia (can‚Äôt rmb exactly) was very helpful and friendly and full of smiles. Cabins are small but location is good. With rediscover vouchers, definitely made it value for money."
"The staff service from the reception area to restaurant was great ! Hotel WiFi was fast and automatically connected. The room was cosy, compact, very clean and well equipped with amenities and we were impressed by the special delivery by their cute robot, Yolanda."
"Extremely warm and friendly welcome from Mission Control! Room was cosy and well-equipped. Urban skincare co. range pampered our hair and body throughout the weekend. Apart from occasional kids running and shouting along corridor, no other noise were heard from neighbouring cabins. Everyone wore a smile on their face and calls to Mission Control were answered on the first ring. Thank you for the wonderful weekend!"
A nice hotel with great interior designs but it would be better if the divider of the room and the toilet or the glass door of the toilet can be covered for more privacy while showering or doing bathroom business as it was quite uncomfortable knowing that our roommates are able to see the figure of us showering as it was translucent.
"Bed mattress should be replaced, Check-in process should be more efficient and your hotel staff should put in effort to expediate the check-in process, Food and drinks at restaurant is good, hotel location is good"
"Booked the hotel for staycation. Staffs are friendly and room was clean although it is small. Worth for friends but not recommended for family staycation as it is small. Overall, it was an enjoyable stay."
"room is small. so if you prefer bigger room , sorry . The price is not too high is a plus, the small room cannot command too high price also. If too expensive, resident in future will not returned . The breakfast is good, keep it up. Maintain the food is served hot is a plus. Variety is abundant ."
Staycation was ok. room safe clean. No greeting from service staff. No smile at all. Breakfast is good. A lot of selection. Room is comfortable. Morning noise level was noisy despite staying at 28 floor.
Great location nice view high floor. Would recommend to anyone that loves shopping . Easily accessible to halal food . I shall be back  with the whole family soon. Keep it up Yotel. Awesome hotel in the heart of the city and good price
Great Stay. Comfortable Bed. Great service. Cool robots. Clean environment. Variety of channels to watch. Great view from the higher floors. The staffs were very polite and kind. Room service was great
"Good location, good customer service, cozy and clean environment.  Everything is good overall.   Although the cabin is small, you can find anything you may need there like iron, ironing board, hairdryer, slippers......etc."
very happy with the stay i had in Yotel! would recommend this if u want to get away from the hustle of singapore! the view was also very pretty from where we were and the overall atmosphere is pretty cozy!
I feel that the room is pretty much acceptable for the price but don't expect too posh settings. Minimalist setting with all the necessary amenities that a traveller or short trip will need. The toilet is more spacious than the room in my opinion.
Great Stay recommending to other family members & friends. Great stays.. Surrounds with lots of shops for shopping and meals.. friendly staff and sophisticated rooms. All safety measures with proper sop for covid. THANK YOU.
"Pleasant short staycation especially for destressing moment during the pandemic.  Friendly,efficient and professional staffs. Awesome location for food lovers and those who loves the night life experience."
"in overall, affordable stays suitable for staycation, place to rest/ relax. while the cabins do not have an absolute sound proofing, i have had a rather comfortable stay during my stay. it would be better if something could be done to it, as i could occasionally hear conversations from other cabins."
"Room may be a little smaller than the usual hotel rooms, but makes it up in terms of innovative use of space and modern looks. Bed is comfy, though pillow is a bit too soft for my liking. Can be changed although I did not. Bathing facilities is awesome, and breakfast is filling and delicious, though all ala carte. Very convenient location to restaurant and bars along orchard road, and the feel is like staying at a city hotel overseas. Recommended!!!"
Not over price hotel that provides the best bed and service! Property is so clean and amazing with the most convenient location. The stay makes me want to return to the property again and not forgetting Yolanda who is so impressive and cute. Good Job Yotel.
"Though the cabins are small, there were ample walking space due to their smart layout. The rooms with view was fantastic! We celebrated my husband's birthday there and the hotel very kindly sent Yolanda (their robot) up to our room and sang a birthday song for my husband before presenting him with some macaroons and a birthday card signed by all the staff of Yotel! Very impressive!"
"Fast check in nice room and nice scennert, The room has many space saving features but albeit a little tiny. The view from my room with the city view was fantasttic and was able to get a good view of the southern singapore"
"Conveniently located beside orchard Shaw centre and 2 minutes walk to Orchard Isetan, Tang studio, ION, Wisma & Takashimaya. You can do your shopping or dining in orchard road or take bus / Mrt to anywhere you would like to travel in Singapore"
"Perfect place to unwind and relax. Highly recommended for couples for its convenience and space. Very smart way to save space and wasn't too congested. Breakfast menu has been enhanced and it was a good move. Body lotion needs some work. Some noise from the pipe during the night. Otherwise, perfect stay."
"Nice location which is near to the MRT station, cozy hotel room and clean. But it kinda a little bit small and the bed a little bit soft. It would be perfect if the room a  bit bigger and the bed a little bit harder."
"There for stay-cation and find that location is convenient.Good bird eye view from bathroom and toilet.Best of all,the room is clean and tidy. Food quality needs to improve especially their breakfast which is served cold"
"Yotel was great! Perfect for small families or couples. Location was great. Just behind shaw house. Room was clean, (I stayed on 24th floor) view was excellent. Only thing is Toilet door was frosted glass so could see into the toilet. No complains. Had a great stay!"
"Took the First Class Queen and loved the balcony and the view! The check in was seamless despite being the public holiday period and the check in staff was really friendly and polite. However, the bed was too soft so did not really sleep very well and also, should consider having non smoking balconies so those who cannot take second hand smoke can have the option of choosing that. If not, if the next door cabin guests smoke at their balcony, it will cause discomfort to those who do mind the second hand smoke."
Booked this hotel for a family staycation of 3 adults. Given the cabin room with bunk bed. Location is prime as in the heart of Orchard Shopping Belt.  Cabin room is well compacted but size is really too small for a family of 3 - very squeezy .
The price of the hotel and the service of the staff were fine. The rest of the stuff such as the cleanliness of the room and facilities were bad. Given 2 rooms but both were dusty. One of the rooms has plenty of insects. The bed was not comfortable and the pillow was too flat.
"I booked a room for three, with a bunk bed on top. The hotel room looks small in picture in Agoda, however it is bigger than I think. Well arrange & organize, especially the toilet, clean, comfy & quite big."
"Choosing a hotel has always been according to what you need for that specific period of stay. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were welcomed by a clean, quiet and sleek view of the lobby - self service kiosks on the left, robots on the right and service counters in front of us. The premium view bunk room is an experience, but slightly small for a 3 pax. Nonetheless, the high floor view on beside the bathroom/ toilet is certainly pleasing and satisfying. Don't forget to close the blinds before using though üòú"
"Will for sure recommand this hotel to my friends & relatives.I will come here again for my staycationü•∞ Easy assess to any shopping area, nice food surrounding & easy assess to any public transport as well."
"This was our first staycation since the pandemic started. We enjoyed our stay. The location is conveniently located just a stone's throw from Orchard MRT and the major shopping malls which line the area. I loved how simple the concept is. We felt safe throughout the check-in process. We loved the robots that delivered water to the room. It was my partner's birthday so it was a surprise when a robot delivered a birthday card for him. Absolutely would love to stay here again for a budget staycation in the Orchard area. Shop 'til you drop... into one of the rooms. Also, Komyuniti is a welcome surprise. Quiet ambiance. Great for a quiet date night. Kudos to the staff Vivian and those on their shift in early February... who were super friendly. Kudos to Yoshi and Yolanda, the"
I really like the adjustable bed and how comfortable it is. The view from the shower was nice too. Just that the aircon is not cold enough when we are sleeping and the swimming pool water is icy cold for me.
"With the floor to ceiling bathroom windows in their cabins, the shower experience at Yotel was probably the most memorable. Their cabins were very simple, functional and fulfil their brand promise of only focusing on providing the essentials. I slept well on their mattress. Though I have to say that service standards here are rather unremarkable. The purple lighting used around the property serves as quite a backdrop for the now necessary Instagram shot when on staycation. Check-in and out was quick and smooth without much hassle. Recommended if you are just looking for a self-sufficient, simple and value for money staycation experience in a time when leisure overseas travel is practically not possible."
"This is one of the best hotel I have stayed in Singapore.  Very cozy room, very clean and decent size bed.  It is centrally also located.  We had a fantastic view from our room.  Would definitely recommend Yotel."
Will come back again.  Location good  Nice to chill  Gym fantastic other than the cable machine still don‚Äôt have the handle .  Pool seems nice haven‚Äôt try . All come again to try.  Bed abit too soft due to wear and tear . But overall not bad
"For 3 guests, you couldn‚Äôt find a better hotel at this price for such a fantastic location. Right next door is the start of the shopping belt Orchard Road. However, bear in mind that the rooms are really small. The so-called room with a view is when you have to keep the toilet door opened then you are able to have a view. Once the toilet door is closed, it is really that‚Äôs it! A cabin!"
"Positives: Great location, good food and quiet room. Will be back for short staycation at the crossroad of Orchard and Scotts roads! Negatives: Mattress too soft for me and lack of storage in the room. Not suitable for the claustrophobics!"
Cheap and fantastic. Breakfast included for my package and it makes my staycation even more awesome. The design of the hotel is futuristic and something unlike the typical hotel. Definitely will go again.
"This is the 2nd hotel in Orchard Road that i have tried in 2021 and is newer than the other one i have tried.   Was given Room#2814. Despite room size is small, everything in the room is neat and tidy.  Given a nice city view in the toilet but don't forget to bring down the bind before you do your business. Room door is thick thus i did not hear any noise from the hotel corridor. Nice smart bed that you can adjust the angle while watching TV on bed. Water pressure from shower head is good but the only issue i have is the glass toilet door. If you are staying with another person you be able to see him/her sitting on toilet bowl, as the toilet door cannot be closed fully. There are gym and swimming pool at Level 10 but did not book any slot to try them.  Did not opt for breakfast"
"Clean and well maintained.hope to be back with friend in near future! Breakfast was awesome, staff are friendly.overall good experience. Check in and check out are smooth too, maybe is due to weekday."
"nice hotel in good location with shopping & food places nearby.  Small rooms but neat & clean. Except for the bed which personally is not my type for soft mattress, I would rate the hotel good for a short stay be it leisure or staycation.  I would recommend friends to try Yotel for a staycation."
My kids loved Yoshi and Yolanda very much. Only thing is that Yolanda sings a goodbye tune but Yoshi just say good bye. Thus its better to get the female robot to deliver items to the room. It was raining in the 3 days we stayed there thus the water in the swimming pool was cold. But that did not stop the kids from going into the pool when the rain stopped for a while. Overall the kids enjoyed themselves.
"Room was small upon first impression but the futuristic interior design was thought through, having smartbeds/tv to utilizing space very well (that a full-length ironing board could fit in without cramming the place). Full bottles of shampoo/conditioner etc were surprisingly provided instead of your typical small samples, and the toilet was so clean and cosy w a view of the cityscape and hot water (don't worry you can pull the blinds down for privacy when taking a dump).  YOSHI the robot was so cute and had a personality: It went, ""May the force be with you"" and ""Hasta La Vista, baby"". Didn't manage to meet YOLANDA though :( We had trouble trying to connect our device to the tv (it only streamed music and not videos??) so would be useful to have a thorough guide somewhere."
"I wrote my comments in the earlier section about the attentiveness to details such as housekeeping and check-in requests.  The location is perfect with its proximity to the station, variety of food and shopping needs."
"It was indeed a perfect staycation, thank you to the girl that assisted us on the check in day. We were very pleased by her welcome and good customer service.Thank you once again for the wonderful stay despite the pandemic period."
a little problem with the door lock but security fixed it immediately. very good service. love the location. Nice view. It has all the amenities provided. Only the bed too soft for me. Would be good if they provide hand towel at side or they missed out ?
"Staff were friendly and the stay was pleasant, with friendly and helpful staff. Room amenities were sufficient and the room was cozy and comfortable. We stayed for 2 nights in the room with bunk for 3 people, and spent a great time in the room. Would come back again!"
The staff of the hotel was friendly and respectful to all the guests. They tried their best to minimize the waiting time for check in. They are very responsive to their guests and tries to ensure a pleasant stay.
Rooms are comfortable and clean. Good location where public transport is right at your door stop. Walkable to most shopping malls in Orchard. Friendly service and love Yolanda and Yoshi. Highly recommend.
"I love the view, style and amenities of Yotel. Great location to access Orchard and train stations. When the hotel first opened the beds were in great condition, but recent visits shows the bed have sunken quite a bit. They missed out to replenish some amenities but were quick to recover after a call. As for their front liners, service seriously varies greatly from one another. The way they communicate COVID measures were not the most tactful. They have self-automated machines but at the end still require a staff to assist you or else end up diverting you to the counters, not a very smart check in after all."
"My husband and I booked a 3d2n stay to celebrate the New Year countdown to 2021. The room was very clean and I really liked the retractable bed. We had a high floor hence we had a good view of the orchard area surroundings. However, I think the design of the room is very bad/not soundproof as I could hear water flushing down the pipe whenever the guests above uses the toilet/bathe. It happened in the day and we thought nothing of it. However, we didn‚Äôt realised how loud it was that we got awaken up at 3am by the water flowing through the pipes and it lasted about an hour! (Like who bathes at 3am?!)  We called the guest services and the technician came down to explain they couldn‚Äôt do anything about it but thankfully enough they allowed us to have a late checkout since it"
"Had a staycay here recently, my friends and I enjoyed it very much! We booked the premium bunk bedroom and although the room is very small and doesn‚Äôt have much space to walk, it has everything that we need (and it‚Äôs cosy!) We can easily connect our laptop to the TV via hdmi and we love its HD quality!  Also, the hotel‚Äôs restaurant serves pretty decent food at reasonable prices. Will definitely return again in th future!"
"The hotel has all the amenities for a short stay, long stayers would be adviced to find some other property that can accomodate the space. Inventive with their storage and looks. Falls short on bed quality."
