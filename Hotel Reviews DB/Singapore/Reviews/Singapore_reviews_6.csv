"Had a wonderful experience staying at Orchard Hotel. Right from checking-in, to room service, everything was seamless. The room we stayed in was spotless and the malls we were able to reach in walking distance added to the great experience we had during our stay."
"Absolutely comfortable stay, the service staff were helpful and friendly. We had a stuck shower head and it was replaced quickly with just a call.   Checkout was instant too, and we can leave our luggage with the concierge while we head out for lunch."
"Place was clean, staff was friendly and helpful. Room was spacious. Overall a great value for money.   As for location, multiple convenient stores nearby, bus stop right in front of the hotel that is 2 stops away from the shopping belt of orchard."
"Check in to the room on 17th on a two days stay. Waiting time and process was smooth. Breakfast was great with good choice of variety. Was specially satisfied with one of front desk a lady with long hair and specs. Regret not getting her name to comment of her good services. While checking out, as i was with two luggages and one small one for my child. Was impressed when this lady rush over to inform one of the staff to help us with the load. This small gesture really brighten up our day and let visitors come back for staycation at the hotel.  thank you !"
Wonderful service from every department.  Check in and checkout was very smooth. Meals at the Cafe was also delicious. We had the Nasi Goreng... Delicious! A cafe staff even went the extra mile to give us a slice of cake for our anniversary. üíê Room service was also efficient eg when I requested for an extra pillow
"The hotel staffs are very friendly and helpful. We stayed in the Premier room, the room is good for the price. The bed is very comfortable. However, the bathroom floor can be quite slippery when wet. Do you will need to be careful when showering."
We were happy to get the premier family room stay at Orchard Hotel. Greeted warmly by the hotel staff at the entrance to the check out.  Very swift and no hassle.   Chooi Yan was helpful too.  Definitely one of my favourite hotel stay!!!   Children was very happy especially with the mini tent and swimming pool!
"My previous stay had been pleasant so i booked confidently this time around and even pre-paid for a month's stay (01-29 April 2021). I would come to regret this! As service was abysmal, i requested to shorten my stay but Hotel was not agreeable.  Check-in: ""Darren"" checked me in. Smooth process; minimal conversation = cold welcome! I offered my CC, he declined. I discovered later, when i met friends at the Orchard Cafe for drinks that i couldn't sign charges to my room. The Orchard Cafe lady informed me, ""You're not allowed to charge anything."" WOW!   Room:  Pros: Spacious. Cons: Dusty mirrors and counter areas. Air-con was not cold and sink had a water draining problem. Sink was boat-shaped in design; lovely to look at but not functional! Narrow part of sink is closest to tap;"
"Nicely renovated & Spacious. Indian Lady that assist with our check in was lovely unlike the chinese Lady next to her.  Now comes my unhappiness I have experience here at Orchard Hotel.  1st: Upon reaching the entrance of this hotel, We were greeted by this old malay bell man whom is so rude asking us to fill up the form b4 entering the hotel.  2nd: The pillow was flat even the comforter is higher. 3rd: The sofa bed makes a double bed half part of it keep on moving which is very irritating. It is hard too not comfortable to sleep on. 4th: Going in the swimming pool, the Indian pool attendant was using the hp while on duty I presume. when we came and ask us if we made a reservation n ask us if we screenshot the reservation, I have been to so many hotel in SG this the 1st time"
"Orchard Hotel has always been our favourite hotel for staycations. We‚Äôve also always recommended any family visiting Singapore to stay at Orchard, so we really take no pleasure in writing this review but hopefully it will help Orchard Hotel improve. On our last stay in November 2020, we noticed a slight decline in certain aspects of the hotel but needless to say, because of COVID-19 we kind of excused it away.   We initially booked two nights, then extended for the third night for our 9th year anniversary. We checked in at 4pm (check in‚Äôs are at 3pm) and was told that check out would be at 11am! (usually at 12pm) We think it‚Äôs just appalling that COVID-19 is used as an excuse to start short changing your customers.   We wouldn‚Äôt have mind it so much if the extra hour was used to"
"Had the opportunity to book a slot for check in but upon reaching, was told that the room wasn't going to be ready until 2hrs later. Felt that if this was the case I shouldn't have been allowed to book an early check in slot.   Nonetheless, we decided to try our luck 1hr later and they had an available room. This room seemed a bit dated and had certain deficiencies like a broken door and work out wallpaper. Called engineering to have it rectified but after they came they were unable to solve the door issue and suggested we change room.   The second room had much better decor and seemed newer. Overall experience was good given the price. Both rooms were the same size but the newer one appeared bigger as the toilet was smaller. However if we had stayed in the first room throughout"
"Room is spacious. Aircon is not cold throughout the night. Was warm at times.  Was expecting alot of amenities for a clubroom, but disappointed.  Couldn't increase volume on TV, as neighbouring room could hear, but it was still soft for us.  Breakfast is good and filling. Lucky never opt for buffet.  Well, as a whole, a good-average stay."
"My family and I had a 3D2N stay with Orchard Hotel during the March holiday and we totally enjoyed ourselves to the fullest!  Greeted instantly by the friendly bell uncles once the lift from the carpark opened to the hotel entrance already caught us by surprise!   I would like to give my utmost commendation to Front office staffs Kelly, Zoey and Yen for making our whole  process of checking in and out of the hotel seamlessly. You guys are warm, professional and efficient! Much better than many 5 stars hotels service in Singapore we have experienced! This could only be achieved when Front Office Assistant Manager Darren and Manger Quam are exemplary to the team and have lead them to the right direction.  We appreciate all the services rendered to us and THANK all the staffs who"
"I truly enjoyed my one night stay & i find it very relaxing. Since it was a off peak day, we had the whole pool to ourselves. Room was simple & classic where simplicity is at its best.  Pro: complimentary parking Con: late checkout latest at only 12 pm  But I wouldn‚Äôt mind booking this hotel again for my next stay. Thumbs up."
"My return visit to Orchard Hotel for a retreat. An advice: to book it on weekdays to maximum the pool/gym facilities and lesser check-in queue. The first visit was full of crowds due to weekends.   The front office team (Quam and Kenta) were extremely accommodating and allowed us to have a late checkout. So this was a big plus, especially that I checked in late at 6pm. Thoughtful sanitizer mobile device at the front desk counters for guests too! Many thanks to Quam for his meticulous and humble hospitality service.  There were some hiccups, the minibar fridge wasn‚Äôt cold, an ice bucket for $5++, room bathroom can be renovated, eg bath tub too small and rundown, and dust in the toilet.  Nonetheless, would definitely send a friend there and return for the reasonable room rates,"
"I was very impressed with the service accorded to my family and I when we stayed over at the hotel. Special mention to our bellman Santhanam for his fantastic service. He was very patient and assisted us greatly in carrying a great load of items from the ballroom to our room and subsequently, to our car during check out.  Ballroom coordinator Mun Ket and banquet director Haze was fantastic as well, their professionalism and dedication were key in making our wedding banquet a great success."
Overall stay is acceptable.  Positive : -booked premium 35m sq -fittings are new as newly renovated -pool size is standard ok -in the heart of orchard  Negative BUT can be improve overtime :  - missing covid pack  - pool booking is not inform during check in that require online pre booking (thanks to the security for letting in as still empty  Thou room is not ready when requested for early check in at 1100hrs..was advice to wait for another 1-1.5hrs and will be called once avail. Waited with no updates until checked within 1hrs and was given the room keys. Staffs are friendly...  Take note: -best to prebook your early check in online -long Q to be expected during check in (3pm onwards) due to the overwhelm esp during this covid period
"I have nothing but praise for this hotel, and especially one of its employees Sharron Tan who was everything the Hospitality industry should be, kind, caring, helpful,  patient,  friendly and a consummate professional.  I had problems with my quarantine documents and she kindly helped me with them and with getting them printed.  The Hotel is impressive,  spacious lounges, good food in the Orchard Cafe, the staff attentive and good at their jobs. The room was very comfortable,  spacious and immaculate."
"And end to February, brought family for a Staycation and had booked 2 rooms which we got a corner ""Connection"" Door to 2 rooms. ( Photo Attached ) Kids had fun running from 1 room to other while not disturbing other rooms. Room was pleasant and comfortable  Had dinner at Hua Ting, their Peking Duck is still one of the best around !  Orchard Cafe was our Breakfast destination which was served to our table where we had a choice of Western or Asian plate. The Asian one was great ( Bee Hoon & Congee )"
"As mentioned by a recent review, someone mentioned that the premier room 35m2 doesnt look like 35m2 at all. From my personal stay twice with the hotel, Grand Deluxe room is 22m2, NOT 28m2. Got cheated by the 28m2 room size to book their grand deluxe room. As seen from my images, the walking gap is only the size of a pillow.. The walking gap, be it toilet to the cupboard, both sides of the bed to the wall, all are only the size of a pillow. If you have two person walking, you would have to walk like a crab.  Stayed at Orchard hotel earlier on this year, spending $151 per night. Was allocated a corner room. The corner room was even worst, the size is even smaller than the middle room. I have spoken to the reception, and was given another room (which is at the middle floor, which"
"Had a smooth staycation with Orchard hotel. I was suppose to stay in Deluxe room but the staff, Kent was kind and initiate to upgrade to Premier room. Many thanks to him; I enjoyed the room facilities even though it‚Äôs only for one night.  Overall, good service and easy accessible in town.    Looking forward to stay with Orchard hotel again :)"
"Our 6-month old baby had her first ever staycation at Orchard Hotel, and we have everything we need for this first experience with an infant.   The front desk counter's service was impeccable; the staff were hospitable and warm. They left a very good first impression of our stay. The service among the hotel staff were good as well, be it the housekeeping, security or other staff.  We stayed in a Premier King Room. While not the newest, it was spacious enough to place a cot beside our King Size Bed.   The location of the hotel meant we were never far from the major shopping centres and eateries, so food and transport was never an issue despite us not driving.   Would greatly recommend Orchard Hotel for all families with young children."
"Greeted with warm smiles the moment you enter the hotel for check-in.   Special thanks to staffs ChooiYen, Queenie, Nelson for making this birthday stay memorable & the team for the well wishes card + souvenirs.   - On the side note for improvement:   *Personally feel that the food selection was limited for breakfast. Breakfast experience 5/10.   *Musky smell. Any diffuser / aroma scent in the room would be nice!   -  Overall experience: Enjoyable!"
"Sincere thanks and compliments to Chooi Yen and Queenie for the excellent service. Their attention to detail as we made a mistake in our booking and effort to provide service beyond their duties is remarkable. The extra mile to explain the facilities  in the property and a little cake for a simple birthday made us really welcomed!  Not forgetting that even when masked up, they ‚Äúsmiled‚Äù with their eyes. What makes a stay memorable besides comfort is definitely being well taken care of by true hospitality heros! Appreciate your services and many blessings!"
"Many hotels have struggled to maintain service consistency, even the big brands, but Orchard Hotel had managed to attain a consistent level of good service. All service staff are friendly and helpful. Breakfast at the cafe was especially enjoyable and the Asian menu was tasty. Rooms are very comfortable and clean."
"Stayed 2 nights during 2021 Chinese New Year at this hotel.  This was our family 5th Chinese New Year staycation at Orchard Hotel.  This year was much quieter, as lions dance and dragon dance were not allowed.  However, it was still a good stay.  Everything was so familiar, since we have already stayed here several times.  We were given a room overlooking the Orchard Road, and a full view of the swimming pool.  So it was a nice room with good view.  Room was spacious enough for an extra bed.  Although the room was not very big, it was cosy.  Breakfast was served at Orchard Cafe.  There were only 4 or 5 main set we can order for breakfast, besides the beverages, cereals etc.  The western set was better, as compared to the Oriental set where the portion was not so much.  The"
It's was such disappointing to discovered that my bedsheets was sticking a single hair of someone's. As after I checked in to the room 1220 less than 30 minutes on 3rd March 2021. At once I call the operator. Less than 10 minutes a Chinese lady arrived to my room. As I showed her the hair. She still can ask me wanna change new bedsheets or not... really kind of extra foolish question. As she changes it after my answer is Yes. After all its my 1st time to choose staying this hotel. For such simple mistake. it's really gave me kind of feeling I won't want to recommend my contacts to consider choosing this hotel for rooms check-in. It's kind of very sensitive issues for this Covid 19 period that my sleeping bedsheets that have someone's hair left over.
"We wouldn‚Äôt have thought to have held our wedding at any other venue than the newly renovated, beautiful and grandiose Orchard Hotel Ballroom. Equipped with a highly updated sound and lighting system, coupled with 2 huge LED screens, the ballroom is set to be a dream venue for any couple out there.  But the most important feature which actually made our wedding experience an unforgettable one was the staff of Orchard hotel. From day one of the ballroom viewing, to the food tasting and the wedding day itself and at checkout, Haze and Mun Kiat who were the sales and operations personnel attached to us, ensured that our every need is attended to. No stone was left unturned. They, together with the banquet staff during the wedding reception really bend (bent?) their back backwards"
"We stayed at the orchid hotel mumbai for 1night had a very great experience.....we visited vindhys for breakfast we just loved that place....authentic food and presente staff ...,very well experience relly loved it lot thnk you jayni,mahesh for taking care of us"
Receptionist Miuccia & Amanda was very helpful. I booked a total of 4 rooms. They assigned the rooms prior to my arrival date with my request connecting and nearby each other. Complimentary early check in & late check out was given :)  Another thing I'm disappointed that room service starting to charge guest for a bucket of ice @ $5. We had to buy a packet of ice from the nearest 7-Eleven located at Orchard Tower.   Breakfast please try to avoid busy period between 09:15-09:30 queue was pretty long until the reception we almost waited for 20 minutes before entering the restaurant.
"Suppose to have an 3days2night,staycation at orchard hotel.Wanted to try since last time used to work beside them.Due to last min changes i try another hotel instead.But definitely will be back soon.Just casually made an remark about my plan of changing. Their duty manager Nelson Wang ""quite cute when he smile"":),very professional and check with me for feedback on their services.üëçüèª"
"Many thanks again to Yen, the front desk crew and concierge at Orchard Hotel for the wonderful accommodation during the Lunar New Year and Valentines Day weekend. Definitely looking forward to our next stay at our usual room on level 12. Many thanks from the Tan's ‚ù§Ô∏è"
We have a good stay in the hotel. Very personal welcome from front desk. Would like to specially thank Kent for his customer support during our stay there.  He helped us to resolve matter quickly and professionally. Thank you so much! We will definitely come back again and recommend our family and friends!
Could feel the CNY festive. Greay feeling that Hallal food served during breakfast. Cafe staff was so polite and frendly. Conceige staff Azran n Sant Hanan was frendly too. Staycation was worth and will definately suport local hotel on future.
Good service friendly staff helpful and the room is big for three adult in one room near by the mrt at orchard during the covid 19 the breakfast not the buffet type but they serve it to u no need by yourself
"The room was great and tiptop, have smoking room and that is the most important part, very clean except there no bathtub in my room and no view. i will stay in again next time but will request for bathtubü§£"
"Had to wait for a room till 5pm when check in was at 3pm, went into the room and the TV was not working. Called for a technician and came back after dinner to a toilet full of cigarette fumes. While the response was appropriate it took a substantial amount of time. Went for breakfast but was told to go up and change out of my clothes because they were ‚Äúinappropriate‚Äù - bear in mind my clothes covered me from head to toe, exposing nothing. Went up to change and to my horror the staff let a lady in spaghetti straps and fbt shorts in. Katherine/Catherine, one of the female managers in the khaki jacket was the one who made me go up to my room to change. During breakfast, in order to not create more wastage than necessary, we told Catherine that we would like eggs without the full"
"Staff attitude was so horrible! This is so shocking coming from a 5 star hotel. Not recommended at all. The description of the room says that the room size is 35m2, I was a bit doubtful, so I went to check at the reception, and I was received horribly.   Good location. Room is nice and cozy."
"Check in was smooth and room is spacious, clean, bed very comfortable. All staff was friendly especially the lady who cleaned my room.Overall, we enjoyed the stay and will recommend our friends to try Orchard Hotel."
"I‚Äôm so disappointed with the service especially the staff at the front desk. I could still remember his name , Kent. When we were checking in , we were not greeted. We don‚Äôt feel welcomed. It ruined our day. I was so upset. Overall room was okay but hope they‚Äôll improve their customer service."
"Having stayed here several times, the service is on the downfall. The communication is very bad.  I had emailed the hotel 4 times and wrote on their FB with no reply on my lost and found item. It's very frustrating. I only get the reply after check in by calling the service hotline.   Secondly, regretted my choice of taking up their signature room. The room is so cramp with bulky furniture, black woods, very tiny window and bathroom. Found the table lamp on the floor. Pretty creepy feeling. Not recommended. My last stay in a premier room was amazing.   Next, the security is very bad. I had a rude knock on my door at 4am. When i peep to the hole It was friend. He  had return to get his house key left in my room. The receptionist had given him the acess key to my room. I was dumb"
Had a birthday surprise held at Orchard Hotel and the male receptionist was really accommodating and helpful with the execution. Excellent service and location! Amenities were clean as well! Highly recommended!
"Had a short staycaytion with my family recently. Good experience, seems like there was a renovation and the interior decor was quite new. Counter staff and main entrance staff were very polite and helpful, always with a smile. The room was very small though,"
"I stay at this hotel around month for business trip, the location of hotel is good, close the popular shopping mall on orchard road. I must to say that Mrs Tina of Orchard Cafe give me a good and deep impression, every morning, she always provide warmest service. so i think next time when I have business trip again, I will still choose this hotel."
"Our company recently held our Full Day Strategic Planning at Orchard Hotel and had a great experience. Hotel is clean, location convenient and we treated in a first-class manner right from the start till the end. Food was beautifully plated and delicious. We especially want to thank the professional and warm services by Mr. Johnny Lim, Mr. Mun Keat (Banquet Department) and Ms. Elleen Wong and Ms. Florence Eng (Sales Department). We will highly recommend any company/organization looking for a venue to host their company event/party."
"Amazing place, convenient to access to mrt and shops nearby! Hotel is clean, staff is friendly, peaceful place too. The best part of it is there is an in-house movie! Able to watch Netflix when u connect using screen mirroring or by hdmi cable. This is my 2nd time staying in the hotel! thumbs upüòäüëç"
"We would like to have a moment to thank all the staff who has been accommodating on our request for the entire stay. From the reservation team Miss Ida, frontdesk agent Mr kenta and the bellman Mr santhanam and Mohd. Excellent service provider from these individual. We would definitely have Orchard Hotel as one of our frequent visit in the future."
"Great and excellent services from Mr Mohd the bellman! Will sure recommend orchard hotel to my friends! I had my wedding near the hotel and throughout my stay in the hotel, it was very heartwarming and calming experience from all the hotel employees and also from Mr Kente and Mr Santhanam üíñü•∞"
"All staff are efficient and friendlyüëç.  First time stayed at Orchard Hotel and we really enjoyed our stay. Definately will come back again for our staycaytionüòç.   We wanna extend our apology to the room service gentleman for troubling him. First we request for wine opener and forgotten to request the wine glass at the same time. When he came up to open the wine bottle,he noticed that we have no wine glass so he asked if we need it and he can deliver the glasses(that is really a nice gesture from himü§©). He have to make his way twice to our room,troubling him. A BIG thank you for your pleasant service!(Forgot to get his name).  Overall,we are very happy with everything!!"
"My wife and I spent our anniversary with them. Overall experience was quite a pleasant one. They even prepared a cake for us for the occasion which we thought it was a pretty nice gesture.   Two particular things to point out:   1. We were greeted by Chooi Yen (hope I spelt her name correctly) when checking into the hotel. She is polite and very professional. Took time to explain to us on some queries we had. Got us checked-in to our clean and tidy room ahead of time.  2. Our breakfast unfortunately took awhile before they were served and only after reminding the staff of our order. Not even our latte was served prior the the reminder. And they have totally forgotten our cereal + milk and yogurt. (Not served at all) American breakfast set was quite a disappointment. IMO, the"
"I made a reservation via Hotel.com platform at this property on 05th Jan for tonight. It is for a very special occasions (18th year wedding anniversary, my daughter passed her O Levels and got admitted to polytechnic and her birthday is actually today - 15th Jan). Prior to our checking in, I made a phone call to the property to request for some special arrangements. I was then informed to make my request thru email to enquiry.ohs@millenniumhotels.com. A lady by the name of Kelly replied to me on 12th Jan about the cakes and pralines as an arrangement (sorry to say but these are so yesteryears. We did that in St Regis in 2014.) So I then called and spoke to Lynn on the same day around 4pm. She said that I would need to reply the email and enquire about the flowers. If I agree"
"Room was clean, all service staffs were polite, helpful and hospitable. I could not has asked for a better staycation experience. Was there for a training and the food they served for our lunch was great! It did not felt like a training, but instead felt like I was dining in an expensive restaurant with a 3 course cuisine. Special mention to Perlin, Elleen and Mun Ket for your hard work to make the whole experience great!"
"Great cleanliness, food and even better service from the staff. Conducive environment for my team and i to do our annual planning conference, had a really good time of bonding with them as well. Grateful to the Hotel and will be coming back here for personal stays in the future!"
A huge thank you to the staff at Orchard Hotel who looked after me and my colleagues during our recent visit. We had most of our meals as working meals and the staff were so on-the-ball which made all our transitions from break to work (and vice versa) seamless and fuss-free. They were so helpful and cheerful as well which made for a very pleasant experience overall.
Amazing service by each and every member of the staff from the service staff to the organizers. Special shout out to Perlin Chan that coordinated everything and was instrumental to making our event a resounding success.
My team and I had a great stay at orchard hotel for our annual planning conference. The staffs were friendly and accommodating. The ballroom was spacious and the lunch and dinner menu was good as well. special thanks to pearlin and kevin for helping us and ensuring everything goes smoothly during our time there! would definitely recommend this hotel for our future conferences and staycation.
"We had a great time staying in this hotel for our honeymoon. The breakfast spread are good and especially the Afternoon tea. One of the most enjoyable experience. My daughter loves the swimming pool and jacuzzi.    Friendly and helpful staffs. Checking in was fast as we need to change for our outfit for the photoshoot.  The staffs are indeed experienced and professional.  Special thanks to the security officer, Ella for helping us with our safe box and also guiding us to eatery near the premises.   Would definitely consider this place for our next staycation."
"I can't remember exact time frame but I did make an inquiry from Facebook postings of the affected hotel, offering special in-house stay package.  Today itself received a personal call from staff by the named of Ms Serafhina updating me with latest special stay packages.  Such interactive and prompt response from hotel staff already provided the assurance in securing future stay with the hotel, and certainly looking forward to have the most memorable stay and hopefully able to enjoy and appreciate the most exemplary services offered. Congrats to Staff Ms Serafhina (hopefully I got your name correctly spelled out), as half of the service excellence battle had been secured by your ingenious tele-marketing skills.  Certainly looking forward to meet you in person in my upcoming stay"
Spacious room with 1 King and 1 queen sofa bed. Decent breakfast options. Staffs are friendly and covid measure in place such as maintaining 15 pax at pool.   We enjoyed our stay and definitely looking forward our next staycation there.
I was happy with the services. I opt for anniversary cake and they given me the best and with a cute card. It made my day and honestly this is isnt my first time. Been here somewhere in year 2015. Keep up the best service
Room is great. Bed is comfortable. Wifi is strong. Ask for high floor for nice view of the city. Location is great as it is within walking distance to Orchard Road. Check in is fast and hotel guest relations office Ken Tan is great!
Was switch to Orchard hotel from Grand waterfront Copthorne last min but was wonderfully served by counter service Darren whom took the trouble to change a few things for the rooms allocated to us to the best of our benefit. And also Mr Kalai the electrician whom came to our rescues for my boy‚Äôs bubble gun! His first ever.  Overall a good stay and experience!! Keep it up!
"I had check in for stay cation, It was wonderful. Most of them is very friendly,Check in was smooth with staggered check in time.Special thanks for Zoey who make my stay cation best  Also manage to get a late check out"
"Check-in was great was serve by f/o agent Zoey very accommodating on our request to get connecting as the booking was for two rooms.   Order in-room dining for a meal of Fish&Chips took 2hours to come , understandable as it was NYE however no service recovery was made the waiter just left the food on the floor outside the door.  Stay was very pleasant, Hskp staff was fast on the delivery of water bottles.   Checkout was served by a lobby ambassador ""fast checkout"" .  Carpark was alittle dull and lots were limited."
Cleanliness was compromised during the New Year‚Äôs celebration. The room number is 1149 and it was not properly cleaned. When i checked in and opened the curtains there was a sticker hasn‚Äôt removed from the window.  There‚Äôs a hardened rice on the table. There‚Äôs a couple of chips left inside the drawer. Opened tea on the drawer. And when i looked at the peep hole there were tissues inserted in it. I called the reception around 3:45 as soon as i saw these things and told about the situation she informed me that they will get back to us for the room change. We waited and waited we already settled in the room despite the said complaints. They called us for a rooM change around 8:30 having an excuse of they attended another room change. Ofcourse you wouldn‚Äôt want to change room
"Check in was relatively smooth with the staggered check-in timings as I opted for the 12pm slot. Booked a premium club room at a higher cost but there is no club lounge for use. Disappointed that the hotel did not share about the renovation of the club lounge when I emailed prior to the stay and also on check-in and we only knew of it when we checked out the club lounge on our own. Due to closure, there is no happy hour for the club guests and we could have just booked for a premium room with no additional cost."
"Very disappointed. I called the first and second time and no one picked up the phone. Third time, I tried to call and I wanted to asked info on your breakfast as we wanted to book a table for 4, since my husband loudly mentioned about the lovely experience he had not long ago. The lady on the phone rudely interrupted me and did not help at all. She simply stated ""you need to speak with the cafe"" (not in a nice way, almost like she was fed up or she didn't want to spend time over the phone) and she addressed my call to the cafe without even mentioning to me ""I will put you on hold"" or similar. I would have expected a mininun of courtesy. Very  rude of her to hang up on me without notice. When transferred to the cafe, I spent I don't know how many minutes waiting as nobody picked"
"We booked 2 connecting rooms. Check in queue was short as we arrived around 1pm. Did the necessary admin and was told that only one room is ready which wasn't an issue for us. We went out and collected the keys to the other room when we came back later that evening.   The hotel is located at the end of Orchard Road but it is not a very long walk to the main shopping belt. Thankfully, the clubs are not open due to COVID, otherwise, we think there will be a bit of noise on a Friday night.  Room is comfortable and clean. It looks newly renovated and modern. TV had lots of channels.   Breakfast - you choose the cuisine that you want. The portion is huge so never mind that it wasn't a buffet. Other tables had quite a lot of leftover food, which is a shame as all these will go to"
"Checked in on 30th Dec and was allocated Room #1228 as i have booked a Grand Deluxe Queen room. The room is smaller than what i was expecting. The photo in Agoda website showing a sofa but ended up just a cushion chair, didn't wanna make a fuss of it as only a night stay. Wardrobe is dusty under the interior light. The management need to improve the flushing system of the toilet bowl, need multiple flushings to clear the waste fully. Handheld shower was dislodged thus water flushing out at the joint when i turn it on. Am surprised that housekeeping staff did not discover that. I managed to fix that myself so i can use it. My room has a japanese style square bathtub that i did not expect to have.  Check-in was smooth at 1.30pm and counter staff was helpful. Breakfast was average."
"The staff atOrchard Hotel were friendly and approachable. However , the Premium Club room was a let down. My husband n I felt so short change over the amount  we paid for our yacht-cation. It cost us $1750 exclude GST  The high tea collection (pic attached ) was ok but the amount given is really ... . In fact , we asked if there was more, the manager in charge came to explain that he actually made a very nice combination for us n that was it. I couldn‚Äôt dare to break his heart that the portion was not extravagant . However, I asked for a sandwich which the manager readily obliged with a cheery heart.  Dinner at Hua Ting - It was a set dinner. The meat platter and soup were delicious. Following these 2 dishes , it was mediocre. The dessert mango w Pomelo was extremely sweet. It‚Äôs"
"We checked in on 27th, booked their grand deluxe queen.. Didn't expect the room to be really really small, with a low ceiling. Feels so cramp staying in this room. Nicely renovated interior but room is really dusty, mirror full of dust, sofa & chair stains everywhere. It's really disgusting. We got room #906, corner one with city view. Hotel location is far end of orchard, have to walk a bit out.  Checking in waiting time is not that bad, had to wait around 20mins before we reach to the front counter. Friendly counter staff, complimentary parking ticket. Non-halal restaurant."
I am utterly disappointed with the standard provided by their level. They should be one star lesser than stated for those who are still deciding please read and consider. Never bother about distancing. 10 pax was allowed even before phase 3. This will be forwarded to the relevant department. No one bothers about your concern. Signature deluxe is crap. Even standard stuffs are short. Door security ledge missing. No room make up. Even plates and rubbish out rooms wasn‚Äôt clear for 2 days!!! Nothing is make up. Book and find out yourself.
"My family and I have booked a one night stay in Orchard hotel on 24 Dec for Christmas celebration. As we have 3 kids and an infant staying with us, we have requested for an adjoining Premier Club room and the hotel staff has accomdated to our request. We had pre-booked online a check-in time slot, but we still need to wait for about 30mins. The check-in process was smooth and we were presented with two Christmas hampers, it come along with the Premier club room booking.   The Premier club room type that we booked apparently provided us with free breakfast and high-tea. Upon check-in we went to The Orchard Cafe for high-tea. The cakes and pastries were so-so, but i must praised that the staffs were really attentive! The high tea was supposed to serve 4, however they have provided"
"Thumbs up for the great service by the front desk staff, Mr Steven. Upon knowing that my husband and I were there for our 21st wedding anniversary, he upgraded us to a club room which was very spacious and comfortable. They even gave us a slice of cake and a card which was very delightful. Overall, it was a great staycation and will definitely visit again!"
"I would like to give credit to Mr. Kalai who helped me to unlock my lugguage bag without causing a damage. Once the front desk staff told him about my lugguage bag problem, he came with me to my room to sort out the problem immediately. From the moment he stepped into my room until he left was less than 5 minutes. And before he used his tool to helped me to open the lugguage bag, he told me what he is going to do and what kind of precaution I have to take after opening the lock. He is just an expert!!"
"Stayed at Orchard Hotel over the weekend. Chose this hotel due to its location at Orchard District, so my nieces can experience the nice Christmas Deco along Orchard Road, as well as malls that competes to outdo one another (it is not so apparent compared to decades ago which was a mega Christmas event).   Due to the Rediscover voucher issued by Singapore Government, most of the hotels surged in bookings and many were not prepared operationally and logistically causing long queues formed at reception and huge delays.   We booked 2 rooms and we arrived slightly earlier but my room wasn't available, fortunately the other one was ready. Soon after, the queue has started to form due to many arrivals on the same day.   It was reported that the Registration queue at another hotel at"
"This was a last minute (1 week ago) staycation for stay on 18-19dec 2020. Although there was no pre-booked check in time slot but we were able to check in at 2pm on arrival date. No late check out was granted as the hotel was fully booked. The hotel managed the counter check in situation well with quite a number of staff there ensuring there were no long queues and they will pass us some forms to fill in our particulars first while waiting, so that check in will be faster later on.  We were assigned the grand deluxe twin room 1319 at the orchard wing and the recently refurbised room looks really in a good condition. We were spoilt by the number of charging points available, including 4 USB outlets. It was also a pleasant surprise when the hotel staff personally delivered the"
"Stayed 10th and 11th of Dec 2020. Very clean and good service but check the bill before check out one chicken rice added to my room service wrongly, but hotel informed me to investigate and reply where went wrong till date no reply   Check in process very long becuase of COVOD - 29 situation but automation in check in much much needed"
"Got the chance to have an overnight staycation here. The room has a green scenery view lookout, without any tall building in front.  I believe many people also come here for their bathtub. I just felt it was a bit small but still able to move around in the shower and toilet.  Unfortunately the shower water took sometimes to heat up, and you probably waste lots of water while waiting for the hot water.  As for the breakfast, because of the pandemic so all are serve in set meal. I ordered the western breakfast but it was served cold, even for the bacon and scrambled egg. Would be good if the food are as least warm."
"We stayed three nights as a family of four which included two young kids. The room we reserved was a Family Room but we were finally actually given two interconnecting rooms at check-in. That was a nice surprise, and we benefited from the added privacy between adults and kids. There was a king-sized bed in the adults room, and two super-single beds in the kids‚Äô room. The beds were on rollers though, so they shift position fairly easily.  We had complimentary parking. For persons who're driving, the turn from Claymore Road into the carpark can be a little hard to miss. Basically, turn from Orchard Road and right after you pass Claymore Connect on your left, turn left right away into the sideroad ‚Äì the entrance into the Hotel‚Äôs basement carpark is about 50 meters away.  After the"
"Went with the family on a 2D1N yachtcation purchased from the hotel. The package included - 2PM check-in - 2D1N stay in a Premier Suite at Orchard Hotel - 1 Hi-tea - 1 5-course Chinese dinner at Hua Ting - 4-hr Cruise on the Leviathan in Southern Islands - Picnic Lunch - Late check-out at 6PM  The kids enjoyed the experience. After the dinner, we need to walk around Orchard Road to work it off. The cruise to the Southern Islands was very pleasant, and it was surprisingly sunny. The day before and after was drizzling. During the cruise, we had a chance to swim, do some snorkeling (the usual low visibility in Singapor) and kayaking. We departed from the cruise at about 2PM and we had time to chill at the hotel pool before our late check-out. We took a stroll to the nearby Muddy"
"Thank you Mr Kalai from the engineering/IT department for helping us with the batteries and DM Nelson for the amazing service, really appreciate it. Thank you for being so nice and taking care of all our needs!!!!! :)"
"The Orchard Hotel is strategically located just at the end of Orchard Road, away from the hustle and bustle of the main shopping street but still well placed a short stroll away from the key shopping foci (e.g. Tangs, Isetan and Marks & Spencers). In the other direction, the glorious pleasures of the Botanic Gardens and Tanglin Mall beckon. Checking in one day after the infamous ""stayqueuetion"" episode, check-in was busy but moving, and staff were very proactive about getting information registered while waiting in the queue. This trend continued throughout the stay - morning breakfast service was busy but staff were pleasant and helpful. The premium signature rooms are located on the top floors of the hotel, and decorated in what looks like traditional Chinese decor, which"
"We were already impressed when greeted by friendly staff at the entrance. Early check in was a breeze for us. Clean rooms, super comfortable beds and hotel provide adequate amenities.  Breakfast was serve fast enough eventhough they were full house."
Orchard hotel exceed our expectation in every aspects. Decent room size with cosy ambience. Staff are very friendly and helpful-front desk & restaurant. We truly enjoy our staycation! Thank you for the amazing hospitality! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
"It seems like orchard hotel is not ready to operate yet, $200 plus per night is not cheap compare to other hotels in Singapore with nice service and facilities too. During our stay twas very difficult to reach ‚ÄúDial 0‚Äù. One more thing I understand the pandemic but Gym facility procedure was so troublesome to think that they have they‚Äôre own gym receptionist, but you still need to queue at the lobby to get gym access card before you able to use the gym, we, as a guest avoiding the crowd but we still need to queue at the lobby. Another worst thing was, after we check in, I was planning to make a coffee from their mini bar, I was shocked when I saw the mug was already used and there‚Äôs a coffee stain in it with the teaspoon üò∞I hope they will improve it after all the issue of"
"Stayed 2 nights.  -Room for improvement-  Club benefits only have afternoon tea, no evening cocktails with hor d'oeuvres . Afternoon tea was simple, nothing special. Went for first day and decided to skip it on second day as it wasnt very attractive. Not worth to upgrade with Club benefits.  Limited TV channels, does not have Mio Stadium.For soccer fans that want to watch EPL over weekend staycation do take note.  Breakfast serving was messy with charred bread served on Sunday morning. Order came incomplete or incorrect. Many reminders required to get the correct order. More organised on Monday morning with smaller crowd. Same options given for Daily Breakfast. Not worth to upgrade stay with breakfast.  Mini Bar area is dusty.  Limited items on Mini Bar. Fridge is empty.  -Areas"
Awesome hotel with friendly staff! Will sure to visit here again. Room was splendid & big enough for 2 person. Room & bathroom is extremely clean.good stay for family during this covid period to ease the mood.
The hotel rooms are clean and comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We had a very enjoyable stay. We also enjoyed going on the yatch and playing with the mat and the canoe. Thank you very much for the memories
Hotel front desk staff very observantly noted that it was my child's birthday on the day of our checkout and arranged for a cake to be delivered the day before our check out. Thank you for great service!
"Excellent location and affordable spacious club rooms. Believe it or not, my husband and I have been staying here for the past 5 weekends straight. Many more stays to come, definitely. And many thanks to the front desk team for the heartwarming stay ‚ù§"
"I have a staycation package ""Romantic Indulgence"" with my partner on November 2020, I was served by the Guest Experience Manager Chin Chooi Yen.  I would like to commend Yen on her warm hospitality and her kind attitude towards her customer. My partner and I felt welcomed and was impressed by her excellent services and follow ups from checking in the hotel, pool side dinner, next day delivery of the breakfast and to checking out. It is well planned and managed. She explains all the required information accurately and is very detailed.   Orchard Hotel had left me with a very good experience and impression. My partner and I had a memorable and romantic dinner by the pool with the surprise birthday cake. I will certainly choose Orchard Hotel again for future opportunities and stays."
"It must be embarrassing to only offer a WiFi speed of 25-28 Mbps in the year 2020... especially in Singapooooore...lame  Laundry, works very good. Room service, no issues. Staff, very helpful and service minded."
"I‚Äôve stayed in the hotel for 3D2N and I'm disappointed with the hotel. Firstly, in terms of cleanliness, I'm flabbergasted to see the cleanliness of the room was not up to standard. The housekeeper didn't clean the room thoroughly from the last user that occupied the room as there were trash still in the room (as shown in the picture below). I questioned if they did sanitized the room. Secondly, I requested for a king bed but was given 2  beds conjunct together instead. I wish it was stated during the booking or at the counter during check in.   I hope the hotel could have look at improving the service standards and the importance of cleanliness, especially during this covid period."
"Special thanks to Zoey for her hospitality and helpfulness, both at check-in and check-out! The room she provided was spacious, modern, comfortable and calm - perfect for a staycation. Also loved the beautiful holiday decorations and Christmas music in the lobby area. Definitely looking forward to another stay soon!"
"I would like to compliment Ms Farah Vierra (Assistant Reservations Manager) and Ms Perlin Chan (Sales Manager) for assisting me for the Yacht-cation Escape to suprised my friend's 30th birthday. Due to pandemic, the only option is to do a surprise staycation. So i was glad that Millienium Hotels and Resorts are offering a Yacht-cation Escape package where you can have a 1 night stay in the Premier Suite and a yacht experience. Both Ms Farah Vierra and Ms Perlin Chan assisted me with my queries and they planned for the 2D1N itinerary. They are very helpful and i really appreciate their help and patience. And also i would like to compliment Ms Chooi Yen (Front Desk) for a very friendly welcome. All of the Orchard Hotel Staffs are very friendly. The service was a tip top. A great"
"We booked for the 2D1N Yacht-cation and felt it was the most value for money package for a thoroughly enjoyable time with Orchard hotel. Excellent service, beautiful room, stellar dinner at Hua Ting and a thrilling experience on the Yacht ride out to see Singapore‚Äôs marina and visit the smaller islands surrounding Singapore. Truly took us on a ‚Äòholiday‚Äô outside of singapore without even leaving the country. Highly recommend!"
stayed at the hotel for 2 night and it was awesome. Very nice deco at the lobby and the staff are all very nice and welcoming. Just hope the hotel restaurant can be halal for muslim guest. So it will be more convenient for muslim guest to eat at the hotel.
"Wonderful 5-star experience during our 3d2n stay at Orchard hotel/ Yacht experience. It was our second time here. Location is great, nice 20mins walk to Botanic gardens and 10mins walk to Orchard road beautiful shopping beltway. Signature Mango cake at the cafe is my favorite.   Top of the world customer service from Chooi Yen (Front desk Concierge Manager) and Raymond Chiu (F&B Manager).   Wonderful first time experience for my kids on-board a Yacht operated by Daniel Ong/co. from JD Yacht Services. Friendly, experience and very knowledgeable pair of ex-naval divers.  Will come back again."
"Stayed here for quarantine, would not recommend for anything, and especially not staycations. Totally does not look like pictures! I've stayed in a lot of hotels the last 2 months and this was by far the worst. Even smaller than what I stayed in in Europe (does not even have a sofa! I felt quite claustrophobic being in there 2 weeks) and room is dated in spite of supposed recent refurbishment. I suspect they included the size of the long corridor in the room size, but it's not like anyone hangs out in the corridor. If anything it's an inconvenience.¬† Toilet smelled even on day 1. AC does not go above 25C so if you're cold you have no choice. Asked for help, they sent a technician down who told me switch on all the lights, as light emits heat... seriously... Front desk doesn't"
