"Booked rooms for 2d1n for a family staycay to celebrate birthday.  Staff was all well trained and friendly. Especially, Jenny at the entry of the infinity pool, lifeguard James - one of us was not feeling well after staying under the hot sun for an hour more, he immediately came to assist by bringing us chair and necessary actions was taken, even the PAD lady, Serene offered us some help and in a while we were escorted back to our room with the help of 2 security (didn't managed to get their name). Really thankful and grateful.  The only downside was the lobby staff was too strict and caused inconvenience. Because we had many rooms, so we kind of mixed up who was staying at which room, the rooms cards were mixed up as well and the details we provided wasn't matched at first and"
A wonderful staycation done at MBS. Got a free upgrade . Quick check in. Unfortunately bad weather restricted use of the Infiniti pool but still that‚Äôs an awesome experience. Would want to go into the pool again and book the room only to experience it! Lovely rooms. Wonderful cuisine at the convention center ... overall a wonderful staycation experience
"Did a 2 night staycation in the orchid suite. Got personally greeted on arrival and checked in at quiet lounge. Room was GIANT with spectacular view of the city from level 52. Access to choice of restaurants and club lounges for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canap√©s and drinks was fabulous treat plus daily surprise food gifts delivered to our door. Staff are just so nice and friendly top to bottom. Selfie in the pool is a must - one to tick off the bucket list."
"What more can you ask for than sitting on top of an infinity pool on top of the world? well besides that the hotel is spectacular in every sense from service, to food to character to all the amenities."
"My sister were staying as a family. They had so much issues with the hotel. They went out for day and when we came back to the hotel for the kid‚Äôs afternoon nap. The hotel did not allow us to go up to the room because we had 3 adults and 2 kids (2 years old and 8 months old). Please note that we were told that we can have 3 adults and 2 kids in the room. They made them stood in the lobby waiting for the manager to come over to resolve this issue. They had to wait there with the kids who were very tired at that point. And even after 3 managers came the issue was not resolved.   On the second day, they did not allow the kids to go up to the room in the afternoon for a nap coz apparently they were not registered. But somehow on the first day they had no issue. I have no idea what"
We had a great staycation at the Marina Bay Sands. First time me and my sister have stayed here.   The pool was everything I imagine it was so beautiful and relaxing and we were really lucky with the weather. The food menu for the pool was a very reasonable price too.  Due to covid we did only get one hour pool slots a day which was very hard to book but it was actually worth it as it wasn‚Äôt too busy and we got a great bed and relaxing space.   The staff were very friendly. Thanks for Fitz for a lovely welcome in the morning for our 9.30qm pool slot.  We also got upgraded to which was amazing and the view was unbelievable and the room was huge with a nice relaxing bath room.  I definitely recommend going here as we had the best time. Thanks a lot !
"The recent COVID pandemic has given a chance to try out several hotels in Singapore for staycaytion and a short getaway from the hectic worklife. After staying in 70% of the hotels that are opened in Singapore during this pandemic, I conclude that Marina Bay Sands is one of the worst hotel offering below par service standards, rude and impatient staffs.  Staffs were rude, impatient during check-ins, giving attitude and do not display any form of professionalism while they are carrying the branding of MBS. We were rejected entry at the lift lobbies as our friend swapped our key card by mistake, and we were horrified by the attitude of the staff stationed there. Instead of initiating a help to check with his/her supervisor or the staff who managed our check in, she directly"
"Had our staycation last April 7-9 2021. I must say that it‚Äôs indeed relaxing and enjoyable! We were happy with the service provided starting from Guest Service Officer Chihiro, she made us felt welcome upon arrival. I would like to commend the service provided by the housekeeping and express service team as they are prompt in delivering our request comparing to the other hotels we had booked previously.  We stayed in Tower 2 L31, so far I can say the best among 3 towers as it have direct access to the Gym and nice pool access. As borders are still closed a getaway to MBS is definitely recommend!"
"Booked 2 rooms, and were upgraded to the club rooms. Rooms were clean, huge and have awesome views. Everything in the minibar was complimentary.  Pre-booked pool and check-in time. Check-in was seamless despite a crowd. Service staff was friendly. Breakfast was delicious. Would love to come back if price is good."
"My friend,who is a regular hotel guest at MBS,recommended me to upgrade to Club 55 for a memorable staycation at MBS. The Club 55 upgrade comes with exclusive priviledges and complimentary  amenities including breakfast,afternoon tea and evening beverages and canapes for two persons. The lunch menu was not much to write about. The dinner menu was more substantive. If you enjoy alcoholic drinks in a good setting,you will enjoy Club 55. Club 55 is the main venu for the lunch and dinner treats. If the place is full when you arrive,there are alternative venues to enjoy same food.The view on Level 55 is fantastic. Add the ambience and perfect service,one will feel the cost of upgrading to Club 55 is money well spent for all the ""extras"" Go for Club 55 the next time you stay at MBS."
"I would like to commend the staff of MBS for a very approachable attitude. Starting from the check in, the staff gave us an electronic queue number that we can check online so we don't need to wait in line. I find it very strategic and modern. When we reached our room, we are in awe of the room's ambiance and the view in the balcony is magnificent! The room is very clean and smells nice as well. Few minutes after we reached our room, the room services knocked to deliver our extra mattress. When I examine the room I found this awesome toilet. It's very huge! We just noticed one thing, the downside is, there is no bidet present in the toilet so it's quiet hard to you know, wash after you use the toilet. I hope the management would consider adding bidet inside the toilets"
"stayed in MBS for 4 days ‚Äî everything was great and there weren't many minus points at all!   check in was great ‚Äî sms booking slots, so smooth. managed to get a check in slot at 9am, and went in to my room IMMEDIATELY. I had this fear I was gonna wait till 3pm to get in my room. But thankfully it was ready. all these are thanks to Guest Check In officer - Nikkie. she is so sweet, accommodating and detailed.   Rooms ‚Äî got a room on the 36th floor, garden view was splendid. Was already looking forward to the morning sunrises üòç had a deep soaking tub which I heavily utilized for my relaxation. Thank god TV had screen mirroring and bluetooth function.   Housekeeping ‚Äî Special thanks to Xi Mei, for her friendliness and for attending to us all four days. She decorated my room with"
"Due to Covid19 travel restrictions,i was only left with the option for a staycation as a honeymoon option. its definitely a perfect choice !  let's start with check-in ; we were given timeslots (to reply via sms). we came a lil earlier than our timeslot but since it was not crowded,we managed to get our rooms in 15mins. i indicates in my booking that i was there for a honeymoon. at the last min,i asked if there were smoking rooms as we were assigned a non-smoking room. the staff was so sweet to accomodate to us by giving an upgrade and also smoking room.  we had the sky view room and the view is GORGEOUS & breathtaking,making us wanna stay in the room throughout. the room is also super spacious ! minibar was complimentary,and toiletries are top-notch ones.    overall,definitely"
"Tried to check in at 9.50pm as visitor at tower 3.. the staff there mentioned the counter is closed. So we walk to tower 1 to check in and they told us visitor cannot check in anymore even we are same family. WTH, Feeling unwelcome with their 5* hotel stupid rules... spoiled our holiday mood. Will not visit anymore!"
"Pretty good experience - room was spacious and comfortable, service was good, and of course the views from the top were great.  Only drawback was that this place is really busy. Feels very crowded in all the public areas. Would not be my ideal kind of place if I wanted somewhere relaxing for a weekend of peace."
"From the start, it‚Äôs a disaster.  My friend walked into the hotel with 2 toddlers, carrying a bag, large parcel and a cake, and although there were concierge staff standing around, I must conclude they must be visually challenged; as no one offered to assist.  The check-in process is designed to make guests feel as unwelcome as possible. Take a number to check-in like you would at an emergency room, wait around like idiots waiting to be called. Check in is slow and tedious, lacking in information unless we ask for it.  2 main guests and only up to 3 visitors. Only 2 guests can stay overnite: kind of like I‚Äôm a hospital.  Check in staff,Devi, refused to register our guests in during the check in process and just told us to proceed to the lifts with our keycards.  When we got to"
"This iconic hotel sets the standard for luxury amongst Singaporean hotels. It‚Äôs where the city‚Äôs young and beautiful head after hours for classy cocktails, fine dining and gambling. Of course, plenty of tourists visit too, for the world-famous observation deck which affords stunning views of the Lion City.  My room at Marina Bay Sands was huge and modern, with incredible views of the bay and the Shoppes. The bed was huge and the bathroom had a huge standalone tub that I just couldn‚Äôt wait to get in after a day of exploring the hot and humid city!   The property‚Äôs pool is really something else; in fact, I believe it‚Äôs the world‚Äôs largest rooftop infinity pool. Not too shabby! Before you check in, you should note that guests are only allowed one hour of pool access per day. I have"
"I‚Äôm not the type to complain ever, but this whole trip, from start to finish, has been a disaster. Apparently I‚Äôm allergic to MBS because it has been a train wreck.  I feel awful for the staff because they are wonderful, but their product is worse than any hotel I‚Äôve ever been in.  1) Initial booking- I spent over an hour waiting for their email that would allow me to book our pool stay and our check in time. I called after 20 min saying I had no email even though I had a booking confirmation number. They told me to wait. Called after an hour, they finally rebooked because there was ‚Äúa problem‚Äù with their booking system. Great.  2) They gave us an upgrade at check in from a grand club to their orchid suite (single step upgrade), probably because they could see I had 4 calls to"
"Marina Bay Sands is a landmark. And somehow, it kind of just stops there.  The exterior is splendid, and upon stepping into the lobby, you are greeted by a sense of modern grandeur. From here on, the hotel experience would start to appear lacklustre as compared to its glamour.   Before I go on, do understand that I have very high expectations of this establishment because of its reputation and, of course, price tag.  Majority of staff are well-trained and polite most of the time, but none of them displayed the intuition or sincerity that is characteristic of exceptional hospitality. My husband and I, two sleep-deprived parents carrying our 5-month old, checked in at the counter. It was all smooth-sailing, and at the end of it all, the counter staff asked if we needed anything"
"1st time doing a staycay here. Very impressed by the staff of MBS. This is the only hotel so far ( among the rest of my 5-star hotel staycay) that I‚Äôm very impressed by the awesome customer service manned by the ‚Äúexpress service‚Äù team. Other than being professional in the way they talk to you, they really know exactly what your requests are all done with a smile in their tone and this is done consistently among the different employees I spoke to.  Other hotels in-house operator team just does not execute this type of service with the same level of professionalism.   The housekeeping team too is very professional and very friendly. I just requested for a top-up of certain toiletries without room make up but the lady servicing my room took her own initiative to also do a quick"
"First experience staying with Marina Bay Sands Hotel.Booked this hotel with the assistance from the gorgeous lady,Ms Veron. Stayed in room 4578.Very enriching stay and amazing 5 star service. Check in was assisted Lavisha. Well groom and explained the hotel facilities clearly. Deserved a special commendation to her. Room was specially upgrade by Mr Ramesh who gave us the premier room with an astonishing bay view. Spacious and clean room that was prepared by Jerry. Infinity pool was just amazing to swim in especially with my 2 year old daughter.This special staycation was a memorable one. Thank you to MBS teams for this unforgettable stay."
I and my wife stayed in MBS Singapore for 1 night during her 33rd birthday. The room was great with a perfect city view. The bathroom was spacious and wonderful. We received a surprise birthday cake from MBS and the cake was very delicious. I would also like to thank Mr. Ramesh who attended us and offered us his professional service. He was very helpful and paid attention to details. Overall it was a wonderful stay at MBS and I definitely will come again for any special occasions in future. Thank you Mr. Ramesh. Thank you MBS for giving us a pleasant and wonderful time.
"Booked harbour view room and it was the best decision ever. Gorgeous view and a big room with complimentary snacks and drinks. Check in was really fast after we registered for a check in slot the day before.  Requested for a cake as it‚Äôs my mom‚Äôs birthday and they left it in our room as we were out for lunch with matches included so we could lit the candle.  Infinity pool slot is also booked easily and the crowd were spaced out well between 3 pools, but 1 hour is really too short but can‚Äôt be helped. Sky park entry is also included. Breakfast was not included but we had it at Rise.   Really had a great experience and this surprise staycation for my mom was a success. Short but sweet and hopefully next time."
I had a memorable stay at MBS from 17 - 19 Mar. Mr Ramesh who is the Front Office Manager assisted very kindly with all my requests. I wanted to check if the room will be ready by the time I checked-in as I had 2 young kids with me and he assured me that he will have the room ready for us. I requested for a cake as we were celebrating my husband's birthday and he arranged for the birthday amenities to be sent to the room as a surprise. We truly enjoyed ourselves throughout the stay. Service was excellent and stay was enjoyable and memorable.
My 1st time visit for staycation at MBS is horrible! I have stayed in RWS and Amara santuary during Covid period and the check in experience is very smooth and fast. MBS charges so high but their check in procedure sucks. Like cheapo hotel! This is going to be 1st and last staycation in MBS!  I demand a partial refund in my stay price.
"We didnt wanted to write any bad review but after 3 consective days, its either there is a safety issue or we are not fated to stay here.  Please see photos below.  Day 1 - long pin pierced into daughter's toe at pool area. Hotel promise to clean the whole pool area.  Day 2 - saw a rusty nail at the same area, just staring right at us when we reach the pool. Same spot.  Again, hotel promise to ensure safety at pool area in the evening and again the next morning.  Day 3 - staircase at same spot chipped off. May not be easily indentifiable but still a safety issue.  Mbs infinity pool seem dangerous.  Consective 3 days after we wrote in to the hotel for first 2 incidents. Of coz, we also email hotel on 3rd incident at the same spot."
Free nights to casino members. Mr Daniel at the gorgeous infinity pool  was kind and friendly. The hotel is very well placed among attractions and food was easy to get especially cheap ones using food delivery apps
"Decided to do a staycation here with my family in celebration of their birthdays as well. It‚Äôs been 10 years since MBS were built, finally time to treat ourselves after admiring the building every time we would pass it.   I would like to start by saying everything was BETTER THAN EXPECTED.  My first impression was already great when I was kindly greeted at the check in counter. Handled by Mr Mark & Miss Mary Jane(I might get her name wrong)  at tower 3, both of them were very polite and explain to me everything in detail about the hotel. Where I can get my membership card, my hotel gifts, recommended me where to go and shop for better deals.   That already was a very good start to my stay. Only to make things better, I actually felt almost everyone working in MBS is really well"
"Had a staycation for two nights and it‚Äôs a good stay. Check in was prompt and everything was clearly explained to us as there is a need to book the time slot for the infinity pool and gym due to the Covid period. We had a room facing the garden and view was excellent. There‚Äôs a free mini bar with juice and soft drinks and a Nespresso machine. All the towels are sealed for hygiene and we are assured of the cleanliness in the room. The view from the top/infinity pool is nice and even if you don‚Äôt swim, it‚Äôs recommended to go up and see the scenery. There‚Äôs also jacuzzi there. Hotel is conveniently located and near places of attractions."
"MBS will always be my favourite destinstion for staycay, shopping, leisure and entertainment. It's not called an Integrated Resort for nothing cos everything that is good in life (that you can afford) is within arm's reach at MBS.  Spend some time away from the heat, in the beautifully arranged Casino. Do the evening at the infinity pool. Dine at one of the signature restaurants. Have supper and drinks at the bar. Breakfast in bed. And repeat...   Best of all, the superb service from all the staff."
"I would like to compliment the staff, Lina from infinity pool. She was very cheerful and her service was excellent. My family and I enjoyed our stay in mbs and the food was great too üëçüèº Our room was clean and the view is the highlight of our stay!!"
On our last day of staycation 25th of feb the hotel manager and his security staff attended to my friend while she was suffering from what is most likely food poisioning. I requested a wheelchair at around 7am and was expecting only 1 person to show up and to my surprise 4 staff came and one of them was the hotel manager. The staffs carried my friend to the wheelchair and the hotel manager offered to carry my belongings as I carried quite a number of stuffs. Once we reached ground floor the staffs supported my friend to the lobby to flag for a cab while i was doing the checking out process. The staffs were all very friendly and it made me want to come back to stay here again.
"I would like to sincerely thank Ms Vithya for assisting with the smooth check in process and going the extra mile to make our stay special.  We have booked 3 rooms with a family of 8. Ms Vithya was kind, polite and went the extra mile to assist us with the very efficient check in (getting another one of her colleagues to help with the check in process), allowing early check in so that our 2 year old infant could have her nap. She even assisted with getting our rooms all on the same level so that our stay was much more convenient."
"I have book a stay at MBS for 2 nights, it was at night when I flip the bed blanket and found out there is stain  on the bed cover, not bed sheet. It was a unpleasant stay, instead of 2 night, I check out without staying the 2nd night. Just a reminder to all guest who are staying in hotel, please check the cleanliness and hygiene especially in this covid period once you enter the room."
"It was a huge Orchid Suite overlooking the Gardens by the Bay! The view was absolutely amazing! Overall, service was good and unobtrusive. Check-in was easy and they provide you with wet cloths and cold water bottles while you are waiting in line.The place had everything you could think of and even more. A big living room filled with Nespresso coffee, tea, newspapers, a huge TV.  MBS was a great experience! I wish we could have stayed for more days. A big thank you to the MBS staff. I would recommend staying at the Marina Bay Sands, even if it's only for a night"
"I and my friend booked this lovely hotel to celebrate her birthday. It was an amazing experience. Staff hospitality is on the highest level! Our room was upgraded upon arrival and we stayed in a room with a beautiful bay view. Upon arrival AC was not turning on, we called the reception and it did not take 2 minutes for the technical maintenance representative to appear and fix it. I recommend this hotel to everyone!"
"My family stayed for 2 nights at the MBS during Chinese New Year and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Although it's a large hotel, check in was a breeze even with the additional measures in place due to Covid-19. We did not have to wait and checked in smoothly at the appointed time. This was a huge contrast to our experience a few months back at RWS.   The staff were consistently very good. Clearly well trained, takes pride in their work and care for the customers.  We booked two rooms - a Premier room and a deluxe room for our family, not knowing that the the different room type meant we will need to stay in different towers. Yuri who checked us in was very gracious in upgrading our deluxe room to a premier one so that our family can stay at the same tower and on the same floor."
"It was a very good experience to stay at Marina Bay Sands! Perfect room, perfect amenities, friendly staffs and good security measure during this Covid pandemic!   The hotel staffs are very helper especially in helping us with our luggage upon checkin and checkout.   Will definetely come back for another staycation in the future."
Served my SHN at this hotel. Have to say. Love this place. The balcony can be opened for fresh air. The food was surprisingly to my liking although sometimes it's not that good (chefs may have bad days too)  But the happy part of this is the front desk staffs who deserves a pat on the back for doing a good job.
"From the booking office to the room upgrade to the infinity pool to the hospitality extended by the hotel staff to the delicious food to the complimentary parking to the $120 mall voucher to the gift shop, this is a staycation not to be missed. Thank you MBS!"
"Bf booked a premier king room w harbor view as a bday surprise. During check in, Ms Iryn (if I remember correctly) was very helpful and cheerful. As it is our first time and we do not have any preference in terms on which tower, Ms Iryn told us that she selected tower 2 for us as the harbor view is nicer there. Her instructions to the various attractions were also clear and precise.  Went to the sky park, infinity pool, artscience museum and gym as part of the hotel perks. Awesome stay!"
"Thank you for your unconditional hospitality that we experienced during our staycation. Definitely we will come back again in coming Chinese New year.  Thank you for your delicious food such as breakfast, lunch and diner during our stay."
"My family and I had a 3D2N staycation at MBS during Christmas that week, and we dine in at Blossom restaurant near tower 2. While waiting for our reservation to call, my grandmother suddenly felt dizzy and was about to fall (as she hadn‚Äôt eaten anything yet and my mum was not around). Luckily there‚Äôs a lady walk past who saw this and quickly came over to hold on to her, as I‚Äôm was unable to lift her. Both of us hold on to her, and I quickly called my mum to come over to help us.   I sincerely wish to thank that lady who came and help us. Saw her name tag as Chris. She should be one of the staff from the Giftshop (tower 2), as I saw her walked into that store after that. Once again, I would like to thank her for help and being alert at that situation.  Thank you, Chris"
"Me and my friends had a get together lunch at Rise Restaurant today and the food as always is superb. But what it makes it extra special was the service of Ferrari to us. Her natural warmth and accomodating gestures makes us want to come back for more. As some of us decided to fill up for a membership, the lady by the name Yico was very helpful and patient not only to us but to everyone in the queue doing some enquiries. I cant help but give credit to these service oriented ladies. May their tribe continue to grow."
Its worth the value. Everything is superb. We stay at premier tower 1 room 4477 (the centre of the best landscape to take picture) The room is huge with complementary beverages and snack and coffee maker. They replenish daily. Got sofa bed. Bathtub is nice.my boy loves it. The infinity pool is the best ever. During pandemic limited 1x per room to swim at infinity pool and need to book. Parking is $8/day can purchased at counter.
We only spent one night here for my birthday staycation and I must say that everything was excellent. Every process was arranged very well and smooth from the pre-arrival until the day of check-in. The front desk Mustika & Glady are very friendly and hospitable. Great breakfast with excellent service by Chloe from Rise restaurant. The 20 layer cake is really good from Lavo and thanks for the service by Deborah. They made our hotel stay a great one with their welcoming spirit! Well done and thank you for a great staycation! Definitely will stay in this hotel again :)
"I stayed for just a night for my solemnization celebration at RISE restaurant.  Although i had only booked a normal room, upon check in (which was really fast!) i was upgraded to a higher category with a complimentary late check out. It was a great surprise which i didn't expect.  But the true surprise was in seeing the room. given the 44th floor, the room was vast and had huge panoramic window views of the Marina. Truly breathtaking! I am so devasted that in our stress to complete things prior to our solemnization, we didnt have time to take photos or to really appreciate the stunning views.  We left the room for a couple of hours to attend to some errands and upon our return, we were met with another surprise, this time with a petite chocolate cake for our ""wedding"". It was"
"One night staycation with family (two kids) during post Covid period . Taking up the $399 staycation package (S$50 dining or spending credits) which I think is reasonable ( or else would be overprice for local staycation as local can just visit the shopping abd restaurants there anyway) .   What I like:  Spacious room with great view ( must choose higher floor ) I tried my luck requested  for free upgrade room. Lucky enough I got it . maybe this is due to Covid Low peak seasons during weekday.  Nevertheless, please try to top up to get the higher floor with Marina Bay view as you definitely don‚Äôt want to missed this floor to ceiling abd wall to wall full height maximised view from the room. It was awesome !   Great pool . Covid period only limited to one hour but limited hour"
"‚ÄúAshley‚Äù she is welcoming Korean speaking staff work at Check-in counter.  You should find her at the counter if you consider that you deserve to have exceptional hospitality & personalised service from Marina Bay Sands. She absolutely looked after me and my friend who visited the hotel for the first time and guided the hotel facilities with detail oriented attitude. She must have the notable number of complimentary feedbacks so I regret that I can write only one!   + don‚Äôt go to infinity pool at night.

"Marina Bay Sands stands triple in its own category of ultra-elite and in the top 10 most expensive Hotels ever constructed in the World. Along with the Burj Al Arab, Burj Khalifa, Wynn Palace Macao and Abraj Al-Bait they‚Äôve marked the World with their unique structures coupled with incredible feats of Architectural and Engineering achievements. Our luxury experience commenced as soon as we stepped foot off our plane, our MBS representative met us at the gate, whisked us through the Airport, customs & security, assisted with luggage and escorted us to our waiting MBS Mercedes transportation where our driver greeted us with cold wash clothes, water and champagne to set us in the mood for what was about to come. We appreciated this exceptional reception after an 15hr flight,"
Was the most amazing hotel. Worth the extra money for a higher level room overlooking the city giving the best views of the nightly light show. The pool has the most stunning views of Singapore and the views from the towers stunning. Food is fabulous and so are the cocktails - totally excellent.
"This is one of the iconic hotels of Singapore for good reason. The sweeping views over Singapore, the infinity pool and the hot spa bath were definite highlights. The rooms were spacious and clean, and there are so many attractions to explore nearby. The staff were attentive, friendly and professional.   The only con to be aware of is the check in process took a long time given the large numbers of other people also queuing up at check in time.  Overall this was a very enjoyable staycation experience!"
"Choosen MBS for friend staycation as there were many good reviews. However to my horror, service and rules were so so bad. Front desk Nicolette and manager kenny are super unprofessional and unhelpful. Booked 2 rooms for 4 person. Was denied connecting room as we were friends. Worse is denied having rooms at the same floor. So whats the point of having a stayca when rooms were so far away. Explanation given were MBS rules for COVID Prevention. Do not understnad why total of 5 people allowed in 1 room but having room at the same floor not allowed. Worse is Manager Kenny did not gave a professional explanation but blamed it in the MBS regulation. MBS really need to review their rules in allocating room. Such a fruatrating and diaappointed staycation."
"This was the second time we stayed at MBS to celebrate our 3rd wedding anniversary. Though the queue at the check-in took longer than expected, we were very pleased with their service. Our room was upgraded and we had an awesome view of the city area. Last year, our room was also upgraded and we had the garden view. Our room was on the 50th floor and it was so spacious! The bed was comfy and the bathroom had very nice amenities! Service was prompt and the staff were polite and attentive. We had breakfast at Spago and the food and service did not disappoint. Our toddler had an amazing time at the infinity pool. We had a very relaxing and enjoyable time. This is one hotel that we will truly look forward to visiting over and over again.üòä"
"After it opened 10 years ago, the room we stayed in - Premier King Garden /Harbour View - is showing its age. But what made our staycation a memorable one were the excellent staff service, the check-in arrangement and communications, and a pleasant surprise.   I requested for early check-in at 2pm, and this went smoothly due to the queue arrangement and SMS communication, notifying me in the morning on what time to arrive at the hotel. The female staff who checked us patiently answered a list of my questions and helped to upgrade our room when she found out that we were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary.   The room‚Äôs Express Service helped to arranged for a security staff to my room in less than 10mins after my call to solve an issue with the room safe. Similarly, when"
"It was difficult to find a slot for the infinity pool, but thanks to the excellent staff we got it! Only 1 hour/day, due to the safe distancing measures, but I‚Äôve never experienced the water so clean and enjoyed the pool so quietly. Special thanks to Darrence who welcomed my family and I during the check in by helping us to plan our 4d3n stay in 10 minutes! We brought bicycles and we could keep them safely in the storage room right outside of tower 3. You can always count on the MBS staff on site!  Luckily I asked the staff a couple of days before the stay: the information got via email was that it was not possible... Thank you MBS staff for a very pleasant stay. Keep it up!!!"
"Staycation of 3 family members in room at non peak weekday.   I might have too much expectations for this hotel thus i felt disappointed.   Cons:  The moment you enter the lobby, no directions were given where to check in or join the queue. During check-in, receptionist was not welcoming and needs to improve on tonality.   Front desk was leaking water and dripped on me, didn‚Äôt apologise or offer me tissue and just replied ‚Äúyea we‚Äôre working on this‚Äù   Did not explain anything about hotel facilities only point to me the lift lobby.   Every morning we walk down the corridor or lobby , no staff will greet us. It doesn‚Äôt feel like a luxury hotel at all.   Pros:  Room was nice, spacious, clean, nothing to complain about.   Swimming pools staffs were the best , nice and friendly and"
"We booked for our anniversary. True, the room prices are high; but we got what we paid for: Club Room on 41st floor, with a city view. No regrets staying 2 nights there. City views at night were stunning, day time views were enjoyable too.  Club room included high-tea from 2-4pm and evening cocktail from 5-7pm. Food there was fantastic! Views were fantastic too. There were 3 restaurants to choose from for breakfast, we tried the exclusive clubroom and Spago. Quality of food at the clubroom was slightly better than at Spago. But still great nonetheless, they only served TWG tea. Coffee at the club was also better.  We managed to book an hour for the pool only. Views didn disappoint. Swimming at night with a great view was such a lovely experience!  Staff service was good,"
"Was my first staycation at MBS and decided to give it a try as traveling overseas is not an option at the moment. Decided to go for MBS because of the promotion they had and the free parking. Booked a 2D1N stay in premium room for 3 pax and it was a great overall experience. MBS has staggered check-in process by making advanced sms bookings, unfortunately I missed this information in the email they have sent and only know when I reached the check-in counter. But the check-in process was rather smooth once it reaches my turn. Got a room at the 30th floor, great view, great room. I managed to book a 1-hr pool session and it was a nice experience but rather short, sadly. There were activities to keep me occupied for the 2 days: touring of Art Science Museum, dining at Koma,"
Just checked in for a 4 night stay and tried to book a slot for the pool. Found out that it was apparently full for all days. That‚Äôs crazy esp given the pool is one of the key attractions! Hotel guests should be prompted ahead of time there‚Äôs this risk so they might consider other venues instead or ask for pre-booking of pool!
"Went for a 1 night staycation at MBS last 22-23 Dec 2020. Every day, each guest can only book 1 hour of pool use. Huge, huge thank you to Mr. Dennis for making this possible for us. Special shoutout to Wawa, the staff attendant, and Nas, the life guard also for their help.   This was not our first time at MBS, but I'd say that this visit has became more memorable and amazing because of the service of these pool staff especially Mr. Dennis. Marina Bay Sands is truly lucky to have such a remarkable staff.   Even though we are visiting during this pandemic, we still felt safe as they explained to us how the hotel makes sure the cleanliness and sanitation for the safety of all guests are a priority. We are particular when it comes to service whether in restaurants, or hotels BUT"
"I had the opportunity to experience the luxurious Marina Bay Sands Hotel Sands Suite - It‚Äôs been a pipe dream of mine to one day splurge and stay in the expensive hotel room worth thousands of dollars per night Immediately after entering the 136-square meter suite on the 48th floor, I am in total awe‚Ä¶ The living area of the suite was huge at least 2 times the size of a typical hotel room and even came with a pool table! Floor-to-ceiling windows provided an excellent panoramic vantage point over Marina Bay and the Singapore skyline The Bedroom was massive with a king bed and walk-in closet. There was the bathroom which came with bathtub, rain shower and double sinks It is reassuring to see the SG Clean-certified integrated resort take cleaning and safe distancing very seriously."
"Recently had my staycation at MBS and it was a rather pleasant experience. However, the waiting time for check in was rather frustrating. I probably spent half of my day waiting.  However, the rest of my stay was rather pleasant. Especially the staffs at the infinity pool, they were really helpful and friendly. Rooms were on the high floor and had a birds eye view of gardens by the bay."
"Went twice within a span of two weeks, and was impressed by the service both times. Dad had to make use of the wheelchair and the wonderful roving staff stationed near the Tower 3 check in counter went out of his way to help us get to the top floor for our viewing experience, even though he had to make numerous trips up and down and around to make that happen. We were thus able to get in just before everyone else did. I didn‚Äôt get his name but thank you to the staff on duty that day (16 Nov)."
"Super crowded at lobby, just feel like at first world hotel in Genting. Room is old and full of dust. Cleaning standard really need to improve, see photo then you‚Äôll know what I mean. 5 star hotel but the most only 3 star for me. Don‚Äôt waste your money."
"Had an enjoyable stay at MBS and we even got a chance to enjoy the pool which was really beautiful üëçüèª all thanks to Brandon from Poolside with his excellent service, going out of his way to assist us in getting a pool booking. Thumbs up!"
"I stayed at MBS with 11-14 December with my family and it was a very comfortable stay with excellent service. It was disappointing that we did not manage to book a pool slot when we arrived, but one of the restaurant staff at Spago, Dave, secured us two pool slots when we merely mentioned we didn‚Äôt get one, without even being asked! I was very touched and impressed with his act of service. It was a lovely family staycation- will return!"
Booked 3 rooms for a family staycation but sadly it was a forgettable experience.   1. Checking in took close to an hour for just one room. Subsequently was told that the other room keys will be left in the room that was ready. When my family members reached and was registering the two front office agents mentioned that there is no such thing as leaving the room keys in the room. Wrong info throughout   2. Tried to book slots for the infinity pool but system was full of bugs and eventually could not secure any slots. Was told by the front office agent that when I was trying to book on Oct 15 the system just went live and it was the first implementation thus there were a lot of bugs. Only managed to get a 9.30am slot in the end.   3. Staffs were poorly trained. Wanted to visit
"We booked a Bay Suite for family of 5 with a seamless booking process from the hotline. Was worried about checking in but the process was fast with not many in the Sands Lounge. Recommend to pay a little more for Club Lounge benefits as the general queues were so long! Room quality was excellent with a view over Gardens by the Bay. Tips: have your breakfast only at Spago‚Äôs as the food & coffee quality is superior to the other restaurant options. Our butler service was great - we had fruits, cookies , milk , cakes delivered daily ! Book your pool slot in advance and you won‚Äôt be disappointed with the amazing experience swimming in the sky with our beautiful city skyline as a backdrop. Five stars for the high service quality among every staff and the room quality. Hope that the"
"World Class Service! Highly recommended for anyone who believes top service is imperative to an enjoyable stay. Some parts of the hotel may not be spanking new (eg balcony tiles), but we were beyond satisfied by the excellence in customer service during our stay - certainly reason enough to want to come back again! Whenever we called with any concern (bathroom, pool slot and belongings left behind), this was not only addressed professionally, but empathetically and most swiftly.   I must say, for a massive hotel, Marina Bay Sands Singapore really has surprised us with the impeccable standard of guest relations. They clearly have guest satisfaction at top priority and therefore understood inside out, leaving even the most discerning guest impressed and assured to have an"
"Our family of 2 adults and 2 kids had a thoroughly enjoyable staycation at Marina Bays Sands. Our room on Level 29 had a good city view. Looking out from our window,Apple stand was on the left and the Artmuseum was on the right. The whole complex was very crowded. Who says we are living in covid 19 restrictions?Car parking was a bit of a hazzle. So was the q for hotel check in.The restaurants were busy most meal times. Access to the infinity pool was difficult as guests were limited to one hour session per day.The Skypark observation deck on Level 57 is a must go at MBS. All in all,too much to do and to enjoy in the 2night 3 day stay."
"If you are looking for an unforgettable staycation experience please go for MBS.   I have celebrated my birthday in a city view high floor premier room. The moment I walked into the room I was amazed - the huge window captured beautiful skyline of Marina Bay. It‚Äôs so therapeutic regardless of the weather (it rained a couple of time).  The infinity pool was really a sight to behold. It‚Äôs really cold but so much fun. I actually like their crowd control measure whereby check in and facility booking are queued via SMS.  Room making was excellent. On the second day I placed a couple of champagne glasses and the service crew, Jian Yang placed the same number of coaster and espresso cubes for my guest as well. It‚Äôs a really nice touch which made my day!  I think it worth every single"
"I had a great staycation to celebrate my anniversary. Alice was polite, efficient and very helpful upon check in. Even though it was busy with guests, MBS has a good system to ensure safe social distancing and they are strict with the number of people going to the rooms. Room was clean with a great view of the sea. Overall, I had a great time there!"
"Booked a room to celebrate my friend's birthday. I wrote in early to request for their help in planning for a surprise party and was amazed by their promptness in replying and in doing their best to accommodate to all my requests. I was impressed that the concierge staff even knows who I was and what I needed when I simply told him my name. He explained that all concierge staff had been briefed and they were supposed to remember such details.   Needless to say, the room was pristine clean, the best I have stayed in Singapore, and the view from the room was just breathtaking."
"Staycation was great with beautiful harbour view. Room was clean, Staffs were friendly. Good promo given with 60 credits per room/night which it can use for dining. Sad that didn't manage to access the infinity pool as it was fully book! Will definitely come back for staycation again."
"It's been a few years since i last stayed at the MBS Hotel, but it remains fun and enjoyable.  The Infinity Pool wasn't available throughout our 2 nights' stay, but there were many other things to do and eat within the compound and outside it.  We stayed at Tower 3 this time, and there was a balcony where you could sit and eat, read or just chill and appreciate the view of the sea and Gardens by the Bay.  The bed and linen were extremely comfortable, and their service was very prompt and pleasant.  There are also many restaurants and shops to wander through. Great staycation."
"I would to extend my compliment to Ms Catherine,the pool attendance of MBS. She has went thru the extra mile and has made my holiday stay a memorable one. Her patient & caring attitude is worth commendable."
"I would like to compliment a staff named Hannah from the front office. She is very kind and helpful and shows great initiative in her job, keep it up! Enjoyed our stay there. We stayed there on 1st December 2020."
"I book Premier twin city view room at this hotel for 3 adults +1 children (6 months old) for our family Christmas staycation. Such excitement was crush within a day when the hotel confirmation give a call that this room could not be occupied by 3 adults + 1 Child as we requested. I could only accommodate either 3 adults or 2 adults+2 children. Through so much debate I know I would not win it since it's hotel policy which is ridiculous, how much space does 6 months old child need?! The hotel management need to review their room policy again!"
"I wasn't very happy about the time it took for checking in (even after I had provided all information via online check-in), but everything thereafter was very good. Room was perfect with natural light and fantastic view.   Well maintained room accessories, high quality bathroom fittings and well-cleaned windows hinted that the hotel pays attention to details. Clean towels wrapped for higher safety during the pandemic.   Perfectly working air-conditioning control and WiFi was better than expected. Room service was excellent both in terms of food quality and classy delivery.   Infinity pool experience was excellent, almost magical as advertised.  We hit two snags during our stay, a problem with the hot water and TV. We tried the 'priority service' button on the phone a few times"
"Was staying in mbs after phase 2 implemented. visited skypark swimming pool at night and in morning to take sunset and sunrise photo. Pool was by appointment but worth the effort as it was no longer crowded. Room comes with balcony, with nice view of garden by the bay, though the balcony needs some cleaning, could be due to covid19.  Restaurants just below my room and mrt within walking distance."
"I always enjoyed my stay with MBS. While I would like to compliment a staff name Iryn from Front office. She is very kind and helpful and show her initiative towards her job. Appreciated her effort and keep it up, will return once again."
"Firstly, it may be a one time thing. We got the room with noisy fridge(i thought was aircon) which makes me (a light sleeper person) not able to sleep on the first night. After i gave them a feedback, they straightly change the fridge to the new one without noise. I was almost gave up my second night to just go back home as there is no point to do staycation without good sleep. Thankfully after they changed the fridge, everything was OK.  They have strict number of guest come and go into the tower. They count it in front of the lift entrance. So bear in mind to give ample time as it can be quite a queue on busy hours. As far my staycation journey goes, this is the only hotel that does it.  The pool is limited to 1 hour and very hard to get slot. Make sure to book early."
"I had a few nights of wonderful stay at the Marina Bay Sands Singapore Hotel with lots of shopping and feasting. Come on down to this beautiful city for a break from work with festivities all year round! The hotel staff with their professionalism, friendliness, and superior customer service skills will pamper you and make your stay an enjoyable one!"
"We truly had a wonderful time at MBS! The room we stayed at is a premiere room.  The view from our room was the Gardens by the Bay, and it was just so relaxing! It was very spacious, even the bathroom with a very nice bath tub.  The room was very clean.  The towels and robes were even hygienically  packed and sealed. Special thanks to one of the housekeeping staff Xi Mei.  I appreciate her initiative of placing  a kiddie slipper and a small towel for my child  when we returned to our room without us requesting for it.  My daughter was happy she has her own kiddie slipper as we had ours. They also have some complimentary drinks (2 soda cans and 2 bottles of juice in the mini fridge, bottled water and snacks. Also, we have complimentary tickets to the observatory.  The only sad"
"Booked a premier city view room with a bathtub to create more play space for our young kids. Didn't regret the decision as they had a lot of fun running around the room and enjoyed themselves with water play in the bathtub. They were also charmed by the city view every morning when they woke up and the night skyline during bedtime. Besides these, we also had complimentary tickets to head up to the observatory and it was a magnificent view up there! Foodwise, there were a lot of options and the kids were able to eat for free at the buffet restaurants in MBS as they were under 5. We were surprised that we had to book a timeslot at the infinity pool so it's good to book the slots the moment you receive a confirmation email from the hotel. Special thanks to the staff who went the"
The last time i went to mbs was in 2019 December I went with my friends and family. i am a member of the hotel and I get special rooms for a good price. food was nice staff was amazing and the rooms were clean and nice
"Staycation?!?! Never in our holidays plans. But when air, land and sea is not an option for the year. Staycation might be best option.  Booked a premium room with city view. The room size was huge,so was the bathroom with separate standing shower room and bathtub.  Family with younger kids or babies will love it because you have ample size to park your gigantic stroller and large space to open your luggages.  However, they do not have brushing kit or brushing mug for kids if you forgot to bring one. Bathrobes and slippers provided a upon request. (shouldn't that be included in the room since they know there are kids checking in?) Not to mentioned about having a stool for your kids to wash their hands or brush their teeth.  A big bathroom does not necessary provide you with more"
Had a staycation with family ! The rooms were comfortable. Enjoyed the infinity pool though we had to book tine slots in advance and they tend to get sold out pretty soon. Was happy to receive observatory tickets as a part of the staycation deal and the kids enjoyed the view ! Overall a nice experience
"I stayed at MBS Tower 3 room 4416 with my family. Due to the Covid, the check in process was abit longer. Overall we are very happy with the services at MBS, the room was clean and facing the garden view. I would to say a big thank you to the housekeeper at level 44 Miss Wang Li for her sincere smile and service. We will definetely come back for another staycation."
"MBS has the best accommodation, amenities and the best service staff at the hotel, including of check-in staff/room service and other necessities.  The room is very spacious and children like and can play in the room without worrying of getting hurt.  I enjoyed the good scenery from the balcony.  The only thing a Chinese do not like is there is a big mirror facing the bed that we are sleeping and it is not a good sign."
"Had a night at MBS. Price wise is definitely high even though it was reduced due to no travellers during COVID era.   However, service and quality of the hotel speaks for the price itself. Everything was top notch. From front desk to the security team to its room service. Will definitely return if i have extra money. The view at the infinity pool is definitely one you have to visit once in your lifetime. Even though MBS is 10 years old, amazingly it was well maintained.   All in all, such an amazing staycaytion. Trust me, one night isnt enough! Kudos to the staff for making my stay a memorable one."
"Marina Bay Sands is one of those places you must visit if you come to Singapore, like a checkbox in a to-do list. The rooms are clean and quite comfortable in 2010 style. TVs are from another age though. First of all, if you come by car, be aware that there is no direct access from the car park to the hotel. You will have to walk through the entire adjoining mall with your luggage. And the mall is huge. You can tell that your stay does not start off in the best possible way. The hotel also is awsomely big, Somehow, we have a bit of the impression of being in Las Vegas or even at the airport, especially at the time of check-in. Because of COVID-19, you can only use the pool for one hour a day, provided you have managed to reserve a time slot, which is not always possible.  We"
We first visited mbs at the time when it's open we remember how excited we were from the new consort.  Ten years after it's still home for some of the best places to dine in sg.  Duo to the covid the pool is bit annoying.  But beside that there is other fun activities  . Great for 1-2 nights
Some say this is the best hotel in the world! .......and it may very well be.   Now internationally famous world wide from the Crazy Rich Asians movie this hotel lives up to every bit of the hype that it has. Very impressive and state of the art with some of the most one of a kind features and views of Singapore.   Definitely hands down the best pool in the world on top of the hotel and only for hotel guests. Food here is the best! But if you want to save some money you can also walk down through the lobby onto the many options at the local malls and food courts which are too some of the best in the world as well!
I stayed at this iconic hotel in June 2019 with my husband and 3.5 years old daughter. The experience right from check-in to check-out has been just amazing. Needless  to say that the mall attached to the hotel is huge and has almost all luxury brands. the iconic infinity pool is just superb and one cannot explain in words the experience that it gives. The staff here was super helpful and did everything that we requested for in a very minimum time. Overall this place gave us a superb experience off Singapore.
"Never really thought I'd do a staycation, but with Covid putting paid to all travel plans for the last so many months a weekend away at a hotel barely a few kilometres from home suddenly seemed to be not that bad of an idea.  The good -   The hotel does a really great job of prioritizing health and safety and it felt very safe.  The infinity pool - was not my first time, so the charm had admittedly worn off but was an instant hit with the rest of the folks in my group.  Hard to find fault with what's truly an eclectic experience  The views and the glitz - Enjoyed both the city and garden views, both were good in their own ways.  The city room views don't have a balcony though.  We got upgraded to the Orchid suite for the second night and it was only after that we could"
"Staycation with auntie for 3 days 2 nights. Very happy with comfortable and clean room, nice garden view.   The room attendant - DAN DAN very friendly and polite. Room cleaned by her also very neat and clean."
"Our stay was outstanding the hotel is nice and the service is awesome, front desk and staffs are friendly and amicable. We stayed in room 3475, premier city view. Room was okay, the view is great. If you‚Äôre a smoker, head down to lavo smoking area on level 57. The view there is greaaaaaat!  Love love the infinity pool and the staff there are extremely friendly too, i couldnt get their names, it was the filipino lady and the malay old man serving us the drinks and food. Best of all was  the photographer, rajan. I guess that was his name. üòÖ Thank you Rajan for the wonderful job. We had so much fun!  The only cons staying here is in room dining is a little ex but the food isnt that bad. Best to use the grab app for food or for affordable lunch/dinner you can head down to rasapura"
"Big thanks to Steven Wong for making this room possible. He even took it on to waive additional charges on my behalf.  The generous room that was alloted to me has a room that is bigger than other regular sized hotels. THIS IS SIX STARS!  The view of Marina Bay was incredible at day and night.   The in-room dining menu was superb. My guests and I enjoyed the burger and pizzas, we order them again.  The friendly chambermaid was so helpful to ensure all room ameneties were replenished as soon as I rang for her assistance.  But most of all, Steven Wong who was in comms with me from the get go booking and throughout the duration of my stay.   Lest we forget, all the staff who put in so much effort to make MBS tick daily.  THANKS FOR A MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE"
