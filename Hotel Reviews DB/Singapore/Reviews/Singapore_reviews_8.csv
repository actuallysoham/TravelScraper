"Had a great time with my family and they do have a great team serving from the Heart. Special thanks to Nadia, Rekah, Kimmy from Front office, Ganesan from Concierge, Mun Fung from Peach Blossoms, Benjamin from Peppermint and Michael from Atrium Lounge for making our stay a memorable one."
We enjoyed our first night stay that we've decided to extend another night. The bay view area is nice especially at night. The room and toilet is very clean and comfortable and the staff who assisted us (Prem and Doris) were exceptionally great. The best thing about a hotel stay is not just the room experience but also the guest service experience. We felt welcomed from the very beginning and would recommend others to stay here. Can't wait for travel to be back again so more tourists can enjoy this stay too!
"Rooms are spacious, well furnished and with an awesome view!  The service is excellent both at the reception and restaurants. Special shout out to Justin, who assisted us with our room and recommended great dining options. It definitely made our stay a relaxing and sumptuous experience! :)"
The very green design of the hotel makes a very refreshing escape within the city.  We tried 3 of restaurants in the hotel and really enjoyed the food. Justin was very helpful and ensured we had a pleasant time during our stay.  From booking to check out was hassle free.
"Room was spacious and newly renovated.  TV is LG 55’ IPTV and you could use Chromecast. It would be great if they included a small guide on how to connect. There is a nespresso machine for coffeeholics like myself. The shower and bathtub are separate and it is great. Water pressure and rain shower are OK. Bathtub cleanliness could be improved further. There are 2 toilet bowls I’m not really sure why.  I stayed at the signature Marina Bay room and enjoyed the view of blue sky and MBS. There is also a room balcony that you can go out to take pictures. Do note if you didn’t lock the balcony, aircon will turn off. Aircon can be controlled from 20-25 degrees celcius. Top floors and rooftop swimming pool seem to be still under renovation. Gym has a variety of equipment. Inner"
"Indeed a very memorable 3D2N stay. Feels like a mini Gardens By the Bay. Very nice, and beautifully landscaped hotel with lots of greeneries and garden feel. Very proactive and hospitable staff too from the concierge to the reception to the restaurant making us feel very welcomed and at home. Waking up to an array of  breakfast including heavenly nasi lemak and delectable dim sum at Peppermint with super attentive and responsive staff was amazing. Marina Square shopping mall is just next door which makes is so convenient to shop, dine or engage in activities for children too. Will definitely return again! THANK YOU!!"
"Had a splendid staycay. Newly renovated hotel, room space was generous for small family of 3. View from the room was amazing.  Special thanks to Lydia for the smooth check in process and accommodate to my request for the late check out. Warmest thanks to Yani for helping on the early check in and also for the complimentary birthday cake for my husband. Staff at peppermint restaurant, Shyne, was so helpful and friendly. A big THANK YOU to the team!"
"Zero waiting for Check-in.  Rooms are renovated, thus all-new.  General queries, requests and facilitity bookings are answered via AI response.  Breakfast was great with wide selections and does not feel short of an usual buffet breakfast. Special thanks for the duty manager, Prem.  And the F&B team in Peppermint, especially Stewart."
"We opted for the lifestyle room and was glad that the room space was generous for my parents and I. Toilet has a bathtub btw (yay bathbomb)!!!! Breakfast was nice as well. Apart from the room amenities, I would like to thank all the staff (specifically housekeeping team) for being so efficient whenever we requested for additional items. Will definitely recommend this to anyone who’s looking for a place to chill over the weekend 😊"
Greeted by Nadia when we checked in. Much professionalism displayed. Nice view overlooking Marina Bay. Good hospitality. Just a one nite stay and had buffet dinner there. Great food nice ambience. Gym equip with state of the art machine.  It is so enjoyable and great experience for our stay.
"Is a birthday staycation for my hubby and kids but things doesn’t goes well at all.  1. Check in waited for awhile coz priority was given to those people who wanted to check out. After we check in they informed us they are having a soft launch. ( for this I still can accept even though they should email us way before our check in date which we book this at least 3 month ago) 2. After we went in to our room, the room is nice. Kids wanted to soak in the bath tub. The moment I went in the bathroom, i saw hairs in the bath tub but the best part is along the ream of the tub there is tissue wrap with hair laying at the corner of the tub  ( that really gross me up) so I tell myself is okie as long as I don’t use the bathtub it will be fine. Even though the 2nd day I ask for"
"Love the day bed in the newly renovated room, room was really clean. The property was able to accommodate a room next to mine with my girlfriend and her family, I almost forgot about this request until the check in staff reminded me ☺ Service was tip top, greeted with a very positive attitude everywhere we went. Was surprised with a complimentary mini birthday cake for my girlfriend's birthday too! Just a small issue, part of the swimming pool was under renovation however my daughter still enjoyed her swim very much! Thank you to all the staffs at ParkRoyal Collection, keep up the good work!"
"We held our wedding banquet at PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay in Mar 2021. The exceptional service that was delivered by the hotel staff allowed us to enjoy ourselves largely stress-free throughout this entire process. The Garden Ballroom is definitely one of the most modern and beautiful ballroom in Singapore as of now after the major facelift that was completed at the start of 2021. In addition, food was delicious and the portion was huge.   The team that was led by the experienced Banquet Manager, Kelvin, and proficient AV Lead, Tarmizi, ensured that everything was executed smoothly and on point during the banquet.   Last but not least, the impeccable service that was provided by Assistant Catering Sales Manager, Xina, was highly commendable. She ensured that the transition"
We were at the ground floor lobby waiting to check out. Nizar who was on duty approached us. He was very helpful and fast! Thank you for your kind help. Our check out was very smooth as he assisted with our luggage and stroller. Thanks Nizar!
"Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay, a great location that is convenient to the various shopping malls, places of interest and most importantly, awesome service provided by the staff of the establishment.   All staff provided service from their hearts and has been attentive, helpful and accommodates to all our needs. Staff to mentioned are Nadia, Front Office Manager, Nizar, Assistant Chef Concierge, Ravi from Security, Sunny (if its correct from Houskeeping), Alicia, Room Attendant who cleaned our room, Alvin, Assistant Manager and Stewart, Restaurant Manager at Peppermint. Each individual excel in their special ways going the extra mile in providing and rendering their services.   Though staying only for 2 nights, the room is clean, spacious, a great view of the Marina Bay area"
"My family and i stayed at parkroyal collection , was very impressed by the service upon arrival and checking out, a special mention of staff yani she was smiling and greeting us upon arrival. Overall we enjoy our stay thank you parkroyal collection."
"Big difference from the previously Marina Mandarin Hotel. Interior at the reception was amazing. Beautiful... Garden in a Hotel.  Staff were very friendly. Queue was pretty long at check-in but i was glad that there were 6 staff handling the process and beverages were offered to guests in the queue.  Fitness Centre was chic. Love the concept. The machines were among the latest, very user friendly.   Room was chic. Quite modern and pleasing to the eyes. The closet and minibar very nicely hidden. The shower cubicle was a bit too small. It fits 1 person. Bathtub was pretty shallow but was good. There is a water dispenser beside the tap. Great idea but.. you can't fill up your bottle or the one provided in the room because, the dispenser was short. You can use the glasses provided"
"Thank you Parkroyal Collection! Efficient check-in/out. Service was great by the hotel team.  Breakfast spread was good. Those looking for halal options, this hotel is a sure to go. We love the vibes of the hotel interior, filled with plants and birds chirping (the real ones though). We love everything about our lifestyle room. My daughter enjoy her unlimited ice-cream sesh. Oh and pre-booking of the facilities is all done via online. We will be looking forward to have our next staycay here again!"
"My wife and I stayed at ParkRoyal (Marina) from 25-28 Feb.   I was truly impressed by the services of Suresh and Alfiro (not sure if I got your spelling right).   As I was waiting for my cab to arrive, we had a good chat. We talked about exciting places to visit around the area and the chat went on about working experiences in the hotel/ service industry.   Suresh & Alfiro was passionate in their conversations and this makes the experience so engaging! It didn’t seem as if they were in a rush; they took their time and took genuine interest in their conversations with hotel guests. x02 Thumbs up!  As my cab was turning in to the hotel lobby, they ushered us to the cab, opened the doors for both my wife and I. Before we left, they wished us a great day ahead.  Thanks to both for"
Great escapade for the family. Food is great just that the building is a bit dark with the hotel in a park theme. Room is roomy and the bay window is great for kids! My kids love the stay. Thank you for the wonderful at-home feel!
"Upon registration Ms hailey greeted us with a warm and friendly smile. She explained to us regarding the pool, and breakfast covid regulations during our stay. The check in process was quick too! The room is spacious, & well organized. Love the new interior. Thank you to Ms Syahira for arranging the anniversary cake for us. We were suprised, and definitely love the ondehondeh cake!  For breakfast, staffs attended to us were very friendly, and thoughtful. Just that maybe the choices of food is not much due to covid but still its scrumptious.  Upon checking out, it was pleasant and super fast like as Ms Syahira attended to us. Her friendly approach and her smile throughout really make our day. As we were using hero rate , she gave us the goody bag. She also offered us to take a"
"Had a smooth check-in with the Front Office staff, Ms Syahira. A pleasant surprise of Anniversary cake was sent to my room upon check-in, too. Quite impressed with the service provided.  Came for the Afternoon Tea but at a wrong time slot. Staff at Atrium Lounge still took us in despite the wrong time slot. Appreciate much.   Overall, I enjoyed my staycation at Park Royal Collection Marina Bay!"
"We last stayed here in 2014, I remember it looked dated even back then so this revamp is very much needed.  The atrium on the 4th floor is beautiful, certainly evokes a feeling of calmness and tranquility compared to the concrete jungle just outside the doors.   Check in was fast and effortless, we bought our package on KLOOK with our SGRV which came with a room upgrade and 2pm check-out. As we needed 2 rooms, we got 2 adjoining rooms on the 14th floor, with a view of the Fountain of Wealth and the Marina Reservoir off to the side.   Rooms are newly furbished, with laminate flooring and a modern look. Functional and neat. Our rooms also had a little daybed and the balcony is accessible.   The bathroom has a tub, separate standing shower, a bidet seat and an old timey bidet"
Had an amazing stay with my family! One of the best hotels i have ever been to. Beautiful view and love the room! Clean and comfortable. Very spacious too. Received an unexpected welcome gift from the front office staffs which made our day! Will definitely come back again!
"The service at this hotel is really first rate! Right from the start, our wedding coordinator, Xina, was very helpful and sincere with the planning of our wedding. In fact, every member of the hotel staff we've encountered was always so warm and will go the extra mile to help us. This was the case even so for our guests during the wedding!  The food here is really good as well. Many of our guests told us that the menu was very creative and absolutely delicious. Totally not what they expected from a hotel reception.   The hotel was recently renovated as well so the overall aesthetic is very modern and akin to an indoor garden. Having a lunch reception also meant that there were birds chirping throughout the wedding, making it seem like a real life garden!   Overall I would"
"We had a fabulous experience. The DM, Ms Doris guest service was the one who made our stay wonderful and memorable. She personally came up to the room to understand the issue and at once she offered an apology and extend a complimentary breakfast.  The concierge Mr Nawi was so so pleasant. At every time we went out, he will greet my child and made my child smiled and talked in his unique way.  Kudos to the management for having such a great staff."
My wife and I were greatly helped by the staff at ParkRoyal Collection Marina Bay especially Xina! The process was very smooth and everyone enjoyed the food a lot. We received a  lot of complements from our guest regarding the food. The bridal suite was clean and spacious. The Atrium Ballroom was also just the right size for our 100 pax dinner. We would recommend this hotel to others who are keen for a fuss-free garden-themed wedding.
"First time staying at this hotel since it's makeover. Rooms were clean and comfy. We stayed on the 14th floor and had the view of Suntec City. Best part is the toilets had bidets so yeah, major plus points.  The only thing that we missed out is that we did not get the chance to use the pools coz it was already fully booked when we checked in. So yeah, can just imagine the disappointment on my kids' faces.  We did not take breakfast at the hotel coz the hotel is surrounded by malls and there are restaurants nearby too."
"One of the best hotel I have been throughout my entire holidays.Never realise of the gem in my country.  Starting from the conceirge to the front desk was really efficient and polite.The ambience was superb.You will be in awed when you enter the glass door,greeted by massive chandelier,the greenery and the natural colours of the hotel.  The view when from the lift was mesmorising and to top it all,the view from the rooms if you opt for the Marina view, was heart melting right from sunrise to sunset.  You will also be greeted with light show in the evening just from your bed.  Food was fantastic but due to the covid,it will be served rather than you walk.The waiter and waitresses are attentive to your needs and guess what I got a private tour to the eco garden.  The swimming pool"
"My review will be split to 2 parts. Firstly, the stay at the hotel and secondly, the wedding experience.  -Stay at Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay- The hotel is newly renovated at our time of visit. The urban rooms were nice and cosy and we had an unblocked view of MBS. The amenities provided in the room was sufficient and most of the housekeeping/ room service requests can be done via a QR Code by the bedside.   The bridal suite was equally good and equipped with 2 bathrooms, one in the main bedroom (with bathtub) and another in the living room area (no bathtub). Only feedback is that the wardrobe is too small for the amount of attires we had (3x wedding dress + 1 gua). Sunlight was good for make up.   There were bird cages hung along the walkway on level 4 with real birds"
"Organised  a family staycation for the children. The hotel recently opened in Dec 2020 and parts of the hotel was still under renovation. The parking leading up to the carpark was partly closed so the initial track up to the hotel was quite challenging. However, the concierge staff was kind enough to let us park in front of the hotel for the duration of our stay.   The room was very new and recently renovation. But the beds were really single size. so it was quite a squeeze for the 4 of us and then I had asked for an extra bed in the end which proved very helpful for my quality of sleep.   Service staff was also really helpful and prompt answering the call and attending to our needs. Overall, it was quite a positive experience and would recommend the hotel once the renovations"
"The newly renovated atrium was nice with the garden setting. It gave sense of place and welcoming.  However, management and maintenance side I think require more attention for improvement: 1. Upon check-in , we appreciate to let us have early check-in. But when we asked to give us the nicest room upon the room category that we booked, ended up to our dismay , the room given was totally not yet tidied up and seems like just left by previous guest. Isn’t during this Covid period they should alternate the guest’s stay? Also we checked the room view and it is not the Marina bay view that we have booked. So-call Marina bay view is you need to go to the corner or out to balcony then can see Marina bay view. Totally deviate from the photo shown in website for this particular room"
"I went to this hotel for one night staycatio  with my friends. We book 3 rooms. We are very happy to receive welcome drinks and welcome gift from the duty manager Mr. Prem.Beautiful hotel. Interior very beautiful, view of marina bay samds from the hotel is awesome. The rooms are big and comfortable. Balcony and the couch also so good . Frontline staffs are more friendly and approchable with a smiling  face. We also got free upgrade to premium room and 2 hrs late check out. Over all i can say this hotel is a very good  choice for staycation and stay with family and friends.  I felt that lighting should be little more brighter,while taking picture it looks dark. Overall Iam so happy during my stay in parkroyal collection marina bay. And also i strongly suggest this hotel to my"
"Modern and beautiful design and decor around the hotel. The common restaurant area at level 4 is rather welcoming and cosy with the greenery. Room is spacious and has a soothing colour tone.  Breakfast was great too. Particularly like to commend on Laurietta's dedicated service during breakfast. She was rather approachable, attentive and catered to our needs and wants well, providing us with a great experience to round up our staycation."
"Ravi was attentive to our needs and gave us the seats in the garden domes:) he constantly asked us if we needed anything and his team topped up our food regularly, making sure we were fed well. He offered to take photos of us and made sure that we were relaxed and comfortable. Thank you Ravi and team!! We had a pleasant breakfast on 17th March 😊"
where the location of  SINGPOST LETTER BOX though it is not part of his duty  He is very friendly and helpful even though I am not the hotel guest but an old lady and get treated as a guest  THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELPS AND KEEP IT UP. YOU DO SINGAPORE PROUD WITH YOUR GOOD ATTITUDE.. PARKROYAL COLLECTION HOTEL IS LUCKY TO HAVE SUCH AN EMPLOYEE WITH GOOD WORKING ATTITUDE.  As there is no feedback I can give the compliment via tripadvisor  Thank you/Diana
"We had a wonderful stay at Parkroyal and one of the features I needed to highlight was the inbuilt water filter tap in the room. No more plastic bottles or boiling water! The water is fit for drinking and is really useful for making formula milk.  The staffs were also friendly and helpful. A cot and steam sterilizer was prepared on our arrival which helps us a lot. Due to covid, the hotel also opened the ballroom to cater for breakfast guests. Overall I really love the greenery and natural feel of the hotel.  Currently, this place is still on soft launch and because of covid, is sad that they only can put 1 chair in the room. Hopefully, covid will be over soon and it can go back to its normal ways."
"The staff is extremely friendly and welcoming.  I am very impressed that every staff put on a smile and gave warm greetings like ""How was your day?""< ""Have a good day!"" from those at the entrance of the hotel to those who used the elevator. Also the housekeeping staff was patient in understanding my requests despite of them being busy as it was weekend.    I want to  especially thank Kimmy who is friendly and has good customer service, she offered some suggestions on the room upgrade which I did not consider beforehand.    Keep up the good service and will definitely return."
"It was a pleasure to have stayed in Parkroyal @ marina bay. The staffs are very friendly and no fuss in checking in or getting our bag delivered to our room. From this stay, our family actually got the honour to get to know Mr Suresh Singh the chef concierge. He is polite, friendly and offer help to us and my son loves to look for him during the stay. We would love to go back again in the future."
The hotel has been fully renovated recently and transform into a garden paradise hotel with greenery design. The staffs are knowledgeable and helpful in answering hotel guests enquiry.   The room size is good and i liked the RO water feature in the washroom. A slight concern with the room is the soundproof quality. I could hear quite clearly from next door and the issue likely come from the connecting door.
Went back to celebrate our first wedding anniversary with a staycay. Was pleasantly surprised with a complimentary room upgrade and an anniversary cake and small gifts from the hotel all thanks to our wedding coordinator (Sharon)! It made the experience so much more special! The hotel staff are all very friendly and helpful with all our request and they even made an effort to call to check that everything was alright! Would definitely recommend the hotel to our friends and relative. Will indeed be looking forward to stay there again sometime soon! Once again appreciate the effort and help from everyone at Park Royal Collection Marina Bay.
My husband and son love this place.  The room is cosy yet there are still ample space to move about.  Love how the room was designed with the corner that can be used as sofa or bed.  The staff are all so friendly and smiley despite the crowd. They make sure you are well settled in and comfortable during your stay.  The location is good as is near many amenities like food and shopping and public transport.
"This was the old marina mandarin hotel taken over by current management. There were still a number of renovations being done in the hotel during our stay but it didn't affect us at all.  We had lunch both at the peach 🍑 blossom and peppermint restaurants.   Room stay was comfortable and staff were friendly.   Want to give our thanks to Cha from the front desk, Mogan from belldesk, Daniel and Nobel from Peach Blossoms, Stewart and Sarina from Peppermint. Not forgetting staff from one connect. Many thanks for your friendly voices. We shall be back!   For overseas future travellers, there's loads to shop from across, beside the hotel. Loads of food eateries around the area too. You just need to explore.   Recommended!👍🏻"
"Parkroyal collection Marina Bay is still going through some renovation with a little hammering, drilling and fumes of glue on the upper floors. If you are not sensitive to those, then go ahead to book your staycation now with its current low rates.   We did request for a change of room and the noise did subside. The design of the lobby garden in the hotel’ is beautiful with real chirping birds and the sculpture of wind chimes waves hanging at the lobby as a feature is indeed charming. But again if you are sensitive to noise, then you maybe disturbed by it as the birds sing as early as 8am.....Or charmed by it by waking you up gently...Combined with the lobby music, it tend to become quite loud. Not for everyone but it is certainly unique. I am told the pool is a mineral pool but"
"Just had a staycation at this newly renovated hotel. The new decor refreshed the space a lot, and I love the morning chirping of the real birds in the atrium! Super cool touch. Breakfast buffet was good, and the service was very friendly and helpful! Props to Stewart at Peppermint - his professional cheerfulness, efficiency and energy in the morning makes the whole breakfast a great experience! It made my stay!"
"We are writing here to compliment and commend the hotel’s staff excellent service.     It was an absolute delight and joy to have stayed at ParkRoyal Marina Bay on 20th – 22nd Feb 2021.  As we had a wedding to attend at the Singapore Flyer, ParkRoyal Marina Bay was the first hotel we thought of, due to the convenience.     The check-in process was very smooth and we were assisted by Mr Prem who was on duty that Saturday afternoon.  Mr Prem was very courteous and helpful. He even upgraded the room for us, from Urban to Lifestyle King, Room 1237, offered a late check out and even went the extra mile to give us a courtesy call to make sure that the room we stayed in was spacious and that the view was gorgeous. Indeed it was!  We applaud Mr Prem for his attentiveness and"
Thanks to Parkroyal@collection marine especially to the Xina and her team.  Our experience at Parkroyal were great and wholesome. They were so patient is n guiding us on the whole wedding process. And not to forgot the presentation of the food is nice.   The hotel design is like a forest with birds chirping.  We have a wonderful experience and we highly recommended on this hotel.
Love the new “garden-in-a-city” look.  Ambience of the hotel give a relaxing because of the garden feels.  Rooms are brighter and spacious too. So far most city hotel nowadays have standing shower but this hotel have both! 😀  Thanks Sheryl Chua and Janice Tang for this lovely staycation!
"Our first staycation, with my wife, son and parents. The guest service from the moment we checked in till we checked out was simply outstanding.  Our requests and concerns were followed through promptly.  We loved the connecting spacious rooms, the delicious food, the view of our rooms where we can see the sun rise and set and finally the dinosaur soft toy and tepee for our son.  We want to come again.  Hope the food menu will be different by then."
"Since January and feb 2021, this is my 4th times staying in Park Royal collection Marina Bay.  We love the new look of the hotel. A garden inside the hotel.Always got a good ambience from our room. Hygiene and cleanliness is my priority,yes it's not disappointing.  Food is great, Hotel staffs were excellent. They were very Courteous, helpful and take initiative to bring us a smile and great comfort. I would said hotel staff from the Entrance, Check in Counter and restaurants were fabulous. Restaurants were very nice and modern, restaurant manager were very helpful.   Recent stay for my husband birthday, got ba pretty cake. Thank you Park Royal collection Marina. I attached some of the wonderful pictures.  Always looking forward for my next staycation.💖"
"We were greeted politely at the reception during check in. Initially there was some hiccups as we parked at Marina Square carpark and due to renovation, we had to climb the stairs out of Marina Square and walk outside to the hotel. I asked the concierge about it and Suresh managed to make great arrangement for me. He continues to be attentive to our needs throughout our stay.  My husband informed the hotel that it was our son’s birthday and they prepared a cake for him.  The view at the pool and from our room is great. You can see MBS, Pan Pacific, Esplanade and the night light at Esplanade was nice too.  There are Chinese and western Cuisine to choose from for breakfast. Cosy and nice restaurant.  They also have an efficient e-concierge service.  There were some few additional"
Got a reservation in the Pavilion. Food and tea was mostly nice. Ambience was quiet on the Thursday 4pm slot. Mikaela who served us was very warm and accomodating. She helped us take some photos and even recommended where to take nice pictures. Would recommend coming!
"stayed two nights here during Valentine's Day. previously known as Marina Mandarin, the hotel underwent reno works and now has a garden themed architecture in its lobby atrium. that alone is worth the visit and there are interesting perspectives to look at from different angles.   our room was huge and spacious, decor stylish and cosy. however, the bathroom has not undergone reno yet and thus maintains an old school feel. the shower head connected to the tub was leaking water at the sides and we had to inform the recep to send someone to fix. the hinges of the bathroom door were rusty and old.   if you are looking for a pool staycay, then most likely you'll be disappointed. i had set my expectations of the pool low prior to the stay after seeing some photos online. the pool area"
"Had a wonderful stay with my family. Beautiful hotel, very comfortable and clean rooms with friendly staff. Convenient location with Suntec and Marina Square at their doorstep. Lovely breakfast as well! Would definitely come back again!"
"I had an awesome 2 nights stay at this hotel.  The room is neat, cozy and roomy. The personnel seemed so accommodating. I was originally set up  with a queen size bed. The receptionist was so patient with my request to move us to a room with a double bed. They (Collection club team: Lydia, Sueann, Tricia) surprised me on my birthday with a delectable pastries and it really pleased me. There was a little issue concerning the  breakfast cost, but it was resolved with the assistance of  Yushan, Reika, Bryen. Your help is greatly valued.  I can't thank you enough."
"Stayed at Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay over the Chinese New Year long weekend with my family of 7 which included my aged parents. Requested for connecting rooms which was acceded to and checking in was a breeze. This is my second stay here after my short staycay honeymoon with my wife on her birthday in Dec 2020. As expected, the rooms were clean and spacious. The bed and pillows were just right for us, offering great comfort. We just love the day bed in the lifestyle rooms, looking out to the balcony which overlook the Suntec City skyline. It is long enough for a 1.8m man to sleep on.  The hotel also does not hold back in satisfying its guests. When we noticed the nespresso capsules were lesser than the last time we came, we just gave a call through the one connect number at"
"I commend DORIS for her service is extra ordinary. She offered us a polaroid photo as a remembrance. As well as the guy assigned in the pool, awesome service!  The hotel is beautifully renovated, rooms are clean and spacious. Kinda disappointed for the room coffee as Nespresso is overrated, in my opinion. Good thing they have Lavazza coffee as well as an option in our room. I tried their coffee somewhere and it tastes great.   Hopefully they can keep the rooms clean and the service consistent in the future. I'd love to come back here."
The room assigned was according to my preference and Syikin was the one who assisted me via the phone call. Thank you Igor too for the great service during check in! Check out was a breeze too! The room is nicely renovated and have a beautiful city view! Thank you very much for everything!
I had a wonderful experience at the Atrium Lounge.  Staff member Honeyly was extremely attentive and helpful serving me and my son during a coffee break. She is extremely customer service oriented and deserves to be commended by hotel MGT.  She is a credit to your team!
"From the beginning to the ending of the staycation is a real enjoyable, memorable getaway for my family and I.  Having Mr Jackie to help confirm the reservation for our stay on the 3rd option date was bless as we been postponing the staycation trip since Nov for our family birthday celebration at Park Royal Marina Bay as they were under renovation.  At the point of registration, Ms Hailey greeted us with a warm and friendly smile. Registration transaction was fast and smooth as we arrived at 8pm. Every information were explained clearly and detailed. The best is she offered to take polaroid photos of us as a family for a memorable staycation which didnt even cross our mind as we are handful with 2 toddlers (1 special need). Request for late checked out but due to high occupancy,"
"Great service at the Peppermint and I would like to compliment Roy who had served a group of 5 of us during the dinner buffet service on the 31 January 2021. Very attentive and accommodating to our requests, making sure that our dishes have arrived :D"
Spent a lovely staycation with the hotel. Newly-refurbished with lots of wooden concepts and sustainable features. Received ondeh ondeh cake rolls to celebrate our anniversary and also got a free room upgrade with a super nice view and very spacious room. Thanks! Will love to come back again!
"Booked the hotel for wedding anniversary and kid’s birthday. The hotel room is newly renovated, clean and came with masks/wet wipes pack. Quick and efficient check in. Staff was friendly, helpful and detailed. Answered the door twice to receive nice gesture from them."
"The staffs were extremely friendly and helpful.  I visited atrium lounge with my wife last sunday we are welcome by a hostess and was seated in a nice sofa chairs with great ambiance. i really appreciate their staff named Honeyly who pleasantly checked  us, she was very professional in handling our needs without even calling her, very attentive lady. The overall service was impeccable. Despite being busy and under renovation  the service rendered was not compromised.   I was truly impressed and made our High tea worth the experience .  I would recommend to visit this place again, bringing my friends along, newly renovated and has lot of potential."
"Came for a staycation for our 16th wedding anniversary. Room was great,view was great,service was great. They managed to give us a room of our request and they even prepared a small surprise. Much appreciated. Keep it up."
"I truly enjoyed the new hotel. Nicely renovated and staff are very welcoming. In fact this is my 2nd time having a staycation there. I love the rooms which are newly renovated and the gorgeous bay window facing the balcony. They have very nice restaurant, one in particular is called Peppermint. Really good food. Locality of the hotel is excellent with shopping centre just across the road. All is connected easily.  I would really recomend this hotel! would come back again with my family. Also kudos to R. Ravichandran, a executive there...i have seen him and converse with him during my both stay. An exceptional staff who never fails to make us at home there. At one instance he noticed we are having kids trouble and He accomodated to my very young kids and arranged for us to be"
"After renovation the restaurant looks extremely elegant and more spacious. The food here is individually plated due to covid which allowed us to try more varieties and plating is done well, food is extremely delicious too. The light music with the ambience was well thought out and service staff is very polite and attentive. Will definitely come back again. One of the better halal hotel buffets around."
"Deven is a friendly and a good worker, always there to help when you need a helping hand. He is always smiling and never fail to serve with a smile. Always greeting anfd helpful. One of the best in the hotel"
"Upon arrival and check in everything was good. The service,the room (only problem is the toilet door which does not shut completely.) was good. Do keep it up. For the breakfast,we just hope there are more varieties. Overall we did have a good stay."
Great service by the front office team villi and security team Ravi. The room standard is ok for me.. Service is good hight recommend. I have a beautiful welcome by the bellman when I arrive here just now..
"Hotel is beautifully and thoughtfully designed with great views and facilities. Service teams are incredibly service-oriented with observable team synergy and spirit. Each individual we had the privilege of meeting was warm, friendly and took every initiative to make our stay a fuss free and incredibly pleasant one.  Cleanliness and social distancing is very much a priority in this hotel and much appreciated in a time as such. Rooms and facilities are very clean and the in-room service team is very efficient.    Big big thank you to Mr Suresh Singh and his concierge team for helping to make our birthday surprise a success and for making our coming in and going out of the hotel such a pleasant experience. A sincere, helpful and outstandingly attentive and courteous team who takes"
The front desk Bryan and Sarah are very friendly and hospitable. They made our hotel stay a great one with their welcoming spirit! Well done and thank you for a great staycation! Definitely will stay in this hotel again :)
The front desk staff named Bryan and Sarah in Park Royal Collection Marina Bay are very friendly and pleasant. They are so welcoming and really go out of their way to assist my family and I in our staycation. We are really grateful and appreciative of their hard work in this times of pandemic and the hotel is really blessed to have this 2 staff working for them. Thank you.
"Awesome stay at the newly refurbished hotel. Upgraded to the Signature Marina Bay view. Received a surprise birthday treat in-room for my child's birthday. Thank you Lydia, Justine, Syahira, Sue Ann, Cha, Kimmy, Yani, Vili & Yarik."
"We am truly impressed by the warmth hospitality shown to us since we checked in around 1.30pm. Received a ring on the doorbell and to our surprised we were greeted with a lovely cake. Even now that we are having lunch in the restaurant, the wait staff was full of smiles and help, when pass the buffet hours. Such warmth. Truly recommend this hotel to future guests. The best part, the shopping which is just next door. Wife’s favourite."
"Very good Front Counter Officer Mr Bryen excellent, amazing & helpful service to all our enquiries.  You need to have  more good and excellent officers like him in front line services to maintain the good image the hotel.  He is a asset for your organisation"
"Staff was extremely friendly, well mannered and helpful during the 3D2N stay. Especially Effendi (Front desk) whom is very professional and provided a smooth check in. Bookings are simple and convenient with the Chatbot.   Side note, the music at night from the lobby is quite loud, and can be heard in the room. It will be good if the volume can be lowered.   All in all, great job!"
"It was a wonderful experience to have held our wedding dinner reception at ParkRoyal@Marina Bay. Xina, the assistant manager who was assisting us with our dinner, was very pleasant, patient and helpful. Her efforts were highly commendable as she strived to understand our demands in the wedding arrangement, adapting constantly to the changes throughout the planning process as well as in the day itself. Her positivity and her can-do attitude, coupled with her prompt and understanding responses, also added assurance and peace of mind throughout the days leading to the dinner. Our guests also enjoyed the delicacies and the starry-filled ceiling garden ballroom tremendously. Overall it has been a great experience. Highly recommended."
"Arrived to the Hotel lobby was greeted by good staff,  check in was fast and pleasant. Room was wonderful and spacious. When I was wandering around the hotel a staff approach me asking if he could help me and I answer could u shoe me aroundthe hotel and he said yes.  He show me the swimming pool and the gym and even how to get to the marina square with getting wet in the rain.  Would like to say thank you to hasnan for taking the time to show me the hospitality.  Thank you"
"Great experience, wonderful service by hotel reception. Love the ambience and room design. Was served by Christine, Reika and Syikin throughout our stay and they helped us to ensure a pleasant stay. Whole check in process was easy and quick."
"Firstly, we are appreciative towards ParkRoyal for their generous “thank you” offer in rewarding Singapore healthcare worker with free complimentary stays. Being fortunate to receive it, we’ll like to thank you for the lovely stay. Review Although the hotel isn’t eye catching from the exterior, upon entering, one is greeted with a spacious grand atrium that is accented with lots of greens, wood and natural light. Taking the stunning glass elevators to our floor, you get to take it the beautiful, enclosed paradise-like spirit of the atrium. The room is simple yet elegant. All the furnishings seem fresh (newly renovated) with a charming balcony that has a picturesque view of the city. Being honest, the main highlight of the room was the bed. I have stayed in many hotels through my"
"1 night staycation at the newly renovated PARKROYAL Marina Bay (formally know as Marina mandarin) The lobby area surrounds by lots of greenery, wood accents and with natural lights, is like being in a garden. The Room is fresh,clean,spacious and is well equipped with all the necessary amenities and the non-carpeted floor make the room much cleaner feel. And we love the daybed at the balcony area where we can relax and enjoy some sunlight while staying comfort in our room. Booking of facilities is simple and quick too, with the QR code’s and chatbot app. Overall we really enjoyed our staycation, look forward to another stay with the hotel."
"I stay at the hotel on 28th Dec - 30th Dec. Upon check out i forget about my BRAND NEW JEANS which i hang in the wardrobe. I called their hotline to check if i can retrieve back my brand new denizen jeans with braun buffel belt and i was told that they will need to check under the lost & found department and also with their housekeeping. But to my disappointment, I receive a call back from them and they said that their housekeeping claims that they DIDN’T SEE and jeans hanging in the wardrobe while they were clearing the room. Its really unbelievable how can they claim that they do not see it when i clearly remember that i hang it in the wardrobe and its not even a week after my checkout that i called and enquired. This really shows the hotel housekeeping staff are VERY NOT"
"We stayed for 3 nights from 31st Dec 2020 to 3rd Jan 2021. Room was spacious and we love the daybed. We have requested for bay view room but  non were ready yet. The breakfast in our first morning was pathetic, we were only allowed to choose one set either continental or asian or HongKong noodle. It was worst than a 3 star hotel breakfast. The room cost us SG$476 for the first night on new year eve. On the 2nd morning we complained and were given additional dish. On our last night, while preparing to do our isyak prayer, suddenly the air cond diffuser dropped and it almost hit my husband head. The duty manager phoned me and just gave us a late check out at 5pm the next day. He did,, no more staying at this hotel for us."
"Staycay with my best friend. Room is spacious and very comfy. Pool is also good. Not that big but it's not crowded. So can enjoy the pool still.tough there are still renovations going on, it is not noisy in the room. Check in and check out is fast, wish that reception staff could be more friendly and informative. Bfast buffet was fantastic thanks to Alvin and the team. Francis from Atrium Lounge is awesome too! He makes a very good espresso martini good after checking out in the hotel. All in all a super worth it staycay for the price paid. 👍"
"Positives Loved the modern design and vibe of the hotel. The open concept from the level 4 reception to the corridors of the rooms upwards was a breath of fresh air. In the room, I loved the cupboard design, awesome views with the balcony of the bay, full transparent panels facing the balcony allowing full view outside from inside, lots of huge full length mirror in the room. Customer service was great, reception was welcoming and friendly. She addressed my requests that I had on my reservation and explained most of the things well. Restaurant staff at breakfast was also friendly. Tv was big and great. QR codes and chatbot for booking of facilities was easy to use. Loved the filtered water tap.  Can be improved Room had some empty space that could be filled up with either a sofa"
"*5-star stay at the newly renovated Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay*  Was looking forward to the staycation at Parkroyal Marina Bay as it was recently rebranded from Marina Mandarin, with newly renovated lobby, restaurant and rooms. The stay was absolutely lovely. Room is fresh-smelling and clean, and love the non-carpeted floor now as it seems much cleaner than carpets. Room is well equipped with all the necessary amenities, if you need extra items (and to book pool/gym slots) you will just need to scan the QR code on the night stand.   Service was wonderful throughout the hotel. Thank you Kimmy, Hailey from Front Office and also Bowie from Peach Blossoms (Chinese restaurant). We had an awesome dinner at Peach Blossoms, quality Cantonese cuisine and wonderful service. Very"
we stayed at park royal from Dec20th-21st in room 1020 and were utterly dissapointed with the service and room.   we arrived at 11+ and were told that they would give us a call when the room is ready. at 2.55pm there was still no calls from them. my tot and infant was already very cranky then. called them to ask if our room was ready but was put on hold for almost 10 mins. they took that long to check if our room was ready. they then told me that they were getting it ready and will give me a call. we waited till 3.45 and there was still no call. arrived at concierge with 2 cranky kids at around 3.50pm and they still had to check if our room was ready. on the phone when i was checking if my room was ready i asked for a late check out at 3pm since we will be checking in late. the
"Congratulations on your reopening of the hotel. It's really beautiful, a garden in the hotel concept, IG worthy pictures at every corner. Room is spacious as well as toilet. Nothing to fault. Every team member from different departments can be seen doing lateral services during the breakfast period. Everyone serves with a smile despite how overwhelming breakfast period can get. Front Office team to Housekeeping team, everyone I met greeted with a smile behind their masks."
"We dined in the peppermint restaurant at the hotel, with prior reservation.   Due to our negligence, we left a wallet at the restaurant and realised it only upon reaching home. We called back, and managed to contact Jackie from the restaurant. Personally, I am really heartened by Jackie’s quick and reassuring responses. She helped look for the wallet and got back to us double quick time (it was already late and probably near to the close of business for the day; if not past her working hours). She even offered to arrange for a team member to send the wallet to our residence, which we declined trying not to impose too much of a hassle to the team (instead we opted to collect on the next working day). Alvin from the restaurant also helped a lot. Thanks to him too!  On next day, I"
"I had arrived early to register as advised to avoid the crowd, ended up I had to wait in queue to allow them to clear the check-out guests. The staff was quite attentive and explained to me that they need to clear the check out guests so that there will be rooms for check in guest. When my child got cranky, they offered me a room instead of having to wait till check in time. Grateful for that... kids were often given snacks and we also got a nice xmas biscuits.  Rooms were spacious to fit 3 adults and 2 kids. We had to request for an extra bed cos the twin beds were not available and that’s an additional cost of $80 per night. Wished they could be more accommodating to families it’s like everything extra u need is chargeable...   No late check out as well, not even 1pm. When you"
"The check-in was seamless. Waited for about 5 min. Discovery counter staff was very warm and welcoming. Room is clean, though newly renovated but no new paint smell at all. Lifestyle King room is spacious with daybed. Had late check-out. Great staycation! Already planning for the next staycation at Parkroyal at Marina Bay hotel."
"Went for a 2D1N staycation to celebrate my bronze wedding anniversary. Lobby is grand after the makeover. Check in was quick and the front desk staff Ms Doris was very professional and impressed us by doing her best to accommodate to our requests. Room was ok, bed is comfortable but the pillows are not to my liking. Breakfast servings are huge but selection is relatively limited."
"Prior to check in, I have email on request for Birthday cake surprise and room amenities. All was confirmed via email and met on actual day.  Check in was seamless, room was clean (although there are couple of traces of the room deco that you can still see that remind you on Marina Mandarin).  Service was prompt and polite. There is still soft renovation work which you can hear faintly during the day.  Must try is Peppermint buffet lunch, although pricey but value for quality and taste. Only improvement will be the swimming pool is pre booked and slot allocated is limited. We have the last night slot available before pool closed so there is no clean towels at the shelf so we have to return the room battling the coldness."
"Not what i expected on a 4/5 star hotel.  As much as i want to separate the good and bad about our current stay, the only good I can think of is how nice the renovated rooms are. Spacious and visualy appealing.  The bad, here it is:  Check in - took quite a long time considering we are the only one in the counter and its past 6pm already  Room and amenities: this is the first time that i encounter being charged for extra room amenities including pillows! Not normal even on a 4-5 star hotels! And if you charge this, atleast make sure the default in the room is even sufficient. How can you expect a family or couple to share a small toothpaste.  Breakfast: the line is quite long considering we already told our prefered time during check in. Also, no social distancing on the que!"
"Was excited, looking forward to a good and relax staycation since we cannot travel during this period. Checking into the hotel was smooth, the room were spacious and good even with extra bed. We just need to scan the QR code in the room for booking of facilities (swimming and gym slot) even tidying up the room, or request for any items from housekeeping to in-room dining, it was very convenient.  We ordered room service, the portion of the food served was big and it’s very tasty, thou they mixed up my order, the F&B staff manage to come to our room to check and revised the bill accordingly.  Hotel is connected to a few malls (Marina Square and Suntec City) so it’s really convenient. Only disappointment was that the room were not sound proofed. You can hear children running"
"We had a lovely 3 days 2 nights staycation at the Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay. Check-in was smooth and efficient by Bryen at the check-in counter. Our room overlooked Marina Bay with a gorgeous view of Esplanade and MBS. We had dinner there on 2 nights - first at the Atrium where food was good, portions were large but service could have been friendlier; and the second night was at Peppermint where we had the dinner buffet - although we miss the usual buffet spread as this was an ala-carte buffet due to the times we are in, service and food was prompt and of single portions, so we did not overeat! Service staff was friendly and prompt with requests.   Booking facility time slots for the pool was easy with the app - and although it is a small pool, the kids still enjoyed the"
"Experienced a rejuvenated hotel erstwhile Marina Mandarin now known as Parkroyal Marina. Gone are the carpets and mineral water bottles. There is a filter tap and more wood and glasses in the room. Excepting for guests walking on the rooms above you on the laminated floorboards which can get to you sometimes. Probably I got someone heavy up above me. Gone are the booklet for room service and other services in the hotel. It’s QR code all the way. Cool! One thing irks me. With all these gadgets you lose the human touch. Not all is lost it’s take a few minutes to tap in your housekeeping requirements or any other needs. The response is immediate, suppose AI responding to our queries. But execution  could be better. Like I requested for body cleanser that’s your shower gel tube. It"
"I was a big fan of the old Marina Mandarin. The hotel was getting a little old. So I was pleased to learn Parkroyal is taking over this hotel. I had also stayed at the nearby  Pan Pacific a few times, and always enjoyed my stay there. I was keen to see how the newly renovated hotel is going to look like. I’m not disappointed at all . Checkin was smooth. I was allowed an early checkin . The lobby, which was my fav part of the hotel during the marina mandarin days, is now even mote stunning. The greeneries that surrounds the lobby is just beautiful. The room is simple and along the trend of the Parkroyal Pickering. Lots of natural light and simplistic in design. I like it. Renovation is still on going in some parts of the hotel. But I never felt disturbed by that. Service at"
"Is a disappointing stay for my staycation. During check-in the reception was rude. Did not answer my question directly, and not even eye contact. Her name is Doris.  The room condition was not comfortable at all. There are two bright lights that is directly above the bed headboard. The light are very glaring and making me feel headache. The room light switch is not a dimmer switch, hence you cannot control the light brightness.  If you switch off the light, the room would be dark to watch the TV.   Due to Covid-19, going to the Gym need to made booking, I called the reception to make a booking and was told gym was full, so I need to wait for 1hr.  I agreed, but I went down to 5 floor to take a look at the gym. No one was in the Gym !!!   In the toilet, there is a bidet bowl."
