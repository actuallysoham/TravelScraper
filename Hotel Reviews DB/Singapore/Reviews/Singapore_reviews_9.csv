Small but super good service.  Hotel Staff service was excellent and supported our requests readily and promptly.   The experience at Carvery was not as fantastic though. Poor communication (wrong info given to us on 2 occasions) and slow service.
Thanks Park hotel Alexandra and all Staff  . We are enjoyed and relaxed our staycation period in hotel . swimming pool is very clean and good.   Reception counter staff is very friendly. See you next time.
"Hotel room is clean and tidy, there's nice scenery nearby. Pricing is decent. Staff is friendly and helpful. Location is good, there nice food nearby, ikea is next to it and there's anchor point mall opposite."
"Clean, great location and pleasant surroundings and service is good especially housekeeping. Great foods in this area and nice view especially able to view sunset in the room. Highly recommend and will visit again."
"Had a wonderful stay with Park Hotel Alexandra, the staff are very accommodating and allow late check out so we can utilise our credits and stay till past lunch. Swimming pool was great and there’s lots of affordable food choices in the vicinity. Will recommend it to other families!"
"Hotel is clean and staff are friendly .I have enjoyed my stay there , will definitely go back !  There is Swimming pool and gym . Check in and out is fast. Nearby have various food places , next to ikea."
In room dining was delicious. And took only 20mins to arrive upon ordering. Got a free upgrade due to availabile room. Appreciate that.  Their bathrobe was so nice that I asked concierge whether I could purchase. Mr Rhys and kelson assisted to check with room service.  And brought 3 pieces down for me to choose.  Happy me! Managed to purchase their robe.  Both Mr Rhys and kelson is very open and friendly.. able to take jokes.  They really made my day!
"The service is great and that made the whole stay enjoyable.  We are satisfied with the room and amenities.  The view from the room is amazing.  However, the shower water pressure is a bit weak.  We also love the swimming pool."
"This is my 2nd time back at park hotel Alexandra. Me & my fiancée decided to have a staycation back at this hotel again as the location is just perfect! From the hotel to CBD, is just 10 mins away. And from the hotel, just within 5-10 mins there is so many food places and even ikea store. Both our stays, 1 was on 6 Feb 2021 and the another was on 15 April 2021 with room number 1121. Both times we were checked in by Mr. Kelson. He was so friendly and helpful. During our first staycation he gave us a free upgrade of room and also gave a late check out. And during the next staycation we had to check in early as we planned to go Sentosa. We initially thought of just registering our names and heading off, but to our surprise he gave us a room. Excellent service rendered by Mr.Kelson"
Good location just 10mins drive to CBD. Surronding with many shoos and food court and an Ikea store. There are different type of  food and cafe in the hotel itself. Nice swimming pool and Gym with good view which is good for relaxing in the evening. Hotel served good breakfast. Room was clean and cosy. There are hand sanitizer in the lift  and the room have 2 masks  for guests. Guests are well taken care off during this pandamic. Cheers to the hotel management team.
"wont recommend the restaurant. booked my stay but restaurant buffet no slot at all, they told me their restaurant ALWAYS FULL. have to book 2-3 weeks before. oh well~ the service is bad as i went for their breakfast and take away.."
"It was a pleasant stay! Well located with many great food options nearby, staff service was good and room was comfortable. Water pressure of rainshower was good. Lovely pool, we enjoyed it much. Recommended!"
"My girlfriends and I love this hotel for its location, F&B & shopping offerings. Above all, we adore the warm hospitality & personal pampering extended during our stays.  While I was awaiting for my Club room, I had coffee served by Paul @ The Carvery. My key card was brought and I was pleasantly surprised to see Kelson(front desk manager) helping to prepare my room.  After a quick chat, I retreated into the chill of the room, with a clear unblocked view of the ‘Shibuya’ crossing of SG & the Southern Ridges.   My fave lounge is by the infinity pool where the bar, Aqua Luna, is also situated. During Cocktail hour, Nancy brought our drinks as well as a fiery platter of bar bites.   Dinner @ The Carvery was cozy and served delectable portions of wagyu burger. When we decided to"
"Check in very smooth, room very modern and the view is nice, bed comfortable, close to all famous food courts and good swimming pool. Don't need to think, just use your $100 voucher to redeem it quickly."
"Had a nice and memorable stayed in the hotel, with very nice view from room window. Would like to stay again in future if the timing is right and when the hotel is able to serve up buffet breakfast and other meals and all other facilities back to normal for usage and access."
"It was my first time staying in this hotel and I have enjoyed my stay very much. Firstly I want to thank the staff, Zah for being so patience and answered so promptly with all my questions & enquiries in the email. This has helped to ensure my stay. During the check in, staff, Kelson was polite with a warm greeting. He has also been a great help to assist and explain instructions clearly to the guests. I have informed him the special request that I have sent in the email. Kelson acknowledged and assured all the request would be noted. Thanks for addressing those requests! Keep up the good work!"
"Location outside of city; But that was the whole point of coming to the hotel. Located just beside great food places (ABC Hawker Ctr  & Alexandra Hawker Ctr) where you can find lots of popular food choices in the west of Singapore that highly related. If you want something more commercial, there Anchorpoint just opposite the hotel when can you find your typical to go to food at shoppeing centre; furthermore there are outlets shop located there that you can do some retail therapy.  Furthermore, how can i miss out Ikea @ Alexandra; Where u can plant yourself on their famous meat balls and chicken wings all day long."
"Last stayed 4 years ago. Decided to return for Easter weekend. Everything went well from start with great help from Calson at front desk giving excellent services during check in. Then the disappointment came at dinner time when I have to wait for 45 minutes just to have some ice and cutlery sent to my room. And the items requested was incorrect too. This is not the kind of service I expect of Park Hotel. The sender (big guy from restaurant probably) sounded arrogant during delivery and expect things to be in order when it's not. Missing 2 tea spoon for my dessert.  Overall, while I like the hotel snd service at front desk, the rest of the crew is quite a disappointment.. Please buck up before my next stay, if I choose to stay again"
Cheers to Reservation and check in staff who assisted me in my request. Helpful and efficient. My kids enjoyed swimming in the pool. Location near to good food nearby. IKEA was just next door. Catch the beautiful sunset
We had good couple time. Quaint architectures observed when we took a stroll in the area. Quiet nice cafes nearby. Will be back next time to take our kids into the Infinity pool on level 7. Wide area for shallow pool play.
"Hotel is located in the neighbourhood area of Queensway. Around the hotel there are 2 well known hawkers center, right next to IKEA if you like to have some IKEA dining and 1 mini outlet mall across the street Anchor point and also a sneaker paradise Queensway shopping center.  Would recommend visiting the pool and the bar of the hotel. Nice scenary during the sun set hour for a relaxing evening."
Hassle free and smooth check in and out. Staff are friendly.  Very clean room and location is great (it is near shopping centre and Ikea plus there's a lot of food to eat nearby even for Muslims guest).
"The check in and check out experience was smooth and all staff gave really warm service. We loved the pool and the room was very comfortable. The TV was a little tricky and we couldn't access the YouTube channel but at a staycay, who wants to just watch TV all day right? ;) Will definitely stay again. Thank you"
Your poor staff are overload Please get more staff to ease their workload Only 3 staff to serve the customers They have to multi tasks Resulted in slow serving. Management must do something to ensure their health and welfare taken care off
"Great Stay, beautiful pool view and delicious food at carvery. There are also some nice restaurants just below the hotel. There is also food at affordable range across the street, hotel is located quite central, many buses to different places."
Rooms were tiny and had bad noise insulation . Everything can be heard inside the room from outside which made it impossible to sleep. Every little knock was very obvious and the toiletries given were insufficient.
Value for money. Very friendly and thoughtful Counter staffs especially Mr Ryhs. Comfortable & Clean room. Facilities not fanatics but the Swimming has got good view. Food is just average but not recommended. There are many nicer local food to explore within walking distance especially for Foodies.
"This hotel is highly rated with some great facilities and services offered. However, thanks to COVID I assume, half these facilities and services are not offered. I was informed they were low on staff so couldn't offer the babysitting service. The Crystal Club Lounge is closed off, and you can't access Level 19 upwards. Technically you can only book each of facilities (pool/gym) only ONCE a day via your phone, but one staff member gave me the tip that you can book more than once if you use someone else's phone/device as well. The Coffee Belt stall on the ground floor is closed. When I checked in, they handed me an out-of-date booking/menu sheet with all the QR codes - one for the defunct Coffee Belt - with times for dining at The Carvery that turns out were inaccurate.  The best"
"Like the location, able to access to places of interest easily, and a lot of food varieties around that area.Room is comfortable and clean. Services is also good. Enjoyed my stay there, will go back again."
"1.Booking online  Manage to get 1 for 1 deal after a long hassle as the customer service online had guide me wrongly for the purchase of the deal.  It took awhile for me to sort the issue and to be honest, it was kind of disappointing due to the frustration I had to deal with as I was here for a recharging weekend.  2. Check in I checked in on a Saturday afternoon, it was clear that they are under staff for the check in and  the poor receptionist was being shouted by some customer as the turnover for the room is not as fast as expected. I must say that the manager Hafiz has held up his service standard despite being understaff. The rough estimation for check in takes about 30mins at least if you are looking at checking in on a Saturday.  3. Cocktail  This is another incident of"
"First impressions first, upon arrival. You need to complete an online e-registration form. I was told by the concierge to take a seat while completing the form, and that I would be called back into the queue once I was done. However, I was not called. When I returned to the queue, I was allowed to join it after informing the concierge that I had completed the form. This was a source of conflict for other guests who trusted the concierge's words and watched the queue fill up with people, while they waited for their turn to be called. To hotel management: please educate your concierge on the importance of his wording. ""You may join the queue once you are doing with e-registration"" is very different from ""we will call you to the queue once you are done"".   Check in was relatively"
Great location with great amenities nearby. Swimming pool is nice with a view too however kids pool is a little bit boring as there are no slides. Aircon is cold but takes a long time to cool up the room.
Good place and location. Recommended 100%. So cozy and welcoming. Great view and fantastic service too. Peaceful and quiet. Although there’s no halal food but easy to find halal food outside hotel. Definitely will come back soon
"Amenities are good, rooms are clean and staff are very polite and helpful.  A good staycation experience.  Nearby has quite some nice restaurants and eateries.  IKEA is just next to the hotel. Went there to purchase items."
Stayed on the 13th floor . ( staycation ) Almost hourly there would be some cling clong noise coming over from top of the room ( not too sure if its from the 14th floor ) . Resulting family member unable to sleep the whole night .  No bedroom slippers when first check-in . Called frontdesk / conceige 2 times and they will inform housekeeping but slippers never came . Till we are back from dinner around 9pm plus ( the second time we called staff - afternoon time - can give a sigh over the phone as if customers enquiries are not valid ) . Have to personally go down to the frontdesk and they gave it to you ???  Pillow covers a bit dusty . Developed an itch after sleeping on it .  Dustbin not emptied from previous guest .  Staffs are generally nice . But housekeeping need lots of
Overall good stay and pleasant experience but there are definitely more rooms for improvement. Please kindly refer to the comments stated in the previous feedback form for more details. Thank you very much!
"Enjoyed our staycation! Compliments to front desk Kelson Yeo for his excellent, attentive and prompt service. Also special thanks to Paige at Carvery for her genuine smile and service.  Only improvement needed was the very cold aircon in room - does not change even when we tried to turn it low and 30C."
"not too bad. although there weren't Halal restaurants in the hotel, there were plenty of food places one can find around this hotel. there are hawker centres and you can get your fast food fix (McD, KFC, Subway, etc) over at Queensway shopping centre or Anchor Point. You can also take a straight bus to Tiong Bahru Plaza for movies or more food!  Overall stay was OK. staffs were helpful and friendly. However, do note the rooms can be small to accomodate 2 Adults & 2 Children below 12yo."
"Only ONE person processing the check in especially on weekends and school holiday.  Arrived at 2pm which is the specified check-in time but waited almost 2 hours until our turn to check in. Got into the room, messy and unclean, went down to notify such event. Being given a new and clean room."
"Check in staff is well trained & patience ( MAE). Although my visit is during the covid period, I dont feel that I had been constraint with the extra safe measure in place. The rooms are well kept & maintain it shows that the staff are not affected by the current covid extra cleaning requirement. The breakfast area & food were well prepared & the serving staff make us feel relax. Overall the entire stay was well worth the trip & will recommend my overseas friends to stay here when the border is reopen. Wish the management & staff well & continue the good spirit & work of Park Hotel Alexandra. Cheers..."
"We were from Pasir ris, it's a nice change for the weekend with d great view from our room. Singapore looks different from usual (at least for us) . Rooms are clean . Just hope there is a sheltered pool for babies."
"Waited 6 hours to get our hotel room, even though we pre-booked our check-in time prior to our stay.  Hotel was not busy upon check-in, nor did they have to manage international arrivals with different check-in times. Hence the 6-hour long wait upon check-in is unacceptable by Singapore hospitality standards.  Also, we had to negotiate for a late check-out to make up for the long wait during check-in."
We had a wonderful time here at Park Hotel Alexandra. The facilities was very clean and carpets were as good as new. The hotel is conveniently located at the junction of Queensway and Alexandra Rd and it is very well connected by public transport. We also received great service by their courteous hotel staffs. Keep it up! Really worth the stay!
"Hotel is understaffed and their amenities are not working well.  1) check-in in the evening took a long time as there was only 1 Front desk staff handling the processes.  2) welcome pack (consisting of 2 individually wrapped & a hand sanitiser) was expired. check-in on 5 Mar, expired 4 Mar. 3) same Front desk staff offered me replacements upon hearing of this matter. however it was not individually wrapped masks and he held out 2 masks by the earloops and expected me to use it immediately. Not hygienic at all. 4) Same Front desk staff claims that only 1 carpark coupon could be claimed for a 3D2N stay despite clarifying for multiple times. eventually I approached the concierge staff and they issued 1 per day. 5) club lounge is closed and this was not reflected on Klook website."
"Being school holidays, there was a queue for check-in. Rooms were not ready until around 6 pm, although the staff were really good at keeping us informed and we were offered complimentary drinks and a late check-out. (This appeared to be the norm for the three days we were there). Rooms were clean, modern but probably only comfortable for a maximum of two adults. The bed was comfortable and sleep comfort was excellent - didn't hear (much) noise from neighbours, and only occasional traffic noise from below. Reading LEDS on each side of the bed were available (yay), with a small desk. Unfortunately, no chaise longue available to stretch out to enjoy the view. All other mod cons provided (bathrobes, slippers, safe, ironing board), though I was a little surprised that club rooms had"
This was my first visit to this hotel while my friends are repeat guests. They shared with us their previous pleasant experience staying in he crystal club room.    We checked into rooms 1701 and 1704 and stayed from 16-18 March 2021. It was the school holiday week and the lobby was filled with guests waiting for their rooms when we arrived at about 2pm. We finally managed to get one room at 6pm and the other at 7pm. The rooms are well-kept and clean. Everything was in working order.   We had booked the club superior rooms and were shocked to be told that the club lounge is closed and our evening cocktail relocated to The Carvery restaurant. There is a time limit of 1h for cocktail. We would not be able to “hang out” at the lounge or any other venue for drinks outside the
"A great heart warming experience. Our front desk staff called to check on us and if we were pleased with the room upon checking in.  Thank you Joseph and we will definitely be back again! Room was clean and spacious, view was fantastic from our room as well!"
Good locations next to q mall and Ikea with good customer services with friendly staffs with fast and smooth checkin with nice views for sunset from room! Will highly recommended to my friends and relatives!
"I’m not one to write reviews but my stay at Park Hotel Alexandra deserves this exception.   I booked 2 rooms for our stay on the 12/3/2021 really went beyond our expectations  From the very minute we stepped into the lobby, we were constantly greeted with a smile from Kelson and Rhys, which really just brings that warm feeling back , especially in this covid-19 climate.  We had a pleasant night with comfy mattress and sheets. The rooms were clean and looked so instagram-able. The layout is simple yet has a hint of elegance.  Kudos to the Housekeeping Team  Park Hotel Alexandra as simple as the name sound is well on its way to being a top notch flagship in the hospitality industry, with its well trained staff  Kudos to the General Manager and team for maintaining and training up"
Hotel Staffs are friendly and helpful. Room is clean. Great location. Beautiful swimming pool and Bar for drinking. Great place to chill and enjoy night scenery. Overall it is a great experience in park hotel alexandra.
"Feedback was done to hotel. Had a delayed++ check in.  Club benefits were not up to my standard. Ala carte Breakfast can't have repeating order, wanted more but was stopped by the staffs. Felt that they should have given more alternatives. But I think they have work hard on that day. Thank you too!"
"I enjoyed my stay in Park Hotel Alexandra... Very clean and the ambiance is so relaxing, I love the infinity pool... Breakfast is good and tasteful... The staff is very accommodating especially Rhys at lobby area... We enjoyed also our dinner in The Carvery Restaurant the food is appetising and the staff served you cheerfully...  I want to complement also the restaurant team during breakfast they are very attentive especially Mr. Paul... I will surely comeback in this hotel not only because of the place, it is also the good service of the staffs... Two thumbs up to you guys👏👏👏"
"Excellent location for food and exploring. Short bus ride away from tiong bahru and southern ridges. Hotel didn’t seem very crowded with guest which was great cos room service was quick, pool was pretty much empty, and lifts came almost instantly. Room was clean and bed was comfy."
"Lovely experience. From checkin to checkout, staff were really friendly and helpful. Food was great even though it was for in room dining. The QR code for in room dining did not work so please have a look at that. Overall i'll definitely come back!"
Eventhough I had a 1 night Staycation with my girlfriend it was a very good one as the hotel team tried to make us feel comfortable during our stay despite the current restrictions due to the pandemic. I would definitely come back next time.
"Great short staycay. Convenient for my night escape. Lack of places to eat supper nearby, might be due to covid season. Resorted to having Mac during my stay. Staff assisted to receiving food as I took some time to get to lobby"
"The lady at the reception was really friendly and well mannered. She maintained professionalism but her tone and speech was not too formal;  it did not feel like it was fake or something that was scripted. I felt her genuine warmth welcome and willingness to assist me. I remembered that I apologised and said that I understood I was early for check in but she said, and I quote, “No problem, Maam. I appreciate you coming early for check in.” I was surprised by her response. She complimented me  without me complimenting her first or expecting a compliment from a guest. At first I was puzzled by her response, but later on, I learned that there was a very long queue of people waiting to check in. So, I did not have to wait long. She explained the standard procedures thoroughly and"
Overall stay from check-in to check-out and in between for the service and the food was fantastic and it exceeded my expectations. Really glad I had chosen this hotel for celebrating my hubby’s bday as well as for us to unwind from work and have a nice break during the first ever staycation.
"Staff are attentive, patient and polite. Rooms are clean and pool is beautiful. Thank you for the dessert for birthday too! Would definitely return! Note: Do take premier if finances allow. Rooms are bigger, bathtub fills fast, extra armchair too."
"We had 2 connecting rooms , rooms are small but still ok for our comfort . Pool and restaurant has to be booked using QR code that hotel provided. Breakfast are served in a set with a choice of American breakfast , waffles , Indian curry , nasi lemak with fruits , crossiant, coffee or tea or juices . Overall satisfied with the stay thank you"
"Hassle free check in, room was awesome with a view, and most importantly the hotel staff were accommodating and friendly! There's an ikea right beside the hotel, and harbourfront roughly around 10-20mins away by bus."
"All good. Pleasant stay. Staff is friendly, room was clean. Breakfast for muslims however is quite limited. Meat not stated halal. If not particular on breakfast then its fine.  A note, using telephone from room to make local calls not free of charge."
"Great hospitality from Park Hotel, their staff was very fast and polite, the room was clean and neat. Love their breakfast booking site, it was so easy to use. The breakfast was good too !! Just sadly there isn’t any buffet breakfast due to Covid, but all was good love my stay !"
酒店环境很好，还有一个超棒泳池，晚上景色很不错。 房间里面配备齐全，电视有很多频道，喜欢看HBO。Room Clearance也很及时，基本都是一天一次的。 早餐种类特别丰富，有中式，西式，还有马来特色的早餐。超赞！ 酒店的服务人员十分热情，晚上还送fruit basket上门，值得推荐！ Overall its a great hotel and I have a good experience!
"I would like to commend all of the service staff from the concierge, front desk, room service staff to the servers at The Carvery, everyone was friendly and sweet - I do not fail to see any smiles on any of their faces. As someone who is very particular about great quality service (as I came from Changi Airport's strict service quality standards and the GEM's programme), I came to love all of Park Hotel Alexandra's great service and for many who went the extra mile to ensure that my family and I had a pleasant stay. Thank you to every single one of YOU for having me experience such a wonderful birthday weekend at your hotel! I will definitely visit again whenever I can and would love to experience your suite next. Do also lookout for my review on Booking.com and Google - all of"
Awesome and friendly service. Mr Kelson was amazing with his service. Will definitely come in again as I really enjoy the hospitality and the friendlyness of the team here! The amenities and the facilities are all super user friendly! Really enjoyed my stay!
"Have a great staycation with my family. Nice hotel room with nice view and friendly hotel staff. Due to Covid-19 situation, the Breakfast is served in sets rather then buffet style, but overall is still good."
"Check in/out- smooth & hustle free. Staff- at both the Reception and Gym counter are quite courteous & helpful. Special thank to Mr Kelson for quick response to request. Room condition- facilities are well maintained taking into consideration the hotel has been in operation since 2015.  However the resolution of most of the TV channel (including local programmes) are not HD (1080p), though not critical but can be improved, considering HD is common now."
"Stayed there for 2D1N last Friday with my family to celebrate our anniversary. Hotel staff were very friendly and the lobby feels cozy. Checking in was fuss free as I did the pre check in online. Swimming pool and breakfast slot also booked online due to covid19. Thanks for the anniversary card and dessert. Love the room, so clean and new. View is nice too! My one year old love it a lot. Baby cot was prepared prior our arrival. Overall very nice experience, will definitely book again! Thank you to the team !"
The staff and hotel exceeded my expectations. Had to find a place to stay because of renovations at the flat and the location was perfect with good connectivity transport wise. The price fit my budget and the view from the room was nice.
"The front desk staff are friendly and greeted us upon arrival. Kelson from the concierge gracefully upgraded our room to Crystal Club room and even granted us a late check out. Even the room is smaller than expectation, the cleanliness is on point and the view from 18-storey was magnificent. As it was my wife's birthday, the hotel surprised us with macarons and fruits!  Due to Covid-19 restrictions, breakfast buffet was not available. F&B staff was courteous in taking our orders and was surprised with the delectable spread served to us. Not to mention, the sky pool is well maintained and accompanied with good music and beverages from Aqua Luna. Thumbs up!  The only drawback is that the room TV is not connected to the hotel's Wi-Fi. This means that we could not watch any Netflix"
We used our SRV Vouchers to booked. Appriciate the hotel gave us a complimantry upgrade. The room is decent for 2 adults. But not for 3 adults or 2 adults and 2 children.  We had the view facing the whole queenstown area. The location is great. Ikea is just right beside. Markets and kopitiam/shopping malls is at a walkable distance.  The room cleanliness is good. Need imporvement because we can see watermark stains in the toilet and some dust on the bed when checkin.  Overall is a very pleasent experience
Was greeted and welcomed by their friendly staff. Hassle free check in. Nice and cleam room. Love the swimming pool and bar. Very convenient to get food. Overall is pleasant stay. 2 thumbs up for everything.
My partner booked us a 3D2N staycay at Park Hotel and took me to Hydrodash on the second day which was just a short bus ride away! The room was small but cosy and clean. I loved the bed and had a good sleep on both nights! Would visit again!🥰
"Chose park hotel Alexandra to celebrate our anniversary. Location is great, right smack in the heartlands, with many food options around. Everything from check-in to booking of facilities was fuss free, Even got complimentary dessert plate from the hotel for anniversary! Will definitely be back soon"
"Had dinner with a group of friend at The Carvery. Glad to have chosen here instead of downtown Chinese restaurants. Located at Level 7, close to the pool and pool bar. The ambience was lovely. A'la carte buffet of good choices, value for money. The Yu Sheng is different and delicious compared to the norm you get at Chinese restaurant. Service staff, friendly and attentive, checking all the time whether you need more. Portion can be big so order smaller portion to enjoy all the items in the menu. Besides dinning in, you can order online too. Definitely will come back but this time overnight😊"
"Staff are very friendly and attentive especially the entrance attendant who is very helpful.  Social distancing of all areas are well taken care. Beds are very comfortable, probably should provide more complimentary bottle drinks (2 bottles are not enough)."
"For a staycation with the family, it is really a good and relaxing experience for all of us. We have used the facility and rested well. Thank you to the courteous housekeeping staff who had catered to our requests."
"Lots of eateries options around. We took a cab to Sentosa at less than $10, just a 10min ride away. Pool was empty compared to other hotels in town where you can’t even book a slot. Clean room well equipped"
The hotel is clean and staff was polite and customer oriented. The view from the room was great too! The location of the hotel was convenient and made it accessible to all other locations in Singapore.
"We really enjoyed our stay here, the place is really nice and relaxing. The infinty pool with its romantic view during sunset. Our breakfast that was served with great service plus a complimentary voucher makes our stay extra sweet. Will be back here for sure. Thank you Park Hotel. Kudos to all staff."
"We had a pleasant stay, the pool is so nice and we’re able to stable in the pool bar and enjoy. The executive room has a very nice view. 💕. Mr Jumaat is very helpful and friendly and the rest of the staff."
"The location of the hotel is great and with lots of nice food nearby! All the staff who are stationed at hotel lobby ( check in/out counters, concierge), the Carvery restaurant, Aqua Luna and swimming pool are very friendly towards the guest. We love the pool as it’s big and with jacuzzi! Would love to come back here again for a short stay! :)"
Overall a great experience. Hotel amenties were great. The experience espeically provided by Vanessa Tan was very thoughtful. She was very friendly and  looked after our needs very well. We had a pleasant experience under her care and service. Thank you Vanessa!
"Early check in and late check out was good. However breakfast service was poor, either didn't serve the food items or incorrect food served. Under staff during CNY, and staff kept on apologising to each table. We send 2 laundry for washing but upon check out, had to ask for it and amazed that it wasn't even wash after 24hrs. They will send to our house but it's already 72 hrs, still haven't received it. Not sure where the hotel send the laundry for washing."
"Positive: - adorable staff, very helpful - great pool, and very nice poolside bar as well! - cosy rooms (not the biggest, but still great and functional)  Improvement points: - breakfast food is expensive for the quality you get"
Location wise was good. Finally a change instead of east side. Room was good but would be better if toilet have biget so no need go to the shower when after doing bisness! Hehe but overall very satisfying.
"Very conveniently located to lots of food options around, great place to go for nature walks just a stone’s throw away, places to shop at, and just a good mix of old local public housing estates, black and white colonial housing and new condos with international food options. I’ve not been in this area much and this has been really nice break away to rediscover singapore ."
My family and I had an awesome 1 night stay! Everything was smooth from checkin to checkout. Mr Juma'at greeted us with a warm smile. His service & the hotel staffs is awesome! Friendly & Courteous!⭐⭐
"I traveled alone from China to Park Alexandra on the age of 19, alone, and stayed for half an month here. It is such a wonderful time! Everyone I met is patient and caring (juma’at, and many other whose names I can’t remember that well—sorry!) Though far away from home, Park Hotel Alexandra indeed feels like another home for me. I definitely cherish the time I spent here and will bring my parents with me the next time! ;)  happy lunar new year everyone, you did a great job!"
Mae greet us with a warm welcome and explained to us clearly about the hotel policy. She also gave us a free room upgrade with a very significant view. We enjoyed our short stay. Thank you for your excellent service.
"Everything is great and professional. Room a tad small but still acceptable, well space is a premium in Singapore. The service staff here are extremely friendly and professional. Swimming pool have great view."
Friend was getting for a gift as birthday present .feeling surprised in the morning received a cal for management That in a while will be sending and passing some to me directly . Very thoughtful that remember when is my birthday
Mae & Kelson was very helpful throughout my short stay at Park Hotel. I wish I could have more words to describe their warm hospitality but they were nothing but marvellous. Anyway kuddos to everyone. The only thing was the communication between my son n the hotel but all is well thank you.
I had a great stay at Park Hotel Alexandra. Thanks to kelson at the reception who is very accomodating. Breakfast is good too. The pool is very nice too. Surely worth staying here. I’d love to come back here. :)
"We had a lovely stay! Great attention to our comfort and birthday celebration from the Park Hotel Alexandra team, felt at home every moment of our stay. Fully recommend this hotel as I trust they are very consistent in delivering a 10/10 service. My friend was delighted to receive a surprise from the Park Hotel Alexandra team. Excellent, clean and safe destination that we look forward to visit again. I highly commend the team of friendly staff from poolside, restaurant, front of house, housekeeping and night shift etc. who made this A+++ staycation possible.
