       " '\"We stayed here a couple of times and we will definitely come back. Very friendly staff, special thank to Oum Chart Som and to the doorbell. Very good value for money. We like the comfortable beds and the closeness to MRT and BTS train station.\"',\n",
       " '\"I had been here for many times. The hotel located in the middle of two shopping malls. MRT station is located in front of the hotel which super convince for tourists. The hotel is surrounded by many restaurants. Moreover, the hotel has good facilities and services. The staffs are also very nice, especially khun.Nan and khun.Chat.\"',\n",
       " '\"I picked this hotel due to its proximity to Chatuchak market and would use it as a great base again. The MRT is right next to the hotel entrance and gives you direct access to the market - cheap and easy. The hotel staff were all really professional and welcoming, and the pool is a great size for Bangkok. Room was lovely and clean and everything made it an ideal spot for shopping.\"',\n",

       " '\"This is our 3rd time in this hotel and it is located conveniently close to Don Mueng airport and Jatujac weekend market. Breakfast is very delicious and the ladies at the reception are just amazing, Ms Jeda, especially, and others. And the pool is clean, and cool. We can only recomend this hotel. We will def come back again.\"',\n",
       " '\"A bit far from bangkok center , if u are looking for a peaceful stay in Bangkok, go for it. To reach the center sky train facility is available, which is very convenient from the hotel. Staff behavior was very good. Have a nice stay at the hotel.\"',\n",
       " '\"One of the best hotels I have stayed in in Bangkok. And the best part is that it is immediately next to the metro stop ... so travel within Bangkok is easy. It has a nice swimming pool, nice lobby and the rooms are extremely well appointed. and nice wife signal in the room. Also nice mixture of European and Asian guests. Also, nice staff. For sure, we will stay here again.\"',\n",
       " '\"The Quarter is strategically located beside Station 31 of the Blue Line MRT and across Union Mall. Location is convenient to cater with your immediate needs. Though the location is quite far from most tourist destinations, it will only take you 40 mins and cost you around 200 THB if you travel by Grab (car).   The staff are great and very accommodating.\"',\n",
       " '\"We immediately felt welcome in the hotel. Even though we arrived a couple of hours early for checkin, receptionists Chat and Oum were extremely helpful and arranged that we had a room (with a great view) ready and available almost immediately. This was particularly helpful after a long journey with a tired crying toddler. The other staff were also very helpful, arranging our luggage for us. The hotel is also conveniently located, the rooms are modern and  hotel facilities are great. I would definitely recommend to stay here.\"',\n",
       " '\"Very nice hotell, big pool with lots of sunbeds and a really professional gym. The breakfast is great. It\\'s clean and all over fresh and modern.  Great value for you buck spend. Very helpful staff, thanks Karl\"',\n",
       " '\"Most I like about this hotel is very good pool area and very good fitness. Neigbourhood offers some shopping(Union Mall 1min away), eating(good Kao Soi restaurant 1min away), entertainment(live music bar 1 min away) opportunities. Area is mainly local thai people and not so turistic. Good breakfast with variety of choices, restaurants offers thai seafood barbecue deal dinner for about 1.500 baht. Highly professional and friendly staff, especially receptionists Jida, Jane & Chat.  I will come again to this hotel.\"',\n",

       " 'The hotel is one the best I have ever stayed in. The room is sparkling clean and the bed is nice and comfy. The wifi speed is fantastic and the best part is that we can stream our mobile content through chromecast inbuilt in the tv. I will never hesitate to comeback and refer people to this property. A special shoutout to Jida and Chat from the frontdesk who ensured our stay was as best as possible. Keep up the good work people. And the breakfast was outstanding. Lots of western and local choices on offer.',\n",

       " 'We reached the Quarter after more than a full day of travel and it felt like an oasis. We arrived early because of flight times but Jida was extremely welcoming and understanding to help us get settled in :)',\n",
       " '\"Great hotel with a modern/minimalistic style in the rooms, has all the amenities that you\\'d need along with a great view of the city as well. Fairly easy to find, especially if you are arriving by subway/MRT which is just in front of the hotel, or you can spend 5 minutes walking from the skytrain/BTS to reach the property.  Room was of standard size for Bangkok and has a balcony and spacious bathroom as well, and a great rain shower which is always a plus.   Service was quick and efficient, in the evening I sat by the pool and had a couple of beers and G&T, which for the price value was excellent to just sit there and chill.\"',\n",
       " '7 eleven right below the hotel.  Plastic surgeon clinic right beside.  Massage salon less than 1 min walk.  Good massage and reasonable price.  A bit out of tourist place but Grab n taxis easy to get . There is a nail salon next door stated open every-day but we stayed there 4 days 3 night was not open at all.',\n",
       " 'Upon arrival we were early and Jida had checked us in and helped store luggage. We returned at 2pm and found a very updated room from what we may have expected. The pool area was nice had adjacent restaurant but lounges had no padding had to ask for pool towels. We stayed 2 nights and had a great experience. Food and drinks in hotel were priced as expected for this type of accommodation. Breakfast was included in our package. Mall across street and subway to access easily. Nice place would return.',\n",
       " '\"Pleasant service and hospitality by Khaw, Jida and Jane. The check-in is very smooth and the room is clean. We would love to stay here again on our next visit to Bangkok. Should consider taking the breakfast next time.\"',\n",
       " '\"I love their friendly and good service at The Quarter Ladprao.  Due to earlier flight , I reached hotel before 10am . And I just try by chance to check the room availability for earlier check in with the staffs at reception ans they greet me friendly with a smile.. and said to me, “we will check for you now “ and within few minutes they manage to find a room for me. In addition , they explained to me the earlier check is subjected to the room availability and depend hotel traffic, .And I am totally understand it and accepted happily.   I am so happy and they make my day as I need a room to take a rest now ... thanks to the staff , Mr Khaw, Ms Jida and Jane..  Definitely come back again !!!!!\"',\n",

       " '\"We stayed 5 nights at the Quarter Ladprao after the Christmas. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The room is clean and the bed is comfortable. No microwave in the room likes the Quarter Ari, however the location is more convenient and easy to access to both MRT and BTS plus shopping centres nearby. Be aware of the room near the store room, it is noisy in the morning. The pool is decent size and the sitting area near the pool is spacious. The downside is smokey smell from the restaurant if there is a bbq cooking. The gym is good size and opens to both hotel guest and the public.\"',\n",
       " '\"We got a big and soft bed also with nice bathroom. Staff was very nice! There are service like Sauna, Drink and Showering after we checked out. LUV IT The location is quite near to Department store. Security is great too.\"',\n",
       " \"The bed was as hard as the floor. I booked 3 nights but checked out after one sleepless night. This isn't a 4 star hotel. If you don't mind the concrete firm bed it's situated in a area with a few restaurants and shopping centre. 7/11 next door. I will not be returning in 9 weeks travelling this year in Asia this is the worst bed and night's sleep.\",\n",
       " '\"we stayed here one night I went to the hotel to check in earlier than expected, but the Liga receptionist, Art helped us check in early, she made my trip very good.  , the hotel has a beautiful view from above, I highly recommend that everyone come here, once again I would like to thank Liga, Art\"',\n",
       " '\"My experience was great : the hotel is very-well located (100meters from the metro station phahon yothin - don\\'t mix with the other one phahon yothin24 which is far away), brand new and clean. The breakfast was perfect and...until 10:30.   Special thank you and 5 stars to Liya and Jida staff\\'s member who were very kind and helpful.  We stayed 2 nights with my wife. We, then, had to come back to Bangkok at the end of the week, we choosed again this hotel.\"',\n",
       " '\"I got very good service from staffs(Miss.Jida & Miss.Kan) Thanks for you kind. Clean room with good location for shopping , yummy street food and food court. Swimmimg pools and Fitness are good equipments. Have a coupon for welcome drink. I will be back again.\"',\n",

       " '\"Our stay has been nothing but pleasant at the Quarter Hotel. From the moment we arrived we felt welcome and taken care of. They even give you welcome drink coupons that we later used at the restaurant.  Deluxe room is definitely worth it. It is much bigger and nicer. We requested a quiet room on a high floor. That is exactly what we got. Our room was on the 12th floor facing a quiet alley. The view from the balcony was amazing at all hours of the day. Smart TV, comfortable bed, clean bathroom with the necessary toiletries, fridge, umbrella, safe, hangers and tea, coffee, water stocked daily, etc., everything we possibly needed was provided. The rooms are cleaned very well daily.  The breakfast buffet is yummy with many choices. Every staff we met was super nice and always\"',\n",
       " 'Location is superb with loads of stuff to eat around.  Check in was a breeze with Liya / Art with their warm hospitality.   Room is very trendy and modern. I would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for nice place to stay around',\n",
       " '\"Great location; a lot of restaurants and stores near the hotel, and the most important part in travelling is they have lot of access in transportation like train, taxi and etc.   The front desk staff are really accommodating especially LIYA and AUM. They are also good in english. Thumbs up for these two!   The breakfast buffet is quite good for 200+ thb. I wish there is cheese varieties to choose next time and more Thai foods. Over all, the best hotel in Bangkok is The Quarter Ladpra by UHG :) Affordable and Worth the experience.\"',\n",
       " '\"All staffs from Breakfasts/Dinning area in this hotel provide \"\"Outstanding Customer Services\"\" and perform extra miles job.  Each day, you will be greeted by them with \"\"Beautiful smiling gesture\"\" and they make you feel warm and welcome and  starting your day with wonderful experiences.

You got 2 malls across the street. 3 mins from union mall and about 8 mins walk to central plaza mall. Food everywhere anytime. Breakfast is ok. Value for money. Keng and Bas at the concierge service were very helpful. They helped us to book a car everyday. Very satisfied.',\n",
       " '\"We stayed for 3 nights at this hotel. The location is very good, next to the metro station, not very far from the center.  Nice hotel, clean, acceptable breakfast.  The only minus is the noise (it has thin walls), but it compensates for a lovely staff that can help a lot if you need anything. If you find at the reception Oum, Best, or San, you\\'re saved! They managed to do early check-in for us and change the room because of the noise.\"',\n",
